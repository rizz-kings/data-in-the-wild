# data-in-the-wild / rizz-kings
This is the GitHub repo associated with group rizz-kings' final exam project for course:<br> **KSDWWVD1KU**/*Data In The Wild: Wrangling And Visualising Data*. <br>
<br>
**This repo contains all code- and data used to produce the final report.**

#### Data
The data used for this project is collected from two types of sources: 
- Movie Review Sites
- Movie Metadata Databases
<br>
All movie reviews across different sites are stored in: <br> https://github.com/rizz-kings/data-in-the-wild/blob/main/data/processed/all_reviews.csv <br>
Movie metadata is stored in: <br> https://github.com/rizz-kings/data-in-the-wild/tree/main/data/processed/movie_stats <br>

#### Notebooks

The notebooks folder contains notebooks used in every step of the project. <br> imdb_reviews.ipynb is the main notebook used to gather all reviews from imdb.com. <br>
<br>
Most Notebooks within this folder should have self-explanatory names. Paths across all notebooks should be consistent and the requirements.txt file contains all packages used in the project. <br>

#### Scripts
The scripts folder contains .py files mainly used in the data collection process. <br>
