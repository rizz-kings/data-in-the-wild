0,18 July 2019,masonsaul,9," Extremely fun origin story
","Ant-Man is an extremely fun origin story and a superb addition to the MCU. Paul Rudd is incredibly charming in the lead role with Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas and Michael Peña giving great supporting performances. The CG is great and the action sequences are extremely impressive. The humour works really well and it's consistently funny. Unfortunately, it does suffer from the weak villain problem that some other Marvel movies suffer from.",/review/rw3282825/?ref_=tt_urv,Ant-Man_(2015

",ANT-MAN is another light and breezy Marvel superhero movie conceived as a stand-alone introductory piece. The story is about a down-on-his-luck thief who ends up stealing a body suit that has the power to miniaturise him instantly. He then uses said suit to go on a heist to retrieve some important technology from a maniac. The film is set in the same universe as the Avengers films and contains some clumsily shoehorned-in references to the franchise.,/review/rw3282825/?ref_=tt_urv,Ant-Man_(2015

","After three years in prison cat burglar Scott Lang finds it difficult to find work so soon gets involved in a robbery. His criminal contacts have learnt about an old man with a massive safe in his basement they don't know what it contains but given the security it must be valuable. He is rather surprised to discover that all it contains is what looks like an old biker-suit. He takes it and tries it on later suddenly he shrinks to the size of an ant! It turns out the suit's owner, Dr Hank Pym, intended for him to steal it he wants somebody who is a skilled burglar to use the suit for a very specific job. Initially Scott isn't interested but inevitably he is soon pulled in. Hank explains how the suit works and tells Scott that he is worried because his former protégé Darren Cross has replicated the technology and intends to sell it to the highest bidder. Scott won't be working alone; he will have support from Hank, his daughter Hope, his three criminal friends and lots of ants it turns out Dr Pym has developed technology that enables ants to be telepathically controlled! Ultimately Scott, in his Ant-Man suit will have to face Cross who is wearing his fully armed 'Yellowjacket' suit.",/review/rw3282825/?ref_=tt_urv,Ant-Man_(2015

For example, it requires a certain suspension of belief that whole cities can be levitated. But it's called ""Science Fiction"" for a reason, right?

It's funny all the way through, it has some pretty horrifying scenes, and it includes a new set of characters fans can immediately fall in love with. There's nothing quite like a criminal becoming one of the most famous superheroes. Paul Rudd outdid himself introducing us to Ant-Man, and I'm really pleased with Marvel's choice to cast him. Michael Douglas plays a very good sarcastic, angry Hank Pym. There are a couple scenes that are a little mediocre, but they're not bad even then. The movie's paced well and has a sleuth of great moments, making it one of my favorite Marvel movies.",/review/rw3282825/?ref_=tt_urv,Ant-Man_(2015

","For a few brief moments, the unstoppable juggernaut that is the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) looked like it was about to grind to a halt with Ant-Man. Unlike most other films under the Marvel Studios umbrella, this production has been haunted by doubt and dissension. Fans were nervous about the narrative decisions to relegate Hank Pym – the original Ant-Man in the comic books – to the sidelines, while killing off his wife Janet Van Dyne (who, as the Wasp, is one of the founding members of the Avengers). Then came that hugely publicised parting of the ways between Marvel and original director Edgar Wright, who oozes so much geek cred that people understandably mourned his departure from the project after years of development. And yet, the final product – Peyton Reed's Ant-Man – is a fun, frothy delight, one that proves once and for all that Marvel knows precisely what it's doing and where it's going with the most crazily interconnected movie-and-television franchise of all time.",/review/rw3282825/?ref_=tt_urv,Ant-Man_(2015

","Once again, there's a guy who needs to take over the world and side with a horrible group. He has money and fame and yet he has to go over to the dark side. In this case, he has taken previous research and molded it to his own devices. Michael Douglas first developed the ability to close up molecules and make things turn smaller with intense strength and capabilities. Then he loses his wife and drops from the scene. His right hand man, an ambitious jerk moves ahead and plots evil use of the findings. Paul Rudd plays a poor guy who is divorced. He was sent to prison for a burglary which had some unfair circumstances that led to unfair results. Pyn, Michael Douglas's character, realizes that he has to stop the next step or these bad guys will take over the world and brutalize it. Rudd becomes Ant-Man, not just because he can become small, but because he learns to run with the ants. Of course, the whole thing is high on the hokeyness meter, but, then, it is comic book stuff. It is fun and exciting and works pretty well. It leads to some pretty sappy results, but this is not Fellini or Bergman.

14,28 June 2021,aidanratesmovies,10," One of my favorite Superhero Flicks
","By far the most underrated Marvel film ever made, Ant-Man is an incredibly fun little action flick that will make you smile from ear to ear. No drama, no bs, Ant-Man's pure focus is to bring a good time to the audience- and it truly succeeds. Between the fun visual gags, quirky sense of humor, and Rudd's charming antics- there is very little do dislike about this movie. The only flaw I really have with the film is the villain. Corey Stoll certainly tries his best in his role as Darren Cross, but it can often be a little too much at times, and his character itself feels rather thinly written- obviously to only serve the purpose of being the films antagonist. That all being said, the yellowjacket suit in the film is incredibly well done, and obviously the Ant-Man suit is perfect as well. Besides Stoll, I truly did enjoy all the performances at hand. Rudd is the obvious standout, capturing his signature charm into a peculiar hero I don't think I could ever get tired of. We also have the great Michael Douglas in a great supporting role, as well as Evangeline Lilly and Michael Pena as our other standouts. The film is incredibly entertaining from start to finish. It's almost two hours long, but you'll feel like you'll want more once the credits role, and even more after. In the end, Ant-Man is a criminally underrated little superhero flick (no pun intended) and just may be one of the MCU's best.",/review/rw3282825/?ref_=tt_urv,Ant-Man_(2015

Sure enough, Marvel has surpassed my expectations and turned something I thought would be lame and uninteresting into something hilarious and actually pretty cool.

","Ant-Man has been through a very long development, it was started with Edgar Wright committing to write and direct the film, but years went by and Marvel finally has a studio of its own, manipulations do compromise Wright's vision which lead him leaving the project. In spite of that issue, the film spares much of his screenplay as it still has his trademarks all over the place. While it's delightful to notice those sequences being left intact, there is still a dejected feeling of what it could have been if he actually handled it entirely. For now, most of the style is basic Marvel. As a movie itself, it's quite refreshing to see a superhero film that doesn't contain much heavy handed explosions compared to the last few films they gave us. And it's a good reminder that joy can still be found in this genre even at its smaller scale, thanks to its engaging cast and downright appealing personality.",/review/rw3282825/?ref_=tt_urv,Ant-Man_(2015

46,17 July 2015,Troy_Campbell,6," A light-hearted adventure.
","Even by comic-book movie standards, a thief who can shrink himself to the size of an insect – as well as being able to telepathically control ants – is a totally bonkers premise for a blockbuster. As their sensational Guardians of the Galaxy proved, however, Marvel Studios isn't afraid to take left-field ideas and turn them into cinematic gold. It's a shame then, that Ant-Man is more of a mildly diverting setup for phase three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, rather than a wholly entertaining flick that can stand on its own two legs. It's also arguably the least action-centric Marvel film to date, with barely a punch thrown or weapon fired until the final act, save for an unexpected (and highly enjoyable) scrap between the titular hero and a recognisable face. Where this idiosyncratic heist flick scores big points though, is in the comedy department. With a script worked on by Edgar Wright, Joe Cornish and Paul Rudd, it's hardly surprising to find a tongue-in-cheek tone and a healthy splattering of jokes; Michael Pena's goofy sidekick bagging the biggest laugh with an energetic monologue. On leading man duties, Rudd is eminently lovable as burglar Scott Lang – his effortless charm ideal for such a breezy adventure – whilst Michael Douglas brings gravitas to mentor Hank Pym. Coming so soon after Terminator: Genisys gave us a decent-looking youthful Arnie, the digitally de-aged Douglas in the opening scene here is scarily good too, with the CGI staying at a top level throughout. Devoid of an interesting villain and largely lacking in thrills, this is somewhat of a missed opportunity in the Marvel universe. Yet with a strong protagonist (who will be superb when thrown into the Avenger mix), a solid gag rate, and a light-hearted mood (resulting in a PG rating), it's an amusing film suitable for the whole family.",/review/rw3282825/?ref_=tt_urv,Ant-Man_(2015

As a matter of fact, he has been so successful that he is even considering using his research on humans. And the one thing he doesn't want is for his project to fall into the wrong hands. So in order to prevent that he has kept the most important research strictly to himself. What he doesn't count on, however, is his devious assistant ""Darren Cross"" (Corey Stoll) maneuvering behind his back and taking over the corporation and continuing with the same research with a goal to sell this technology to the highest bidder. Meanwhile, another man named ""Scott Lang"" (Paul Rudd) has just gotten out of prison and is trying to make a new life for himself. Unfortunately, few places want to hire a former convict and in a moment of desperation he is convinced by some friends to break into the home of a wealthy man and steal all the money and jewels from the safe. But upon finally cracking the safe all Scott finds is a strange uniform and nothing else of any value. Realizing that this is rather odd Scott eventually puts on the uniform and discovers that his body has shrunk to an incredibly small size and that there are dangers all around him because of it. It's at this time that he hears a voice in his helmet which advises him on what to do next. What he doesn't know is that the voice belongs to Hank Pym and that he has been chosen for an assignment of incredible proportions.

81,23 July 2015,ironhorse_iv,8," Ant-Man was kinda marvelous.
","Indeed, action comes in all sizes. Directed by Peyton Reed & written by Edgar Wright, Joe Cornish, Adam McKay and Paul Rudd. This movie is based on the Marvel comic book property of the same name. It marks the twelfth film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the last entry in the MCU's Phase 2 slate. It was a great anty-hero movie. Its story follows Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), a convict who is bailed out of prison by retired inventor Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) for One Last Job: to steal Pym's research from his former company, before it can be abused by the firm's new owner Darren Cross (Corey Stoll). To accomplish this, Pym outfits Lang with the ""Ant-Man"" suit, a piece of technology with the ability to both increase the wearer's strength and shrink them down to the size of an ant. Now, armed with this astonishing ability, con-man Scott Lang must embrace his inner-hero and help his mentor, Dr. Hank Pym, protect the secret behind his spectacular Ant-Man suit from a new generation of evil villains. Without spoiling the movie too much, I have to say Ant-Man pull all sorts of antics! It was alright for the most part, but there were some things that 'bug' me about this film! First off, the whole movie is very clichés. Everything about the protagonist is kinda mediocre. The whole idea of him, having few legitimate prospects, and a young daughter and ex-wife to pay child support to, but wanting to commit one last job in a heist film before he retires from a life of crime is so overused. I saw this trope, in thousands of films. It's kinda boring. Another thing, is the whole corporate sabotage plot. It remind me, so much of the original 2008's Iron Man, film. I really didn't sense, much originality with it. Paul Rudd is alright as Ant-Man. It shows that he put, a lot of work, into the film, not only by helping write the story, but beefing up his body, very physique. Still, I didn't really see much of his comedic side in this film. By far, the best thing about the Ant Man is his ability to work with the Ants. I really wish, the movie focus more ant-training montages, than Scott, working a safe heist with his ex-con buddies. I really didn't like those characters, too much. I found them to be a bit one-dimensional negative stereotypes. Michael Douglas as Dr. Hank Pym was fine, but it was a bit odd, seeing an older season Oscar winning, American actor like Douglas in a film like this. Still, he really deliver in whole, passing the torch, the mentor type role, very well. At first, I was very against Scott Lang being the Ant-Man, instead of Hank Pym, but I can now understand why, Marvel chose Lang over Pym. Hank Pym's past was indeed pretty dark. It might be a little too-family unfriendly for a Disney/Marvel film. However, I wish the filmmakers took the risk, and deemed Pym as Ant-Man, because it would make this film, more memorable. I would love the film to tackle, his several split personalities issues, his abusing relationship with his wife, and his fall to the dark-side, by becoming Yellow-Jacket, and making Ultron. It would make a very complex film. Instead, the movie plays it, off a little too safe. Evangeline Lilly as Hank's skeptical daughter, Hope could need some work. While, I know, she's there to showcase, her wanting to become the superheroine, the WASP. The chemistry between Scott and Hope is a predictable ""opposites attract"" storyline. I could rather, have that storyline, cut from the film. While, the Marvel Comics 2 comics, Hope van Dyne/Hope Pym was an Ax-Crazy villain called Red Queen. Although she is on strained relations with her father in the film due to her mother's death years ago, she's more-or-less on the side of good here. I really doubt, she'll end up as a villain, in the next couple of films. However, Corey Stoll as the megalomaniacal villain, Dr. Darren Cross was an interested choice. He didn't shine, as much as I thought, he should had. While, Corey Stoll is a tremendous actor, his character was a bit underdeveloped and lackluster, when it comes to his plans. I don't why he couldn't sell, the goo gun to Hydra!? That's seem like a powerful weapon! The movie, Yellowjacket costume was indeed very threatening, and menacing. It's a lot better, than the silly comic-looking version. Still, it's too similar to the Ultron comic book design. I got often confused, coming into the film, on who's who. When it comes to the action, the movie did wonders, with the shrinking effects and some of the de-aged effects. I did like it. I did think the movie, overused the CGI, a bit much. Some scenes were really hard to believe in. Then there were some that were hard to see, due to the small ant-man flying around on the big screen. I would had, focus more on close-shots, than wide shots. The movie pacing is an alright, but it get a bit antsy toward the end. The movie has tons of Easter eggs and inside jokes to make comic book fans, laugh or take notice. Look forward to the Avengers and Stan Lee cameos. The after scene after the credits, will tickle your fancy. Still, my favorite, had to be Darren Cross jokes that the concept of a shrinking human sounds like a ""tale to astonish."" Ant-Man made his debut in the comic ""Tales to Astonish"" #27, by the way. Still, there were a few jokes that were bothersome. The whole product placement gag, with Baskin Robbins was a little forced and Michael Pena was a little too annoying at times. Overall: Compare to the other Marvel Cinematic movies. Ant-Man wouldn't stand out tall, but Ant-man won't go away! It's permanent! It's a small wonder worth checking out! Go see it, if you want to.",/review/rw3282825/?ref_=tt_urv,Ant-Man_(2015

","I remember a long time ago when they first released ""leaked"" footage of Ant-Man screen tests or something like that. It was a poor quality video of ""Ant-Man"" kicking some guys butts. I thought it was a joke. Marvel had finally hit rock bottom. This would finally be the film that broke their incredibly impressive streak. I have always said that certain Superheroes simply do not translate well to live action. However, I suppose if anyone can do it, it would be Marvel/Disney who have single handedly changed the face of Cinema over the last decade with their Superhero Universe they have created. Did they need Ant-Man? No. Should they have done it? Not in my opinion. However, its not a total wash. Ant-Man was indeed okay and I'm impressed that they were able to pull off even ""okay."" I think this should have been made into a film geared towards a younger crowd. Start a ""Marvel Kids"" Universe. It would have worked much better because the entire concept of Ant-Man looks ludicrous. Although its also one of the most impressive parts of the film is that it relies so heavily on ""perspective"" special effects, meaning how the world looks from Ant-Man's view when he is super-small.",/review/rw3282825/?ref_=tt_urv,Ant-Man_(2015

Scot lange played Paul rudd shows a vulnerable side
The main character, Scott Lange, is not a billionaire or scientist or ancient god, and he doesn't have super strength or intelligence; he is a thief who deals with holding down a job or not but when a job comes along he finds something or kinda faith plays a part in a job he stumbles upon that might save his life in San Francisco and her earns to be able to see his daughter. This makes him incredibly relatable. Being played by Paul Rudd doesn't hurt either. Rudd, along with the rest of the cast, delivers a memorable performance. The idea of a father trying to reconcile his relationship with his daughter may have been used before, but Evangeline Lilly and Michael Douglas make it work without seeming trite or overused. The role that really stands out is Corey Stoll as Yellowjacket. He is, in my opinion, the most terrifying villain the Marvel universe has seen yet. He doesn't want global domination, he wants money and power, and that makes him a very believable villain. Stoll's performance is more three-dimensional than one might expect in a super hero movie, and adds to the already great cast. 8/10",/review/rw3282825/?ref_=tt_urv,Ant-Man_(2015

","The least godly of all the Marvel heroes, Ant-Man is just a mildly intelligent, crafty guy, down on his luck but pure of heart, who catches the eye of a reclusive genius and becomes heir to his technological throne. It's not intergalactic like Guardians, it boasts no billionaire playboys like Iron Man, no political intrigue or mythological hijinx like Cap or Thor, and while all of those absences do make it feel like less of a heavyweight, they also give it a unique sense of relatable identity. This is the little guy (womp womp), one of the unwashed throngs, who dares to climb Olympus and greet the immortals. I can get behind that. It's also a great showcase of the merry Marvel mojo, casually blending well-timed wisecracks with steep ideas, loud action sets and a heavy dose of worldbuilding. That constant sense of a shared landscape, long a cornerstone of the comic book's universe, has begun to bear ripened fruit recently, and Ant-Man profits from the mere association. Truly, it's his interactions with the characters we already know, no matter how secondary they may be, that makes this seem like more than just another origin story. Paul Rudd does a nice job of pulling off the leading role, not too wacky nor too straight-laced, and his essential chemistry with Michael Douglas (the aforementioned genius) carries the picture a nice, long distance. Great effects work gets us the rest of the way, with a whole armload of inventive, fascinating, smirk-inducingly cool expositionary scenes leading the charge.

Consequently, it comes with a sigh of relief that the latest newcomer, ""Ant-Man"" (**** OUT OF ****), shrinks from such apocalyptic pretensions.

Miniaturization is the cornerstone of this clever little yarn.

Similarly, the next major movie to magnify shrinkage, director Richard Fleischer's ""Fantastic Voyage"" (1966), scaled down scientists to microscopic dimensions and injected them into a comatose scientist's bloodstream to save him from a lethal blood clot. Appropriately, television capitalized on all things minuscule with Irwin Allen's ""Land of the Giants"" (1968-1970) where the crew and passengers of the Spindrift, a commercial sub-orbital transport spaceship, traveled into treacherous outer space turbulence and then crashed on an unknown planet. Everything loomed twelve times larger on this peculiar planet than anything on Earth making for 51 exciting episodes.

One of the more unique additions to the MCU this throws out some good (if derivative) special effects and nifty action scenes, but it stays strictly within the confines of the origin tale formula making it difficult to shake an inherent feeling of déjà vu. Lacks a compelling villain or well-drawn supporting characters, and fails to take any real chances, but has enough gratuitous cameos and in-jokes to keep dedicated fans interested, and goes a long way on its sense of humor.

Great movie yes,,very family orientated and the special effects while at times both excellent but occasionally a bit tepid do not override the storytelling. Some good laugh out loud moments and hugely enjoyable with a well written script it keeps the audience happy. The only problem is maybe Marvel are pushing out too much stuff and it could start to get a bit overdone. Lots of references to other Marvel heroes started to make me feel as though we were being taken just a little for granted and left just a tiny hint of a slightly bad taste. The ending definitely says sequel and you just know he is going to join the Avengers which made this film feel as though it was just an advert for the whole Marvel bandwagon. It should have been a stand alone film with it's own back drop and ideas. Having said that the audience all loved it(including myself) but I get the nagging feeling this might just be a bit too much too soon.

It's also a movie that caused some movie people to raise their eyebrows when the original director Edgar Wright parted ways with Marvel over some ""creative differences"". What was it exactly, we may never know, though there's been speculation about the studio and producers like Kevin Feige forcing on the other aspects of the MCU onto what is an origin story mostly unto itself about Dr. Hank Pym restarting his Ant-Man design with thief Scott Lang (Michael Douglas and Paul Rudd, both cast by Wright). Whatever the case, we now have the movie we have in front of us. For me, I saw little things that did indicate it was still Wright's work (and he shares script and story credit with Joe Cornish, along with Rudd and Adam McKay), while still being basically a fairly safe comic-book movie.",/review/rw3282825/?ref_=tt_urv,Ant-Man_(2015

I enjoyed it for what it is, even if it's probably one of the last Marvel movies I'll be in any hurry to rewatch anytime soon. Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly are fine but do little to impress. Corey Stoll is a generic villain, forgettable in every way. Michael Peña and T.I. do a good job in their comedy relief roles. Anthony Mackie is fun as Falcon in his brief appearance. The best part of the movie, somewhat surprisingly, is Michael Douglas. I had doubts he would approach the part seriously, as a lot of actors from his generation look at comic book movies as an excuse to be campy. But he doesn't approach it that way and shines throughout the movie, easily overshadowing everyone else. I thought the scene where he was de-aged with special effects was nicely done. The effects were pretty good overall. The major negatives for the movie are that it never feels like it amounts to much and there are no memorable set pieces. There are so many ways to approach the character of Ant-Man, humorously and dramatically, that would have been more effective but also more risky. They chose to play it safe and I suppose I can't fault them for that. As it is, it's an enjoyable lightweight action comedy.",/review/rw3282825/?ref_=tt_urv,Ant-Man_(2015

The cast is solid and has good chemistry, and the movie is pleasantly humorous. The action, though there is not a lot of it, is exciting. It includes great special effects, largely in sequences when the hero shrinks and controls ants to aid him.

","I expected an MCU film starring Paul Rudd, and co-written by him, to be competitively funny with Guardians of the Galaxy. But it's not even close. Even the Thor & Loki movies have bigger and more frequent LOL moments, and those are films starring non-comedic actors in non-comedic roles written by non-comedic writers (with the exception of Thor: Ragnarok). Ant-Man is still a humorous film thanks to Michael Peña, and Paul Rudd's humor is good fun but it's never knee-slapping hilarious. None of this is a knock on the film, though, which overall is an entertaining origin story that unfolds in a fun way. My knock on the film is from the unbelievability of some of the characters' motivations. I can suspend belief for shrinking technology and superheroes and any other science fiction you throw at me. But it's harder for me to suspend belief when it comes to human behaviors, and I find it very hard to believe how trusting Dr Pym is in Scott Lang and his new acquaintances: a group of felons, hackers and burglars. There seems to be some gaps in the screenplay for how and why Dr Pym came to believe Scott to be ""just the guy,"" to don his suit and become Ant-Man. I get that Pym was impressed by Scott's Robinhood heroics that landed him in prison in the first place, but he never even spoke with the man and now he's entrusting him with his greatest secret and invention? Then, the leap in trusting his buddies to participate in the heist, and divulging those secrets, is too unbelievable. These are flaws with the screenplay that should have been addressed but I'm the writers felt that since this was basically as a comedy script, no setup is required. Most of the MCU films do a fantastic job with character motivation and authenticity, so for the Ant-Man writers to glaze over that lack of authenticity as if it's unimportant, or to hope the audience won't care, is slightly disappointing but it won't ruin my enjoyment of the film.

Paul Rudd plays Scott Lang, a non-violent and very likeable crook who is just being released from prison and decides that he wants to start over to provide for his little girl. But he is unable to hold down a job. He is offered a job - to break into a safe in an old man's house. But he finds nothing in the safe except for a strange suit. He goes home and tries it on - and winds up getting involved in a breaking-in job to save the world.
(Again, I apologise about the bad movie synopsis).
Paul Rudd is great as Lang. He is charming and hilarious. Though, I have one qualm with Lang's character - he tends to spoil some truly great or emotional scenes.
Michael Douglas is amazing as Hank Pym. The calm, straightforward man who hires Lang, Douglas really brings him to life.
Loved the way they handled the budding romance in this and there is some well-done character development.
The shrinking technology was fun and sometimes hilarious to watch - particularly in the climax.
Some have called this 'weird' or 'odd'. While I can understand why they think this way, I don't think it is. It's science fiction and great fun to watch. Great fun and really engaging. Loved Luis and his storytelling scenes. It's cheesy, but a fun cheesy.

The usual mix of fine action, eye-popping visuals and set pieces (my fave is Lang's intro to the suit's powers winding up on the dance floor of a rave with gigantic honies stomping along none-the-wiser to their tiny counterpart far, far below their titanic toes!) with humor, panache and a decent origin story that manages to incorporate The Avengers, good ol' Stan Lee cameo and the luscious Lilly as Pym's combatively willing daughter Hope (spoiler alert - sadly no um, interplay with Rudd ala Brobdignagian bedroom scenes ; so see her in IMAX to get the giantess effect instead!) Wonder what filmmaker Edgar Wright (who gets a screenplay nod with Joe Cornish, Adam McKay and Rudd himself) would've brought to the mix (he left after creative differences), however director Peyton Reed (must admit an odd choice) delivers the mega/micro goods!

","As a latecomer to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I had heard a lot of negative opinions about Paul Rudd and Ant-Man. A few of the preceding instalments in the series (namely Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World and Avengers: Age of Ultron) were quite frankly bad films, with very weak plot lines and very sloppy writing. This was much better. I love how these Marvel films experiment in crossing the boundaries between genres. In Ant-Man, we see your typical superhero origins story coupled with a classic heist movie. And for perhaps the first time in the MCU, our title character and hero is a down on his luck, ordinary (and relatable) guy just trying to hold down a normal job and maybe get to see his daughter at weekends. Our antagonist of Darren Cross (AKA Yellowjacket) is also a breath of fresh air, as his motives stem from a want of power and wealth - again more relatable than the Marvel accustomed seemingly groundless want for global destruction and genocide (think Aldrich Killian/The Mandarin, Malekith, Ultron etc). Overall I look forward to seeing more of Paul Rudd as the MCU progresses, right back on track.",/review/rw3282825/?ref_=tt_urv,Ant-Man_(2015

","Marvel Studios loves to flaunt their skills. They made comic book/superhero movies a cultural juggernaut, nailed the idea of a shared cinematic universe, and proved that even their strangest properties can have a home on the big screen where audiences will embrace them. If GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY didn't prove that Marvel can pretty much do whatever they want, ANT-MAN does. ANT-MAN was probably their highest risk venture since the original IRON MAN; a wealth of behind-the-scenes struggles gave the impression that the movie might never see the light of day and left some of us wondering if whatever was left would taint Marvel's amazing track record. Well, ANT-MAN has come and gone and, no surprise, Marvel nailed it. Our hero in ANT-MAN is Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), a cat burglar freshly released from prison who hopes to turn his life around so he can spend more time with his young daughter. Society proves hesitant to forgive a feloneven when his crime was punishing a corporation for ripping off its customersand Scott starts to wonder if a life of crime might be his only option after all. Rumors of an easy score lead Scott to break into the home of Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), a genius inventor with former ties to S.H.I.E.L.D., and the discovery of the fabled Ant-Man suit. Of course, Pym was the one who started the rumor to test Scott's thieving skills because he needs the ex- con's help. One of Pym's former apprentice's, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), has nearly cracked Pym's technique for shrinking matter by lessening the space between atoms and he intends on selling this incredibly dangerous tech to the highest bidder. Pym needs Scott to become Ant-Man and use the incredible shrinking ability to pull off his most incredible heist yet, saving the world.",/review/rw3282825/?ref_=tt_urv,Ant-Man_(2015

","Marvel Comics created many great superheroes that have graced the screen and become especially big in the 21st Century, but the title character of this next incarnation was not a household name, but this movie certainly looked worth a go, directed by Peyton Reed (Bring It On, Down with Love, The Break-Up, Yes Man). Basically well-meaning thief Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has been released from prison, he moves in with his old cellmate Luis (Crash's Michael Peña), he is determined to go straight and get a job to provide child support, this is the only way his ex-wife Maggie (Jurassic World's Judy Greer), now engaged to policeman Paxton (Blue Jasmine's Bobby Cannavale), will allow him to see his daughter Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson). Unable to hold a job because of his criminal record, Scott agrees to join Luis and his crew to commit a burglary, he breaks in past security systems and cracks the safe, but he finds only what looks like an old motorcycle suit, but he does take this home. Scott tries on the suit at home, and accidentally presses a switch that causes him to shrink to the size of an insect, Ant-Man, he survives a flush down the drain and onto the streets before returning to normal size, terrified by the experience he returns the suit to the house, but he ends up arrested. Former S.H.I.E.L.D. scientist Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), the homeowner, visits the jail and smuggles the Ant-Man shrinking suit into Scott's cell to help him break out, at his home Pym explains that he resigned from S.H.I.E.L.D. after discovering that they attempted to replicate the suit shrinking technology, Pym's former protégé Darren Cross (Non-Stop's Corey Stoll) is close to perfecting a shrinking suit of his own, the Yellowjacket. Pym manipulated Scott through Luis into stealing the suit, it was a test, he wants him to become the new Ant-Man to steal the Yellowjacket, Pym's estranged daughter Hope van Dyne (Lost's Evangeline Lilly) has been spying on Cross despite her strained relationship with her father, she helps train Scott to use the technology of the suit, to fight and to control ants. Scott is first sent to steal a device from the Avengers' headquarters, where he briefly fights Sam Wilson / Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Hope shows anger towards Pym about the death of her mother Janet (Hayley Lovitt), he explains that she was The Wasp and disappeared, whilst disabling a Soviet nuclear missile, into a subatomic quantum realm, he warns Scott this could happen if he overrides the suit's safeguards. The Yellowjacket is perfected and Pym is invited to the unveiling, Scott meanwhile, with the swarm of ants, flyers, builders and others, infiltrates the building, sabotages the servers and plants explosives, but Cross traps him, he intends to sell both the Yellowjacket and Ant-Man suits to Hydra, led by Mitchell Carson (Martin Donovan), Scott manages to escape, Carson flees, and Scott pursues Cross, while the explosives detonate and the building is destroyed. Ant-Man and Yellowjacket fight until Scott is arrested by Paxton, but Cross holds Cassie hostage to lure him into another fight, but this time Scott shrinks to subatomic size to penetrate Cross's suit and sabotage it to shrink uncontrollably, Cross is killed, Scott disappears into the quantum realm, but tampers with the safeguards and manages to reverse the mechanism and return to the real world. In the end Paxton covers for Scott in gratitude to keep him out of prison and allow him to be with his daughter, Pym wonders if his wife is also alive in the quantum realm, Luis tells Scott that Wilson is looking for him, and Pym shows and offers Hope a new prototype Wasp suit. Also starring Wood Harris as Gale, David Dastmalchian as Kurt, Tip ""T.I."" Harris as Dave, Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, John Slattery as Howard Stark, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America, Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes and Stan Lee as Bartender.

You almost ignore the fact that you may not have heard of the title character before this film was made, you buy into it fairly quickly, and there's small references back to the Avengers, you can just settle back and enjoy the fantastic special effects that take you into the microscopic world of insects and create fast-paced chase and fight sequences, and there is funny stuff too, all together it is a fun action adventure.

Still, there's plenty of fun to be had during the swift and sometimes emotionally-resonant narrative, especially considering that it manages to ostensibly be a comedy without calling attention to itself (in the way something like 'Thor: Ragnarok (2017)' does). In this way, it feels very natural and character-driven, comically and otherwise, throughout. It's also able to keep its core players keenly in focus at all times, making for a generally more personal journey. This results in a picture that's actually rather distinct from its peers but still very much sits among them, an example of an entertaining and engaging superhero film that finds its footing as something not entirely encapsulated - or, indeed, determined - by the broadest definition of that moniker. 7/10",/review/rw3282825/?ref_=tt_urv,Ant-Man_(2015

This very much upsets his relationship with his young daughter, Madison, who still adores her biological dad. Nevertheless, she also loves her new stepdad (Bobby Cannavale), a policeman, and her mother (Judy Greer) and lives happily with them. One day, astonishingly, Scott receives information that his sentence is commuted. But, there are strings. A famous scientist, Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) has requested his services in a serious heist. Pym, you see, has invented a special suit, Ant-man, which allows the wearer to shrink to various sizes, mostly that of an ant. But, an unscrupulous underling, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), who Pym fired, is also brilliant and has perfected the technology himself with knowledge gained from his former boss. Pym is a good guy while Cross has no problems selling his invention to the evildoers of the world, for a high, high price. Therefore, Scott is needed to shrink down and steal the parts that make Cross' operations work. It's dangerous. Meanwhile, Scott is also distracted by Pym's lovely scientist offspring (Evangeline Lilly), who has been secretly working against Cross. Can Scott pull this risky mission off and will he ever see his daughter again? This highly entertaining film has a, first, a strong cast. Rudd has his comedic ""nice guy with baggage"" role down pat while Douglas is very fine in his secondary part. Lilly, Cross, Cannavale and the rest are also quite nice. Especially funny is the trio of ex-cons who aid Scott in his new life. The script and direction are strong, too.

","This movie made me realize that we've seen too many superhero films in the last few years and sadly, it looks like thats the plan for the next 5 years too. The film made me realize a few problems that Marvel movies have. First, they try to tie in all movies into the marvel universe. Now a passing sentence or a clever remark are good, they don't detract from the whole movie and pot but here, the plot is sidelined to make space for a fight between a pre existing superhero and the films protagonist. Plotwise, that scene meant nothing and it detracted from the villain that then feels less important. Marvel has a villain problem, they aren't relatable and are very much like bond villains, very similar to each other (movie to movie), always have the same powers as the hero and always die at the end. Lastly, female characters are vastly underutilized to the extent that the plot doesn't make sense. In this film, Hope is the perfect person to use that suit but is put on the sidelines for Scott Lang. Of course this movie isn't all bad, its pretty funny and the performances are good (somewhat too comedic for me), the cgi is breathtaking at times and i really wanted to see more of Scott's discovery of the miniature world. The movie really does suffer from the whole marvel movie universe and has the same feel to it and ends up very bland.",/review/rw3282825/?ref_=tt_urv,Ant-Man_(2015
277,24 July 2015,matthewssilverhammer,8," Fun and Light Marvel Offering
","The best Marvel movies work by effectively bringing their larger-than-life characters down-to-earth with quippy, self-zinging humor (The Avengers, Iron Man, Guardians of the Galaxy). Ant-Man's creators clearly have noticed this and are running with it. By casting the slyly funny and effortlessly charming Rudd as their size-shifting lead, they've anchored their tone in comedy all the while pushing the larger plot forward (notably, towards Marvel's Civil War). So even though it's somewhat unremarkable and full of the superhero clichés we've come to expect, Ant-Man passes as a middle-of-the-road MCU outing with refreshingly lightness and an immense sense of fun. You know the story: a troubled guy becomes a superhero to fight a bad-guy version of himself. One thing that makes it stand apart is its genre eclecticism. While it's certainly a comic-book movie, its cat-burglaring protagonist gives it more of a Mission: Impossible feel. Throughout its silly scifi contrivances and connections to the larger Avengers-protected world, we get small-scale heist set-pieces to counter the great Honey, I Shrunk the Kids style effects and changing perspectives. This narrower focus enhances the personal stakes between the colorful characters. The performances are great, with some solid dramatic turns by Lilly and Douglas, with Rudd and Pena being wonderfully hilarious. Unfortunately, these two sides to the thespian-coin (comedy / tragedy) don't always blend perfectly, with the tone bordering on goofy when the film tries too hard. Some lame been-there, done-that hero posturing slows the otherwise breezy levity that carries most of the movie. Luckily, that levity combined with unique action and funny people propels this fun little adventure tale past its faults.",/review/rw3282825/?ref_=tt_urv,Ant-Man_(2015

","Review: For a movie about a superhero ant, I actually didn't find it that bad. Michael Douglas plays Dr. Hank Pym who has a unique formula to shrink people and give them superhero strength but the company that he works for, wants to use his experiment for war, so he resigns and builds his own company to further his work. He takes on a protégé, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), who votes Hank out of his own company with the help of his daughter, Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), who blames her father for her mothers death. Now that the company is under Darren's management, he carries on with Hanks work to try and create the perfect soldier but he's unable to shrink a human being. Hope soon finds out that Darren wants to do bad things with the formula, so she joins forces with her dad but she still works for Darren and she sends her father reports of Darren's progression. As Darren is coming closer to perfecting the formula, Hank has to find a subject to steal his work back from Darren so, with the help of his daughter, they set a trap to see who can break into his house. Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) plays a thief who is recently released from jail and lives with his close friend Luis (Michael Pena) who is also a thief. After getting the sack because of his history in jail, Scott hears about a job, from Luis and his new found friends, Dave (T.I.) and Kurt (David Dastmalchian), to rob a wealthy man whose away on business. When they finally manage to get into the massive safe, they only manage to find a suit, which disappoints the criminal crew but Scott still takes the suit and he tries it on when he gets home. He then shrinks to a ant size human but he's unable to control his new powers so Hank talks to him through the suit so he can control his movements. When he turns back to human form, he decides to put the suit back but the cops catch him and put him in jail. The cop whose leading the case, Paxton (Bobby Cannavale), just happens to be his ex-wives boyfriend so Scott knows that he's going to be spending serious time behind bars because he has just recently been released. Scott then gets a visit from a man who poses as his lawyer, Hank, and he gives him some clues about how to break out of jail. He then sneaks the suit into his jail cell and he manages to break free, with the help of some ants and Hank giving him instructions in his ear. When he wakes in Hanks house and he agrees to go through some training so he can control the suit and get into the mind of ants, who will be his handy helpers while he's in ant form. Anyway, Hope puts him through the physical training while Hank is putting together the perfect plan to steal back his work from Darren. Hank soon realises that there going to need some help to get into the heavily guarded building so Scott brings in his friends, Luis, Dave and Kurt, to retrieve Hanks work. Scott manages to get into the building through the water system and Luis poses as a security guard and takes out anyone whose going to disrupt the process. The only problem is that Darren has caught on to what there doing and while he's in the midst of selling the formula for a large amount of money, he captures the culprits and goes ahead with the deal. Ant-Man then uses his new powers and manages to escape and save his friends but Darren has built his own suit and goes toe to toe with Scott in a epic battle. Its quite a detailed storyline which covers many elements of the comic book hero and there are some references to the Avengers who obviously will join forces with Ant-Man at some point. I was a bit sceptical about Paul Rudd playing Ant-Man but he done a good job alongside Michael Douglas. There is enough material to keep the movie interesting but I don't think that we have seen Ant-Man's true powers yet. He has the ability to become a perfect Avenger because of his unique powers, so I think that the best is yet to come. With that aside, I liked Corey Stoll as the villain and Michael Pena and his crew did make me laugh. It wasn't in the same class as the first Iron Man but it's an enjoyable movie which has paved the way for a new type of super hero. Enjoyable!",/review/rw3282825/?ref_=tt_urv,Ant-Man_(2015

Harris,Anthony Mackie,Wood Harris,Judy Greer,David Dastmalchian and Michael Douglas. In Ant-Man, Lang must help defend Dr. Pym's Ant-Man shrinking technology and plot a heist with worldwide ramifications. Paul Rudd plays Scott Lang,a burglar who breaks into houses and steals stuff.He was arrested many times but now he's decided to change.Rudd is amazing in the role,he's such a nice and welcome edition to the Marvel hero canon.He's funny,charismatic and committed to the role. Michael Douglas as Hank Pym though is what makes this movie even more amazing that it already is.He is so great on the role and it's so nice to see him actually act again.Even his backstory is truly interesting and I would love to see a prequel all about him. Evangeline Lilly as Hope van Dyne is also very good.I like that she's a strong character and does not necessarily depend on others,I really like where they are going with her character and I'm super excited to see her back in the sequel. The visual effects for this movie are mind-blowing and truly impressive.I really enjoyed the action sequences especially his final throw downs with Jellowjacket.The scope of the battles and the way they decided to direct and present them made me laugh out loud in so many occasions,especially the scene already seen in the trailers with Tomas the Train,which is hilarious and perfectly shot. There are a few story lines in this film,one of them being Scott and his daughter.I liked that story line despite most of the people saying that it felt forced and only put in the movie to make us care more about Scott Lang.I disagree actually because it absolutely did make us care but it also gave the character a reason to wear the Ant-Man suit and it truly worked. The villain in this movie (portrayed by Corey Stoll) is also a complain that I've heard quiet a lot.I disagree here also because in my opinion his intentions and motives from his back story are truly interesting and believable.I also truly liked Corey Stoll's performance and the yellowjacket suit looked glorious.He makes up for some really good looking and overall interesting fights with Ant-Man. The movie faced some problems along the production,it changed directors as it was once going to be directed by Edgar Wright but his concepts and basic story did not fit in with the MCU so they changed it and that is totally fine with me.I liked Peyton Reed's directing and style and I also like the humor in it,most of it being delivered by Michael Peña who every time he talks it's just comedy gold and I was laughing so much. I truly enjoyed Ant-Man,it is a nice and pretty different addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe,with the scale of the movie being much smaller (pun intended) and it being first and foremost a heist movie.",/review/rw3282825/?ref_=tt_urv,Ant-Man_(2015

The shrinking was cool and powerful, but the ants were stupid and seemed to crawl out of nowhere when Scott needed them. In the comics, Ant Man didn't rely so heavily on the ant and more on his own powers. I have to say that Yellow Jacket was really cool, especially his suit. The only complaint that I have is that it looks like he could take down Ant Man easily, but he didn't because it didn't fit the plot. He is by far the stronger person.

How did they mess up letting Evangeline Lilly do what she does best - good, heartfelt, emotive performances? There was no chemistry with any of the relationships (except maybe with Ant-tony). The villain was mundane and barely threatening. Otherwise, the CGI was creative and dynamic, the potential of the bare bones premises are still there. It just fell flat for me.

","I'm not one for big action spectacles where we see New York getting destroyed for the four-millionth time, so I'm always a little worried before I go into a superhero movie. Fortunately, Ant-Man dared to be different than the usual superhero flick like the largely overrated Avengers and abysmal Man of Steel by being a heist movie. Ant-Man, based on the Marvel character, Scott Lang has to use Dr. Pym's Ant- Man suit and plot a heist to stop Darren Cross from making more Ant-Man suits. The suit itself allows the wearer to shrink to the size of an ant while their physical strength increases, making them a virtually unstoppable force. The worst thing I can say about Ant-Man is that it's not as neat and controlled as Marvel's best entries. It doesn't match the tight story of Iron Man or the thrilling nature of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, but it makes up for that by being an incredibly fun and sometimes unpredictable heist movie. A majority of the film is dedicated to showing how Lang attempts to pull of the heist rather than showing non-stop action. It makes Ant-Man feel unique and significantly different than any other Marvel movie I've seen. Most of the action doesn't happen until the final act of the film, but the scenes themselves are very interesting since you see Lang and Cross constantly growing and shrinking. There's also quite a bit of comedy in there, which unfortunately, misses a lot more than it hits.

","Here we are with another exciting action-packed thrill ride from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but with slightly more comedic relief than Marvel's previous outings like 'The Avengers' and 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2'. This new superhero adventure sees Paul Rudd expanding his talent into the action genre, portraying a tiny- sized hero full of charisma and charm. This time around, Paul Rudd plays Scott Lang, a former con man who is released from prison after serving a three-year sentence for robbery and arson. Upon his release, he struggles with securing employment to reconcile his relationship with his daughter. When he volunteers to participate in a heist with his friend and roommate Luis (played by Michael Pena) and his heist team to steal a bag of money, he ends discovering a mysterious suit and helmet that gives him to power to shrink to the size of an ant. He is soon enlisted by Hank Pym (played by Michael Kirk Douglas), the original owner of the suit who sees potential in Scott to make a difference while fearful of putting his daughter Hope (played by Evangeline Lilly) in danger against the powerful enemy Darren Cross (played by Corey Stoll) who possess a powerful suit known as Yellow Jacket.",/review/rw3282825/?ref_=tt_urv,Ant-Man_(2015

For me the best part was that tank and train near the end. So funny, unbelievable, odd, cool.

The more he does it, the better he becomes and thus a movie is born from the classic comic world. I read Ant-man growing up and never dreamed I would see the day where it would be a movie. Wow. There are some parts in the movie that come across to me as corny and annoying but not from Ant-Man but his buddy boys. I suppose they had to include it to keep the movie modern and from getting too serious plus it gives them a way to make the story-line more plausible. It reminded me a little of Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars. An appearance is allowed but not too much screen time as it takes away. The acting gives us reason to consider the subject reasonably but the special effects steal the show. Not only that, but exploring the microcosm world and coming back from it opens up some really interesting possibilities as that world must exist in order for this one to exist. The movie starts out a little slow, perhaps off the mark, but at some point gels and that is when it become interesting almost to the point of glue as it sticks to you and you want it to. Kudos to how they explain Ant-Mans start-up, his powers and how the Ants want a serious player or they don't listen.

This may not be a contender for the best super hero movie, but it is very watchable, consistently entertaining, and with a solid line up of screen talent in which the great Michael Douglas is given plenty of screen time.

","Ant-Man (2015, Peyton Reed)
Like ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" before it when ""Ant-Man"" was first announced I raised my eyebrow quizzically and wondered if these guys were serious. ""Guardians"" far surpassed all expectations. ""Ant-Man"" while being quite good falls into the margin of only adequate as far as the Marvel universe goes. Up until the very end this was a completely stand-alone entry into the Marvel universe and as such felt a bit misplaced although it appears that Ant-Man will make a reappearance at least in the next Captain America film if not more. For the most part though this film really was all on its own and also featured a new hero into the Marvel film lexicon and as such we get treated to another origin story. These origin stories while vital to introducing new and especially lesser known characters tend to lead toward a duller action film because we have to spend so much time introducing the characters and understanding their back story and such. The action we've come to expect out of these films really took a back seat to character development and also as we are dealing with Ant-Man the action scenes were not on par with some of the big set pieces in other Avengers films. One of the major successes here is the casting of Paul Rudd who like many of the casting choices for these Marvel films really seems to completely embody his character. Ant-Man's real life persona is that of Scott Lang who is an adept burglar with a heart of gold who ends up being jailed. When we come across him he is just getting released from prison and in attempt to maintain contact with his daughter he is trying his best to follow the straight and narrow. The path to righteousness is a harder one than he anticipated and in attempting one last score he ends up getting caught and jailed once more but this time he has attracted the notice of Dr. Hank Pym, the original Ant-Man, who developed the incredible shrinking suit and in realizing the destructive potential hid it away from the world until now. Pym's former student cum nemesis Darren Cross is close to developing the shrinking technology and Pym has deemed now the time to stop him and to that end he enlists Scott Lang to become the new Ant-Man. Rudd who seems like an odd choice for a super hero does a great job of channeling Lang's sad sack loser of a man into a humorous, thoughtful portrayal as well as shedding some pounds and adding muscle much in the way Chris Pratt did to portray Starlord in Guardians. Evangeline Lilly comes along as Pym's daughter and initially she resents the inclusion of Scott Lang on this mission as she sees herself as the clear choice to don the suit. This is a good, fun, entertaining film and they do their best with the action sequences they do have but 'Ant-Man' overall lacks some of the large scale excitement of most of the other Marvel films.

394,21 December 2021,TheHonestCritic,4," The title, ""Ant-Man"" also refers to the minuscule size of anything redeemable in this garbage film.
","""Ant-Man"" (2015), all right, let's just get this review over with. At this point, you're probably guessing that I'm not a fan of this ""movie"". You would be right! I'm not a fan of the comic book character it's based off of at all. I always thought that the character and comic stories were dumb and pointless. This live-action ""film"" just does the exact same thing that the comics do, except that it's in the real world, no difference whatsoever. ""Ant-Man"" has a boring and clichéd storyline, standard to terrible acting, and an uninspired generic soundtrack to try and tie this diarrhea dump together. The plot is, a burglar named Scott Lang is armed with a special and unique super-suit with the ability to shrink in scale, while at the same time increasing strength. From there, he learns how to use his new suit to stop an evil scheme and save the world. I thought to myself: ""that sounds interesting, if they can add something new to this common plot thread, then maybe it could work!"" Nope, it just turns out to be the exact same clichéd superhero origin story we've seen a million times before. The only difference, is that it's with different characters, yet it follows the exact same premise. On top of that, the humor in this ""movie"" is nothing short of cringe-inducing, especially from Paul Rudd as Scott Lang. We'll get into more details about him in a minute. ""Ant-Man"" is regarded as one of the funnier films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I didn't laugh, or even smile once. Not one time! I just rolled my eyes, and waited for something of significance to happen. That's another issue with most Marvel movies, they go way overboard with their comedic moments. This ""film"" is one of the worst ones in that regard. Whenever there's supposed to be a serious, or exciting scene, a stupid joke pops up and takes you out of the moment. I'm all for comedy in movies and TV shows, but this is ridiculous. All of the jokes and humor in this ""film"" is so bad, that it's almost at the level of ""Batman & Robin"" (1997). That's how annoying it is! The sad thing is, this ""movie"" did have potential. Unfortunately, it was all wasted and left me with nothing but disappointment! Another huge mistake, is that in the comics, Hank Pym is Ant-Man, not Scott Lang. That's about as big of a mistake as Tony Stark creating Ultron in ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015)! The only somewhat interesting thing in ""Ant-Man"", is the fact that there's a suit with shrinking technology, that is kind of cool. Yet, they somehow made that idea boring. How is that possible? Even though this ""movie"" is less than two hours, it feels like an eternity! As for the acting, it's just as terrible as the storyline. The worst performance, by far, comes from Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-Man. He is just an embarrassment in this ""film"". Need I mention that he also took part in crafting the script? That explains a lot about his performance here, doesn't it? Now granted, I'm sure he's a nice person off-camera. Plus, he has acted well in other movies, and he was kind of funny. What happened to him here? All of the acting sucks to say the least! The only ones who seem to be trying, are: Michael Douglas as Hank Pym, and Evangeline Lilly as Hope van Dyne. They are the only ones who are putting any effort forth with their acting. Everyone else just crashes and burns! Another thing, is that none of the cast members can keep a straight face when they say, ""Ant-Man"". Wow, that's embracing their main character with pride. You know a story is dumb when the cast can't even pronounce the main character's name seriously! As far as the soundtrack goes, it's about as generic as you can get. That's kind of a shock, because the film score was written and composed by Christophe Beck. I was surprised by that, because he has written a lot of great music for other movies! What happened to him in this ""film""? Any way, let's move on to the only two good elements in this piece of crap. The only good things are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are great and give this ""film"" a decent atmosphere. You can't go wrong with filming your movie in San Francisco! As far as the special effects go, they are well-done and still hold up today. Which is no surprise, being made in 2015! The effects where Ant-Man shrinks, and also when he goes subatomic are definitely the standout effects in this ""movie"". Those effects were astonishing to look at! It's just a shame they amounted to nothing. ""Ant-Man"" is yet another embarrassing waste of a superhero film. Is it the worst superhero movie that I've ever seen? No, not by a long shot. But, it's still, by my high standards, a terrible movie. I'm struggling to give this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Unless you're a fan of the comic books, or the character Ant-Man, avoid this ""movie"" at all costs. I'm not even going to bother with the pointless sequels! Like I said, any amount of redemption in this ""film"" is nothing but the size of an ant.",/review/rw3282825/?ref_=tt_urv,Ant-Man_(2015

","For a few brief moments, the unstoppable juggernaut that is the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) looked like it was about to grind to a halt with Ant-Man. Unlike most other films under the Marvel Studios umbrella, this production has been haunted by doubt and dissension. Fans were nervous about the narrative decisions to relegate Hank Pym - the original Ant-Man in the comic books - to the sidelines, while killing off his wife Janet Van Dyne (who, as the Wasp, is one of the founding members of the Avengers). Then came that hugely publicised parting of the ways between Marvel and original director Edgar Wright, who oozes so much geek cred that people understandably mourned his departure from the project after years of development. And yet, the final product - Peyton Reed's Ant-Man - is a fun, frothy delight, one that proves once and for all that Marvel knows precisely what it's doing and where it's going with the most crazily interconnected movie-and-television franchise of all time.",/review/rw3282825/?ref_=tt_urv,Ant-Man_(2015

""I was very impressed by the way you take my safe"" - yeah because good thieves that crack safes don't know that freezing them works good on them. Also how does the suit fit him perfectly when he tries it in the toilet. Also just by the looks of the suit that 10...9...8 timer wasn't enough to do anything especially putting the suit on. What was that ritual to say goodbye from prison - just to show that the hero is also tough? And what was that hispanic music playing? Also have you tried finding something in other peoples homes? I got to say at least for myself that even if they say where that thing is I still need a good chunk of time to find it. He had to find 3-4 things to take a copy of the fingerprint (and this didn't impress Pym but rather the cooling of the safe) and then he had to find the tools to freeze the safe and the process itself - and all this in the 20 minutes when the alarm was off.

Unfortunately for Scott, he's forced in to a situation where he has to 'break in to a place and steal some stuff', for the sake of the world. His new mentor, Dr. Hank Pym (Douglas) wants Scott to stop his old pupil (Corey Stoll) from building a new range of high-tech weapons for warfare. Ant-Man's not your typical superhero-origin story. What makes it a cut above the other Marvel movies is how he becomes the hero. The suit and its powers are odd.

","Ant-Man. A man who can shrink to the size of an insect. Yes, that's right. And he communicates with ants and acts as their leader. After showcasing various colored aliens, a talking raccoon and a lovable tree (later a plant), viewers who were sceptic will be pleasantly surprised as Marvel delivers yet again, though not on a same scale. Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) vows to go clean and stop breaking into places and stealing s**t. That doesn't work out and he is forced to resort to burglary (not robbery, mind you) which brings him in contact with Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), a famous but reclusive scientist and his estranged daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly) who want Scott to save the world and stop his former protégé Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) – by breaking into a highly secure research facility and stealing s**t. That's the crux of the story – a heist movie with a comic book twist, where the hero saves the world. Nothing new about that, right? But It's so much more than that. The story is about the relationship between a father and his daughter, as showcased by the strained relationship between Hank and Hope, who hates him for his withdrawn nature and for lying about her mother's death; and Scott and his daughter Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson), who thinks the world of him. It is also about redemption, as Scott desperately seeks to change his ways to be with his daughter, but gets caught in the same cycle of self-sabotage and Hank who wishes to reconnect with his daughter while trying to save the world. The film also deals with legacy as Hank wants Scott to become the next Ant-Man and avoid his mistakes. Aside from being emotional, the film also is genuinely funny, with Paul Rudd and Michael Pena as his sidekick Luis stealing the spotlight with their comedy skills. Paul lights up the screen with his goofy nice guy portrayal (he is known for his comic roles), and Michael Pena charms you with his funny recollections and accent. Michael Douglas on the other hand plays his role as a grumpy old man and provides a few laughs. Corey Stoll is a tremendous actor, and brings everything he's got to Darren Cross/Yellowjacket, but as has been the case in some of the previous Marvel movies, the villain is ultimately somewhat lackluster and wants for dimension and development (Loki is still the best Marvel villain). His motivations, though clear, are ineffective, often occasionally verge on silly. Having said that, Cross actually serves to ""sell"" us on the idea of a tiny soldier. He sweeps us up with his unabashed enthusiasm for the idea and becomes another tool to coax the audience into embracing the notion of a hero the size of an insect. As for his alter ego, Yellowjacket is the catalyst for some inspired fight sequences. In fact, the action is one of the Ant-Man's greatest assets. It's innovative, often side-split-tingly funny in one moment and strung with tension the next, and is entirely motivated by story and character. The fight between Ant-Man and Falcon at the new Avengers headquarters is funny and exciting. The film has also has heist sequences but they aren't as nail-biting like the Ocean's series. Oh, and the final fight has Thomas the Tank Engine. Enough said. The film has tons of Avengers references such as when Dr. Hank Pym mocks the Iron Man suit technology and states that they are too busy because they are dropping cities from the sky (reference to Avengers 2). There is also a Spider-Man reference in the end of the movie (yay!) confirming that the wall crawler will be making an appearance in Captain America: Civil War (2016). More references are hidden throughout the movie and are fun to think about. The film is however not without its flaws. Some scenes will feel clichéd, like the training montage and the final heist sequence falls flat despite being fast-paced. And the other members of Scott's thieving group aren't well developed and are stereotyped as the hacker and the getaway driver. Despite its flaws, Marvel delivers another strong standalone film with Ant-Man. As is typically the case with the studio's offerings, Ant-Man works as a showcase to the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe, but also delivers a straightforward, fast paced entertainer. The film doesn't require much pre-existing knowledge about the previous movies on the viewer's part. Stylistically one does feel Edgar Wright's (the director is famous for his ""Cornetto trilogy"") original concept, but the movie belongs to Peyton Reed. The affection these creators have felt for the characters is felt by the audience too. And that is what makes this movie special.",/review/rw3282825/?ref_=tt_urv,Ant-Man_(2015

I have found all the films to be pretty great, some not great as others but still pretty good. And now comes the smallest in popularity(other than the Guardians of The Galaxy) Ant-Man! However to fans of the comic universe in Marvel Hank Pym. In this film we get the second Ant-Man, Scott Lang. A con-man trying to get a chance at redemption when the old Ant-Man Hank Pym lets him steal his suit. He become's Scott's mentor so that way Scott can pull of a heist to steal Darren Cross's Yellowjacket and save the world. The movie achieved its goal by introducing Marvels strangest and smallest character in a witty and action packed film filled with great sequences. When Ant-Man is in his small scale you get to see the scope of how big everything around him is. The story is interesting since it's a good heist film(which I don't see often cause Tower Heist sucked) and a shrinking film(which is why it wasn't made in the 80's because of the popularity in Honey I Shrunk the Kids) which is what makes it vastly interesting. The performances are very great especially from Michael Pena who is hilarious and kills it with his humor in every scene he's in. Michael Doglus as Hank Pym is like one of the best performances he's ever done. The direction from Peyton Reed is the best he's done since Down With Love. The film ties itself together in the marvel universe by stopping by a certain facility. It has good wit, characters, acting and the best action sequences since Captain America: The Winter Soldier.

","It's amazing that, despite all of the production issues involving Edgar Wright's departure, 'Ant-Man' turned out good. The film has a consistent tone and manages to feel like one complete vision. Ant-Man's powers make for a unique superhero tale with some interesting action and the origin story is an entertaining one that keeps its characters at its heart. The film also makes a good attempt at humour which, while not always successful, feels welcome as it fits with the characters and isn't out of place. It isn't a perfect superhero film, however.

","The actual plot of the movie is very basic but doesn't mean its bad, it actually fits very well with a movie such as Ant Man. It allows the viewer to lose all focus on a complicated storyline and instead relax and enjoy the comedy and action. The comedy is amazing, it is so expertly positioned throughout the movie. The comedy jumps in between action scenes to slow down for a second but never holds for too long to completely disrupt the flow of the action. The action is obviously good...it's a high budget marvel movie. The casting is on-point. The visual effects are of high standards. My only real negatives are how predictable the movie is and some flaws in the villains character. The villain isn't scary but rather menacing in a way, they seem pretty similar but it isn't. He's more of a threatening character which works well. He's just your average guy which is the problem, he doesn't have to have any incredible powers but he just doesn't stand out to me.

Michael Douglas was good in it reminded me of the way Michael Caine can just play himself in everything but its still always good. Paul Rudd Was Fantastic in this bringing a lot of humor and some decent acting to the table, i cant picture anyone else nailing such an obscure character like Ant-Man the way he did. Evangeline Lily and Bobby Cannavale were both good in there roles. T.I., David Dastmaichain and Juddy Greer were all very funny in smaller roles.

The Directing, production, soundtrack, editing, effects, stunts, writing were all great.

In that way, this movie sorta reminded me of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. Still, it does not subvert the superhero genre but carefully stays inside of it, even tying to the Avengers, even though commanding ants with gadgets is kinda cool. The movie did not have the strongest plot though, with the typical ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" who worked on a government project, and it could have been more developed. For instance, at one point Michael Douglas breaks out of the lab with a big tank, and the helicopter with Corey Stoll and his henchmen.

The film follows Scott Lang/Ant-Man, after being released from prison, Scott try's to put his thieving days behind him and go straight to become a better father for his daughter Cassie. When he starts to get no where near where he needs to be, he is recruited by Hank Pym who is forced out of his own company by his old assistant Darren Cross/Yellowjacket. When Cross starts to discover his own shrinking technology that could put the world in danger, Hank and his daughter Hope van Dyne, train Scott to be the Ant-Man and steal the technology from Cross before it's too late. First off, this is unlike any superhero story that has been told before in the MCU. It brings us a character that has not always been as honest and was never meant to be a hero, but it brings us a character that we all look up to by the very end. Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-Man was born to play this role. Michael Douglas as Hank Pym was perfect casting. Corey Stroll as Darren Cross/Yellowjacket was great as well.

","Another Marvel Studios movie has arrived to us with a promise as daring as Guardians of the Galaxy was the previous year; Ant-Man. From the very first moment of the movie you can sense the intense speed you'll be submerged into.

In fact, the development of the characters is very simple and basic, it was all just so expected.

Most comic book movies (Like the recent Avengers film) are fun but eventually devolve into formulaic beat 'em up smack downs between the good guys and the villain. And while there is a villain fight at the end, the action-filled finale is inventive and fun, taking advantage of the shrinking and growing powers.

","First of all I would like to say that I was one of the many people who thought that this film would not turn out well due to all of the problems and changes that happened during pre and post production. When the news broke that director Edgar Wright left the project and parted ways with Marvel, I was extremely worried about how this movie would turn out . I've always been a huge fan of his films and I consider him to be one of the most innovative and creative directors in the business but the bottom line is that he refused to tie his Antman film with the grander Marvel Cinematic Universe and he spent ten years developing the movie with no results. Anyways I truly think Peyton Reed knocked this movie out of the park. Paul Rudd was awesome as Scott Lang and the entire supporting cast was great. There was just the right amount of humor and the pacing and editing was top notch. The movie never drags and the special effects and action sequences were unbelievable cool. The best part of the film is seeing how Antmans powers work and the micro-verse he inhabits while he's in his shrinking form. I think Marvel really did a fantastic job and I can't wait to see the next installment in the Antman franchise.

","This movie was fun to watch. It's not the most original story, it's not the most interesting origin story, the character development was satisfactory, and its overall theme is a pretty common one seen in lots of other movies. Still, I had a good time watching it. It had a clever script that brought multiple instances of humor and gave the film an overall lighter mood than most Marvel movies. And like any Marvel origin movie, it gives viewers some nice action scenes (especially when Ant-Man is working with his team of ants as a tiny man) and an interesting look at how the protagonist transforms into a unique fighter of crime. The cast is fine. Paul Rudd does a good job portraying as Scott/Ant-Man, veteran Michael Douglas does well as the watchful and caring mentor in the story, and Evangeline Lilly fits her role perfectly as a serious, determined, and troubled character. The only flaw in the cast is Corey Stoll as the main villain, who can't really be taken too seriously in the story.

","Ant-man is a comedy action hybrid. The subject matter is not promising but it actually delivers a thoroughly captivating experience. Everything about this film is enjoyable: from the humour to Paul Rudd's portrayal of Scott Lang kicking butt! The movie reworks Ant-man's origin slightly, but not so much that people's dreams are destroyed. The story of the film is extremely entertaining taking aspects of the story from Iron Man. This is not something that hindered the movie however, as the performances of Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lilly are highly absorbing. The screen presence of each actor really breathes life into each of the characters. Corey Stoll's portrayal of Darren Cross is interesting, although compared to the rest of the acting it is somewhat forgettable. Special effects are very good, and the minimizing scenes are convincing. There are many nods to other franchises throughout the film, and I have no doubt that Ant- Man will be starring alongside the Avengers soon.

","Have we seen a Marvel heist movie? No, we have not. But then out of the blue, BAM! There we go! We now have Ant-Man, the best heist movie in all time! The plot follows Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) as he is introduced as this badass burglar who jacked a couple of houses and got locked behind bars. (Paul Rudd was basically himself in this movie). So we are then introduced to Cassie Lang (Abby Ryder Fortson) who is the cute daughter of Scott. Cassie is an important character in this movie as she is basically the moral support of Scott. Scott then is informed by a huge score which Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) intentionally leaked out to sources. Scott breaks in using smart mechanics and finds that there is only a suit. Scott puts it on and tests it out, he is then frightened as the suit suddenly shrinks and he hears Hank's voice. Hank then guides Scott as he trains to adapt to the suit. After rough turns and some training, they are ready to take on Yellow Jacket (Corey Stoll). After a massive battle they defeat Yellow Jacket, and Scott makes out with Hank's daughter. This movie is smart and witty, it makes Age of Ultron go to shame. If I had a bunch of money, I would invest it on making a sequel to this movie.

","I watched this movie on it's opening, and I have to say, I wasn't disappointed in the least!! While it is similar to the Marvel origin movies before it, it takes an unique approach to the characters. The mentor/pupil relationship between Hank Pym/Scott Lang is a refreshing new addition to the series, along with Hank Pym's own relationships with his family. The chemistry between the three main characters is stunning, and the acting is spot- on, you'll never feel like you're simply watching an origin story. The new enemy of the series may not seem so unique on the surface (business man gone wrong), but Corey Stoll does a magnificent job in setting himself apart from the other villains of the series. Paul Radd's Scott Lang is also a great addition to the already great cast of the Avengers. He does a great job of not only making Scott Lang a very relate-able character, but you end up rooting for him the entire movie, even against some wonderful characters. The amount of humor he adds to the story feels well-paced and timed, never making the audience feel like the jokes are out of place or unnecessary. Ant-Man's unique powers are also a nice addition compared to what was seen before, his abilities to control ants and shrink really set it apart and not making you feel like it's just a battle of ""who's stronger."" Lastly, the fact it's a heist film in soul also adds much to story. It allows the character to understand and grow as the hero, while also allowing character development and drama that just ends up making you very invested in what's going on, while feeling well-paced. While still being a superhero Marvel film (so there's not as much worry in wondering if he will complete the job from the beginning), it endeavors to pull away from some hero stereotypes, and this is especially true near the end when the heist begins to start. I personally really loved the film, and think it's among Marvel's best. Much like Winter Solider, which had elements of a spy drama, it really sets itself apart from what we've seen, and reminds us that these movies still have much to offer us.",/review/rw3282825/?ref_=tt_urv,Ant-Man_(2015

The film follows Scott Lang on his journey from thief to avenger as he meets Dr. Hank Pym a scientist who is responsible for the creation of the Pym Particle, a substance capable of altering the distance between atoms to shirk and grow things while retaining their mass. An evil scientist named Dr. Darren Cross wants to harness the Pym Particle in order to make miniature soldiers capable of taking down enemies. Of course Hank Pym doesn't like the idea so recruits Lang to take Down Cross. The film follows the same blue prints as most other Marvel films however it's not a stale formula and if it ain't broke don't fix it.

Kudos to Marvel for banking on one of their riskiest projects yet, but Ant-Man still falls prey to the studio's formulaic trappings and – aside from those exhilarating shrinking scenes – feels like a remix of the first Iron Man, Ocean's Eleven and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.

792,17 July 2015,sticks901,8," Ant-Man Movie Review: Comedians do make good Super-Heroes
","Well, Marvel did it again. They took a lesser known super-hero with a strange premise and turned it into a really solid movie. Ant-Man isn't as strong as Guardians was last year, though that may be my love of space adventures talking. It's comes close, and I'm wondering if Marvel will ever mess up again. They can; Captain America The First Avenger, Iron Man 3, and both Thor's, are about it though (down Marvel fan boys, back, back I say). Those are still enjoyable movies, they just aren't at the level of what Marvel has churned out recently. Ant-Man takes us on a great ride, and Paul Rudd hits a home run as the title character. The movie works because Rudd is a believable lovable loser. You want him to become the hero and save the day. We start out with Scott Lang, Paul Rudd, in prison getting ready to be released. He is trying to go straight, but gets roped into helping Hank Pym, played by Michael Douglas. What makes Ant-Man work is the comedy interlaced within the movie. Rudd has his handiwork all over the movie. There are only a few jokes that don't really work in the movie. If Ant-Man tried to be serious I don't think the movie would work. It's weird to think that a movie like this can exist in the same universe as the Daredevil TV series. They both are great, and really work within the larger framework. The technology in Ant-Man is great. Pym created the suit and the shrinking technology. The bad guy, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), is trying to reproduce the technology and sell to the highest bidder. It actually has some decent pseudo-science behind the concept. It is at least somewhat believable. You can definitely suspend your belief enough to think a man can shrink down to ant-size and control millions of ants. The ants are something I did not expect. They are my favorite part of the movie. I loved what Lang is able to do with them, and they add to the overall powers of Ant-Man. Ant-Man truly isn't as strong without actual ants to back him up. They play a big part in the movie and help take down Yellowjacket (Darren Cross). Where the movie misses slightly is in the villain. I really like Corey Stoll as an actor. I loved him in House of Cards, but his villain is just too over the top. It was hard to believe someone as unstable as him running a corporation. I also didn't really buy the interaction between Cross and Pym. I couldn't see them every really liking each other. It was hard to think Pym would have every trusted Cross. They try to explain this away, saying Cross has changed because of the Pym-particles affecting his brain. Pym didn't seem affected, they said he was but didn't go into how he was affected. However Pym was affected they did a poor job of explaining the risks to Lang. Will Lang have to hang up the suit because of some form of brain damage in several years? The other weird dynamic is Hank and his daughter Hope, played by Evangeline Lilly. I didn't quite buy into the emotional issues between her and him. They just seemed a little hokey (I really like that word). Lilly and Douglas are really good in their roles, they just didn't quite have the right chemistry together. Douglas and Lilly however both have great chemistry with Rudd. He plays off both of them well, and all three of them together are great on the screen. Without a doubt Rudd is the star of the movie, and he carries the load. You want him to succeed and become the hero. The plot is well done, and special effects are spectacular. I didn't feel like I was watching a something fake when I saw Ant-Man shrink down. There are some intense and funny scenes while he is shrunk, and it is what makes the movie so enjoyable. It feels like Lang becomes the Ant-Man quickly in the movie. It's a good origin story and didn't feel cliché. I had a great time viewing Ant-Man. It was funny, action packed, and has good characters. You can't go wrong with those three components in a movie. We now have to wait a year for our next Marvel movie. We have a bunch of TV shows to hold the fort until then. I'm looking forward to the next Netflix, show A.K.A Jessica Jones, if it's on the same level as Daredevil we are in for a treat.

Furthermore, it's important to appreciate the little-big things of this film, like how they made this movie so epic despite the size our protagonist was fighting in. The effects made you REALLY involved, whether from Scott's perspective, or from an onlooker looking onto Scott's small form. Overall, AntMan truly is a joy to watch-great action, great humor. Is it Avengers level? Of COURSE NOT because quite frankly, nothing ever is or will be Avengers level in the MCU, so it's not fair to compare individual films to such an impractical goal.

We can say he was a hero for his daughter. On the other, the amusingly peculiar thing in this movie is the act of Michael Pena, he was totally a dope. I've never seen this part of him (maybe cause I've not seen much of his movies). He is the only guy who's gonna crack you up.

","Okay, I'm a little biased because I've always loved Ant-Man (and the Wasp, but we're not there yet. It's fine), but y'all. This movie is genuinely fiiiine. Please consider:
1. Michael Peña and the rest of the crew are genuinely decently funny
2. Paul Rudd is doing his best and his best is genuinely touching sometimes
3. Evangeline Lilly hot & buff (& sad, find her mom pls)
4. Michael Douglas is... probably trying his best too, could do better though
5. I love Cassie Lang and you can quote me on that
6. The Michael Peña-narrated scenes are genuinely some of the funniest things I've ever seen
7. Tardigrades! Please bring them back in the next movie
8. Ant puns restricted to ant names. Acceptable. Rip Antoni.
9. Far fewer plot holes than average Marvel movie. Damn good heist movie too
10. One star off for sheep jelly and the fact that he had that tank on a key chain despite the fact that it would still weigh as much as a tank
11. Clever use of shrinking abilities to mix up the action scenes in the movie from what we're used to. Excellent job on that
12. Ant training montage. Very good. This pleases us

","One might shy away from this movie due to Ant-Man not being a well known or beloved marvel character ,but after watching this movie, I can tell you that would be a huge mistake. The film is packed with action that enthrall the viewer from the start to the end. The action is coupled with masterful CGI that does not take away from the overall feel of the movie. In addition to the action the brilliant cast brings lighthearted comedy throughout the movie which acts as a much needed break from the action. For a character that is not widely known by the general crowd of average movie-goers, the movie does an excellent job of character building. One can begin to understand the history of each character and see them grow as a person as the movie progresses.

","The Ant-Man movie was very well rounded. It had a little bit of everything. It's hard to make origin stories exciting, but Marvel seemed to pull it off without a hitch. The best way for movies like these, is when the casting director picks an actor from a different genre. Then, when the actor steps out of their element, and nails the role, everyone benefits. This movie was given a lot of criticism due director change and an relatively unknown comic book character. Any character, as long as you have a good story, actor, director, will come into its own. You don't need big names or big budgets, just talented and committed individuals. Ant-Man arrived in comic books in the 60s, founding members of the Avengers, but always seemed to be a background character. Background characters can be just as interesting or as exciting as the main character. It can be aggravating for a fan when everything isn't included or something is altered in a movie. You just can't fifty plus years of information in a two hour movie and please everyone. I believe Marvel would profit to make an Ant-Man 2, as long as they cast a new and unique villain to challenge this new media hero.",/review/rw3282825/?ref_=tt_urv,Ant-Man_(2015

","Alright. Ant-Man... Excited? .. nah, not really.. I am a huge super hero/sci-fi fan, I love these kind of movies because they feed my vivid imagination. I've seen most of the superhero movies, lately and even the older ones and the shitty ones. Right now with all the Avengers/Captain America mania the Ant-Man was quite bold to try to compete with those guys. When I saw the trailer I wasn't really excited. I thought ""yea..I will probably go see it, but Ant-Man is meh.."" I'm sure many people thought the same thing. The trailer itself is a little corny and maybe the whole movie is. But it is fun. I didn't think I would say that before I went to see it, but it really is. First of all I don't really like Paul Rudd, I still see him in F*R*I*E*N*D*S and to me he will always be that guy. However in this movie he does a really good job and I liked him! Michael Douglas as well. I didn't really like E.Lily that much but that's maybe because of her stupid wig and the fact that she just looked like a milf. The whole movie is really entertaining, there are some LOL moments when I really bursted into laughter and there's also some great lines. If you can't decide then give it a chance, you won't regret it. On the downside the movie is kinda for kids yea.. There's cute ants and not really much of any violence. A few fights and miniature explosions but that's it. There is also absolutely no suspense, which was a little disappointing. Throughout the whole movie you will not be tense or fear for someone's life. I mean of course every movie is the same, for a little while the bad guy beats the hero but the hero wins in the end.

","Overall this is one probably one of the best films of the year so far. Ant-man is a refreshing look on the avengers and has a new interesting tone that we have not seen before in a marvel film with the plot revolving around a heist to stop Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) from releasing his interpretation of Hank Pyms (Michael Douglas) ant-man. Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is recruited to be the new ant-man as Pym cannot continue being the hero following a tragic incident with his late wife forced him to stop. Michael Peña shines as one of Scott's friends who helps with the heist. Evangeline Lilly is a disappointment but has the potential to be a lot better after getting with Lang at the end and becoming the wasp. This heartwarming take on the comic (which I also love) is a nice take on the aftermath of the events on age of ultron. The only criticism I have is yellow-jacket as he is a very generic villain who resembles the first Iron mans villain and does not have much back-story and is not particularly threatening. The main thing I love about this film is the references: when talking about other superheroes they reference Spider-Man, when Lang says that they should call the avengers Hank Pym replies with no they'll just send a city into the sky and Antman has a fantastic fight with Falcon (Anthony Mackie) who also shows up looking for Scott at other points and is in the post-credit scene. This is a fantastic film and I think is better than age of ultron because it is something so fresh and not just more of the same. It is a bit like Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) in a way but is still an amazing take on one of the first avengers. I would recommend this film 100%",/review/rw3282825/?ref_=tt_urv,Ant-Man_(2015

How did they? None of friends who went with me had even heard of Ant-man, and now they're all fans.",/review/rw3282825/?ref_=tt_urv,Ant-Man_(2015

","I like how the movie evolves around a father who wants to become the hero his daughter already thinks he is. What I don't like and what broke my heart at the end of the movie is how Ant-man forgets his friend Anthony who was with him till the last breath of his life. We all know that Scott Lang became the Ant-man to win his daughter. I'm pretty sure when Ant-man tells his daughter Cassie about his adventure (where he will have to mention about Anthony), Cassie will ask what happened to Anthony. What is he going to tell her? I don't think a true hero would forget his friends like Ant-man did. Just saying! And I found Ant-man a bit silly at times trying to be funny, which kind of doesn't suit the ""Marvel"" standards. That's only my personal opinion. After all it's a cool movie the whole whole family can enjoy together!",/review/rw3282825/?ref_=tt_urv,Ant-Man_(2015
