There were some really funny moments in this. Rudd was superb and his trio of friends great. I also really like Douglas. Lilly makes a great wasp but my only criticism really was that it really championed her as being the capable hero and Ant Man's Rudd as being a bit of a loser and buffoon. Not cool.

Finally the MCU makes one a lead, and half the title of a movie. Badass, with a heart, and a great partner). Lang(Rudd, the everyman, a great father) wants to help them out, but is worried about his house arrest following the events of Civil War. So they have to hide him from the FBI. At least his ex and her fiance now love him like his daughter does. I guess they're passionately Team Cap? I mean, last we saw them, they were like, ""just don't break the law and lose time with your little girl again"". If they asked ""did you even think about Cassie when called to Germany?"", they can't have been very happy with the answer that he said ""I'd be working outside the law? A wanted man? what else is new?"". I figure it was considered a funny contrast to the first one. I agree, and I'd add heart-warming. I get if some hate it, though. It is inconsistent. Anyway. To Ghost(John-Kamen, compelling, with a tragic backstory, dangerous, willing to go to extreme lengths to save herself from pain and dying soon), it's a way to stabilize her from the phasing that she can barely control, and continues to take a toll on her, physically and emotionally. And to Sonny(Goggins, always worth watching), it's a way to get rich by having access to something a lot would love to use, and no one else can control. His presence means there are several groups of armed men for the heroes to defeat. That's an element that almost always improves these flicks. These are more antagonists than villains. Basically, all three(well, the feds just want to catch them in the act) of these individuals and groups try to get, from the good guys, the vehicle and tunnel that allows accessing this mysterious dimension.",/review/rw4348571/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_2018

","""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is just as entertaining and sensational as its silly, CGI-laden origins predecessor ""Ant-Man."" For the record, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" picks up sometime after ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016), so the sequel fits neatly into the Marvel Cinematic Universe timeline. The impressive thing about ""Bring It On"" director Peyton Reed's sequel is the chemistry as well as the charisma that the ensemble cast generates as events alternate between larger-than-life and smaller-than-life. At times, this amusing, lightweight, action-packed epic turns into a good-natured, slap-happy, screwball comedy. No, the world doesn't teeter on the brink of disaster. No, the most despicable supernatural dastard in the galaxy-Thanos-hasn't come to destroy Earth. Nothing so monstrous as that happens in this movie! This suspenseful, often hilarious saga confines itself largely to domestic issues. The FBI has Scott Lang, a.k.a. Ant-Man, (Paul Rudd of ""Wanderlust"") under house arrest for having violated of the Sokovia Accords during his illegal escapades in Vienna with Captain America against the Avengers. Meanwhile, Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas of ""Wall Street"") and his daughter Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly of ""Real Steel""), still dodging the FBI, struggle to recover Hank's long, lost-in-limbo wife, Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer of ""Batman Returns""), from the sub-atomic oblivion of the Quantum Realm. Ant-Man's Hispanic pal Luis (Michael Peña of ""Chips"") is still up to his ridiculous antics, spinning those long-winded tales, where everybody speaks with his voice in spite of visually being themselves!

","Having run afoul of the law in his latest adventure as Ant-Man, ""Scott Lang"" (Paul Rudd) has been confined to house arrest and in order to prevent an even longer sentence from being imposed upon him must stay there while being electronically monitored at all times. However, when his previous mentor ""Dr. Hank Pym"" (Michael Douglas) requests his assistance to help rescue his wife ""Janet Van Dyne"" (Michelle Pfeiffer) from the quantum realm, Scott feels obligated to help. Also involved in the rescue operation is Dr. Pym's daughter ""Hope Van Dyne"" (Evangeline Lilly) who just happens to be a super-hero known as the Wasp. But as difficult as this assignment what none of them realize is that there are two other groups with different agendas who plan on stopping them-and both have various resources at their disposal to accomplish their goals. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an enjoyable ""Super-hero movie"" which had decent amounts of humor and good special effects to compliment the action. I especially liked the character ""Luis"" (Michael Pena) who was absolutely hilarious.

Wouldn't it be more likely that--relieved of the stress of being big in a macro (or macaroni) sense--the original Wasp would have barely aged a day by the time her hubby belated reunites with her? What chick wouldn't fantasize about a world in which she's only on the hook for giving the best micro-seconds of her life to the groom? Similarly, what is it that has been the downfall of such famous Americans as Ted Bundy, Ed Gein, and Scott Peterson? The lack of miniaturization skills, of course.

The CGI effects were on point, as well as the crash scenes, driving scenes etc. It's very hard to get that effect of being small and making it look real but they did it. Great storyline and acting all around. I'm not sure why the bad reviews. Trolls maybe? Make sure to see it, and don't let the few mad reviews sway your decision.

","Honestly, I really should penalise this movie, or at least the MCU in general, for getting rid of Edgar Wright from the previous instalment of Ant-man. Then again, I suspect that there is something about working for MCU that a self-styled director like Wright would end up clashing with. In fact, sometimes I feel that with the MCU the director really doesn't have as much creative control over a movie as they would have in their own works, which is probably why Wright in the end didn't make a good fit. However, with that off my chest, I guess I'll just judge the movie based on, well, the movie as opposed to the background shenanigans.
 Yeah, this film was actually pretty cool, and certainly provides a few answers to some questions that we had at the end of Infinity War, namely where the hell was Ant-man? Well, now we know - he was under house arrest, and through a court order he was not allowed to associate with any of the Avengers once his house detention had come to an end. It turns out that out of everybody that was involved in the shenanigans at Leipzig Airport, it seems as if he was the only one that actually got arrested (though once again the wear-a-bouts of Hawkeye is still a mystery).
 The other thing is that while there are bad guys in the film, in regards to the actual plot they are really only a side show - there are much more important things in the minds of our protagonists, particularly Scott, who just wants to get over his current incarceration and once again spend time with his daughter. However, it seems as if Hank Pym and his daughter have other ideas (though he isn't allowed to actually have any contact with them either, and further they also happen to be on the run from the police).
 Remember how in the previous film Scott went into the quantum realm and returned? Well, that plays a very big role in this film, but then again I probably shouldn't be all that surprised considering we are talking about people who can shrink themselves at will (and also grow pretty big, though that has problems in and of itself). Also, remember that at the end of the previous film Hank revealed a new suit for his daughter to wear. Well, that is why we now have the Wasp appearing in this film, though at first the relationship does tend to be a little strained, with the whole Leipzig thing and all that.
 Yeah, I thought the film was actually pretty good, but then again the MCU certainly does seem to be able to produce some pretty polished films these days. Also, the whole bad guys really only being an obstacle to the actual goal as opposed to whose defeat is actually the end in itself also gives it a bit more of a polish than what you tend to get with many films. I guess the whole beat the bad guy and walk away happy does get a bit tiring after a while.",/review/rw4348571/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_2018

","If you want a friendly little movie to cheer you up, here it is. I can't help but to have a good time with an Ant-Man story. The character is sympathetic and pretty much a lighthearted everyday man who stumbles into excitement. It's designed to delight people with an optimistic, family-type vibe. I've seen some complaints saying that there's a lack of greater or darker stakes/consequences. I don't mind it in this particular series. The weight lies in the family dynamics. And also in the message that being a hero isn't always stopping bad guys, but helping your friends and family. Or I guess by simply saying that being there, showing support, is very important. A message that can also be picked up from films like ""The Incredibles"" or Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"". The difference would be that the actual action aspect never involves ""the end of the world"" or any big destruction like that. It's perfect that things lead up to a car chase in the streets with people changing sizes and jumping from vehicle to vehicle. There doesn't need to be a war or countless buildings collapsing.

","Unlike in most of the franchises where the third installment is the weakest, MCU happens to be consistent in making the second installment the weakest one, except for ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" (2014). ""Ant-Man and The Wasp"" is a continuation in the legacy. It was mostly vague, and almost a total crap. It doesn't try to be anything more than a filler. To be honest, it felt like a dumbed down version of ""25th Hour"" with a lighter tone featuring some superhero characters. It simply aims at being a movie with some little fun stuff but being disposable on the whole. Both of the major plotlines - one involving Ghost and the other involving Sonny Burch felt just like something that was there to help the plot go further. The characterization of Ghost and Burch have no depth in them. Burch is totally shallow and one dimensional and generic. Ghost has a little backstory, and isn't enough to get behind the character. The motives which drive both the plotlines are totally clichéd and thinly built. It felt as if they thought 'Ghost isn't a good villain, let's distract the viewers by giving them the other plotline'. This created an ""Iron Man 2"" level of multiple plotline mess - a little less interesting. Ant-Man is a sidekick in this movie. From someone who could bring about a well planned heist to a doofus - with no explanation. Giant Man plays into the story, but it's more for slapsticky purposes. Also, the original Wasp gets some powers in the Quantum Realm which are not even explained by this movie. Surely, it might be explained in future films, but it could've easily done that. Lawrence Fishburne feels like a wasted talent in this movie. It seemed like a promising character, but turned out to be the same old ""good guy in the bad guy's side"" character. One good thing about this movie, besides the cast, is the deaging CGI. It looked awesome. To me, it felt like Michael Douglas from the 90s with just a different hair and almost similarly with others. Father-daughter dynamic between Scott and his daughter was likeable. To sum it up, I must say that it was way below my expectations. It's not that I have watched an impactful and emotionally craving ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and I wasn't in a mood to watch something so less impactful. I knew it wasn't going to be a spectacular as IW but neither did I expect it to be so much of a mediocrity. It's not that the aftermath of IW has holded this movie down. After a long time, it will develop the same legacy as that of ""Iron Man 2"", at best. I wonder how the same critics who panned ""Justice League"" (2017) for having a thin plot and creating a mess gave it a thumbs up. As someone who likes ""Ant-Man"" (2015) and considers it to be the most underappreciated MCU movie till date, its sequel was mediocre at best. I thought ""Black Panther"" was going to be the worst MCU movie of 2018, but I was wrong. It's ""Ant-Man and The Wasp"".",/review/rw4348571/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_2018

","How do you follow up the shocking gut-punch that is Avengers: Infinity War? With a lighthearted, standalone comedy like Ant-Man and the Wasp, naturally. Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) has always been an interesting character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He is one of the more absurd heroes, and yet Marvel found a way to make him appealing back in 2015. Paul Rudd is excellent as the character, and he brings something to the universe that nobody else really does. Ant-Man was a good film, and I liked it very much. I don't think it's one of Marvel's best, but it's a solid movie that I definitely enjoyed. So I've been looking forward to the sequel. With Evangeline Lily now suited up right alongside Rudd as the Wasp, I thought that this one had the potential to exceed the first film. I have to see Ant-Man again, but I do think I still like that one more than this new one. Ant-Man and the Wasp has a lot of great comedy and is immensely entertaining, though its storytelling is rather simplistic and can even come across as cheesy and cliched at times.

","Alright, i have seen quite a bit of negative reviews on here. but while reading through those reviews, i noted a couple things.
1) people don't understand that this is SUPPOSED to be a comedic movie. the reason why ""serious"" scenes are interrupted by some joke or punchline is because it's not supposed to keep the audience tense and on the edge of their seat. 
2) people don't understand the heart of who ant-man is. he's not some valiant superhero like captain america or thor who can knock out an opponent with one punch or flick of the wrist. he is first and foremost, a father. what drives him is his relationship with his daughter, so yes, a lot of the film is centered around that. but i think this adds a special element to the film that most other superhero movies do not have. scott has a lot to lose and a lot to motivate him, other than just ""being a hero and saving the day."" he has a family. scott is also not a professional superhero. yes, he is ant-man and has experience with the suit, however, he does not have the resources of shield or tony stark at his disposal so he cannot simulate advanced training missions and whatnot all the time. in fact, he is under house arrest, so he can't do anything superhero related anyway. and that is why scott is dependent on other people and why it is not called ""ant man 2"" but ""ant man and the wasp."" hope van dyne plays a key role in this film, not just acting as a love interest. she is a hero in her own right and is more experienced than scott.
3) the negative reviews forget about the gripping and thrilling action sequences in this film. it is a marvel movie after all and lives up to its name with all the fight scenes and car chases and special effects. i think all the characters in this movie were key to the plot, it was engaging, and a very fun movie. i enjoyed every minute of it.",/review/rw4348571/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_2018

","Marvel Comics' Ant-Man's powers consist of both growing and shrinking to heights outside of the norms of nature. Ant-Man and the Wasp, the sequel to the 2015 superhero-comedy hit and the 19th picture in the unstoppable MCU, emulates its character's abilities. In its humor and clearly focused stakes, it towers above its Avenger cohorts. In its series import and villain menace, it's in danger of being stepped on. In whole, this sci-fi-actioner sits lightly alongside its brethren with the ease of Paul Rudd's charm.
We pickup Scott Lang's story years after he was placed under house arrest for breaking his parole in the airport fight in Civil War. Having betrayed the secretive trust of Lily and Douglas's characters, he is trying to make amends by helping them retrieve what they need to re-enter the quantum zone and save their mother / wife. Because of the breezy tone and familiar plotting, there isn't much actual tension in any of the numerous conflicts. Instead, the fun is in the comedic action and character interplay, with Pena continuing his Ant-Man streak of stealing every hilarious scene he's in.
In comparison to 2015's Ant-Man, this is funnier, bigger and better, with director Reed having a much stronger handle on the material than when he was given the unenviable job of taking over from Edgar Wright (Baby Driver, Hot Fuzz) 3 years ago. Really though, there's not much else to talk about here.

","This is posted after my second watching, but my rating stands. Here is my review after seeing it the day of its release:
This will be a minority opinion (of the 8 reviews posted here on Trakt immediatley after the premiere I was the only one who feels this way - the other rating ranges from 7 to 10 out of 10) but as I left the theatre I felt the whole movie was flat and didn't quite hit the mark. The humour seemed more miss than hit. The people around me seemed similarily unamused. During the whole movie there were only two guffaws from audience members at different moments, one from a child during a silly bit and the other from an adult male as a cynical response to a piece of dialogue. I should reveal that I am not a big Paul Rudd fan and found the first ANT-MAN uninspiring as well. Evangeline Lily (who's work I really do enjoy)'s character was at the forefront of this movie but her strength in expressing a depth of emotion (especially internal conflict) was thwarted by a script that didn't allow any depth beyond stoic determination and there didn't seem to be any reason for her character to be drawn to Rudd's Scott Lang. I thought Michael Douglas role and performance was a disaster. Walton Goggins' villain lacked any convincing motivation. However, Hannah John-Kamen (always a good actor) gave us a convincing portrayal as Ava Starr/Ghost. It's always good to see Michelle Pfeiffer (even for the 15 minutes she is in this movie). CGI was great. Adventure was pivotal. Sight gags abounded (as the last post-credit scene attests). I can see this movie appealing to: 1) people who liked the first movie, 2) Junior High males, and/or 3) Marvel Universe purists (by the way, there is a mid-credit and a post credit scene). Although I will always watch each new addition to the Marvel Universe whether in TV or Movie format, I can only give this film a 5 (meh) out of 10. {Superhero Action Adventure}",/review/rw4348571/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_2018

","These 120 minutes we got here are the second Ant-Man movie and the newest addition to the billion-$ grossing Marvel franchise. You read about the two protagonists in the title already and as Marvel has been doing a lot recently, they are adding superheroes left and right and this one is not just about Ant-Man anymore at the core of it all. Peyton Reed returns, he was also in charge of directing the first, but he is not one of the many writers working on this 2018 film we have here. But one of them is Paul Rudd, who of course plays the title character. From goofball comedies over idiot brother to leading a Marvel superhero franchise. Not too shabby for him. Good for him as I like him, here and in other stuff. He brings some known formulas here, but in general, this is not the typical Marvel movie. The main reason for that is that we do not have a global danger, or an antagonist who wants to destroy mankind or a big city or at least enslave everybody, but it's much more a personal story as Wasp's human form wants to find her mother again, who disappeared decades ago and with the help of Ant-Man (and his human form) and her father we get to witness how they move closer and further away from this achievement. The antagonists are also not that epic, or that evil you could say. They have motivations you can understand, but their approaches may not be right, at least in terms of the only evil character with superpowers. Then there is of course Walton Goggins' gang, who will be a delight to watch for everybody hopefully, not just fans of Justified. The truth serum running gag is just an absolute highlight we have here in this film from start to finish. And then you could say that the FBI or whoever was chasing Rudd's character and the scientists were also more clumsy antagonists than really enemies that could be taken seriously (same applies to Goggins, more of a nuisance than a threat). As for Rudd, I thought he was great fun to be honest. He had some really good comedic lines and it's nice to see him not take himself so seriously. Downey jr.'s and Cumberbatch's characters can learn a lot from him. The film's reference to technology and science is one that made this film look a bit similar at times to Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange movie, but yeah, Rudd is of course the far more gifted actor.",/review/rw4348571/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_2018

And to a certain degree you can blame the director and the writers, after reading a summary of the movie's development it seemed they have accepted their fate as MCU's official void-filler: the first came right after the highly successful Avengers: Age of Ultron, and now the sequel right after the insanely successful Avengers: Infinity War, which is now the fourth highest-grossing movie of all time.",/review/rw4348571/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_2018

","Every so often, Peyton Reed's Ant-Man and the Wasp manages to channel the same kind of lo-fi irreverence that made the original Ant-Man so memorable. To the new film's credit, those moments come regularly, welcome blasts of fresh air; to its detriment, they serve to remind us of a better movie that we could be watching - one actually built on that kind of cheeky spirit rather than merely utilizing it to distract us from a cumbersome, uninteresting plot.Reed's 2015 film, one of the unlikelier entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, dispensed with the typical heroics and focused on the humor inherent in its concept: A mopey, down-and-out thief winds up with the power to shrink to microscopic levels, whereupon he can ride insects and mind-meld with ants and even kick some occasional human ass. Reed also foregrounded the small-scale emotions of the movie's storyline. Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) was simply trying to get back into the good graces of his estranged family, especially his young daughter Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson); the added complication of him now becoming a not-very-good superhero was a force that threatened, sometimes hilariously, to disrupt everybody's lives even further.",/review/rw4348571/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_2018

The 'Ant Man and The Wasp' are a set; two hundred and fifty words per review. The movie offered pop corn and cool drinks like cola to be purchased with the movie ticket which brought a pleasant 'input' to a not so pleasant seating arrangement because this reviewer lead two others to get seats nearby because of the attention that was grasped by buying tickets and cola or 'Coca cola' with the show and standing and watching people come down through the elevators at the cinema hall. 
The two strangers who took seats beside me were aware that the seats had me by their side because they had brought 'Coca Cola'. Coca Cola is the drink that has 'Cocain' inside; little bit the sugar by twenty to a cup did not let it.

The stakes become increasingly larger for rom-coms, road trips, heists, police procedurals and war films.

This movie didn't feel like a movie. It was a filler for something they'll introduce in Avengers 4. Nothing stands out in this. Nothing relatable. Nothing noticeable. Nothing cool. The movie only has one dimensional action and characters. I could've thought of these action scenes in the comics I made when I was 9. And to go with it, the dialogue I made when I was 9 too. Just so cringy and choppy. Also the ""We must save ___."" It's a basic plot from 101 academy. And it's Wasp as the main hero. Who cares about this Antman fellow? Nah, it's the Wasp. With her basic action scenes! To save someone! Who would've ever thought of this original idea!? I like movies even if they have such overused plots only if they do it different. This says no. Even with the effort looking like it was none in this movie. I feel the aura inside me that this movie probably did have effort in it. In some interviews, the director sounded like he was invested in this Antman and Wasp story. I saw the movie, and I knew this guy tried to style his movie. Like he tried to so hard to be a god at directing like Edgar Wright. That did not work. When scenes in movies just try to so hard to be cool, it's cheesy and cringy. That's what this turned out to be. A cheesy thing. Cheesy action, dialogue like I said before.

","Coming only a few months after the intense behemoth that was Infinity War, the second Ant-Man instalment, and the 20th entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), serves as a much needed, light-hearted come down. It's not completely inconsequential-the movie's quantum realm potentially having big MCU ramifications (and stay during the end credits)-but the story of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd, entertaining as ever) reluctantly returning to a life of heroics after two years under house arrest is more diverting than essential. Where its strengths lie is in character; the elevation of Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), aka the Wasp, from love-interest sidekick to fully-fledged partner generates increased opportunities for witty repartee and interesting character decisions, not least revolving around Lang's desire to balance fatherhood with Avenging. Lilly also adds an additional level of badass-ery, outshining Rudd in the hand-to-hand combat and arguably given the lion's share of the 'hero shots'. A first act restaurant-set dust-up very quickly cements her fighting status at expert. The action set-pieces in general are delivered with the expected level of whimsy, a lengthy car chase throughout the hilly streets of San Fran offering some amusing shrinking moments complete with hot-wheels sound effects. Unfortunately the tongue-in-cheek tone doesn't cover for all flaws, chief among them Walter Goggins' embarrassingly one-dimensional black-market baddie who seems to have walked in direct from an episode of a cheesy 80s TV show. It lacks the scope and sheer awesomeness of other MCU outings, but with a winning lead duo (and another hilarious performance from Michael Pena as Lang's fast-talking ex-con pal Luis), Ant-Man and the Wasp is a jovial romp that'll put a smile on your face.",/review/rw4348571/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_2018

","The Ant-Man film was a surprise gem of Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase 2, taking one of the sillier and least likely comic book heroes and making him compelling and real in a film with genuine heart and loads of laughs. This Phase 3 outing is more of the same. It's not quite as good as the original, perhaps because expectations are now higher, but Paul Rudd puts on another excellent performance as lovable rogue Scott Lang/Ant-Man, rejoined by a cast of memorable characters from his ex-con cronies Luis and co, to his predecessor as Ant-Man Hank Pym and his daughter Hope who now has a suit of her own and some kick-ass fighting moves as the Wasp. There's also a welcome return of Scott's daughter Cassie and his ex-wife and her new husband, role-modelling a healthy, loving, modern extended family.

","Ant-Man and the Wasp (in Brazil and Portugal, Homem-Formiga e a Vespa) is a 2018 US film based on Marvel Comics characters Scott Lang / Ant-Man and Hope van Dyne / Vespa. Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, being the sequel to Ant Man, 2015, and the 20th film in the Marvel Cinematographic Universe. Directed by Peyton Reed and written by Paul Rudd with the teams of Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers and Andrew Barrer and Gabriel Ferrari, it stars Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Bobby Cannavale, Michael Peña, Tip ""T.I."" Harris, Judy Greer, David Dastmalchian, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Laurence Fishburne, Hannah John-Kamen, Randall Park and Walton Goggins. In Ant-Man and the Wasp, Lang partners with van Dyne to embark on a new Pym mission. The film has the familiar theme, humor and various possibilities involving the objects and the people themselves. However the main goal is to make you laugh: not by chance, the core involving Luis and his huge team gets more space with extended jokes. The script is incomplete and its inability to give any inconsistency to the story itself. The quantum kingdom has beautiful scenes almost the same as Doctor Strange; despite being more exploited by the mysterious tone than proper. In the first scene pro-credits reveal little.

","After the fate-of-the-universe shenanigans of Avengers: Infinity War just three months ago (two months if you live in a country where football isn't that popular), Marvel's twentieth entry into their unstoppable cinematic universe, or MCU, understandably plays the role of palette-cleanser. Infinity War included every Marvel superhero so far, except Hawkeye, and while we still await a solo outing for nobody's favourite Avenger, Ant-Man - who was also absent from the cosmic battle against Thanos - is back for a sequel. The first Ant-Man somehow survived the loss of director Edgar Wright and emerged as a lighter, smaller-scale branch of the ever-expanding MCU. It may have followed the formula of Iron Man's origin very closely, but it was incredibly inventive when its hero suited-up and scaled-down to dodge everything from huge feet pounding a dancefloor, a hungry rat, or the sight of his giant best friend naked. Without the comforts of the origin story however, Ant-Man and the Wasp and returning director Peyton Reed are at a loss which direction to go, and end up throwing multiple storylines at the wall to see what sticks.

369,11 February 2021,hoernkeem,7," Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018, Peyton Reed) Wasp finally gets headline billing in a solid follow up to the original with important connective tissue to the large MCU as a whole
","Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018, Peyton Reed)
After the colossal events that were 'Black Panther' and 'Infinity War' the entire world can breathe a collective sigh of relief as Marvel returns to more modest, yet no less compelling fare, in the follow up to 2015's 'Ant-Man' and I think in many ways this film actually surpasses that one while keeping the same understated superhero vibe. This is a very self contained movie until the very end featuring no character outside of the Ant-Man storyline. The movie starts as Scott Lang is under house arrest, apparently the only Avenger to have real world repercussions due to the events of 'Civil War'. His aiding of Captain America made not only him a fugitive but the Van Dyne's as well who now apparently hate him, but of course that cannot hold and the action picks up when Scott gets a vision of/from the original Wasp, Janet Van Dyne, possibly still alive. This spurs the plot along as the Van Dynes and Scott attempt to pinpoint and save her while at the same time dodging various bad guys. The villains are a weak point here. Walton Goggins shows up as some black market mover and shaker but doesn't ever present himself as a villain really worth taking seriously. The other primary enemy is a mysterious shrouded figure who has some legit fighting skills and can phase. She is known as Ghost, but transitions into more of a sympathetic character as her story is revealed. Randall Park shows up as a gung-ho FBI agent, and while applaud his appearance I think he falls into the realm of caricature and is played too much for laughs as he is obsessively attempting to bring down Scott Lang like an odd Wile-E-Coyote to Lang's Roadrunner. Rudd's cohorts from the first film, who are led by Michael Pena, are now all running a private security business. As a counterpoint to Park they are the same humorous characters but they feel a little more genuine and lived in this time around. Just like the first film I love the sad sack humor that Rudd brings to Lang and it forms a nice counterpoint to Evangeline Lilly's Wasp who is smart, capable and an all around bad ass. It is nice to see her ditch the severe hairstyle of the last film for a much more natural, endearing look here. Her elevation to title character and all the scenes that go with it are about the best thing in the movie. The search for the original Wasp is worthy storyline here and this film amounts to a fun action comedy skewing away from the darker road Marvel has recently been trodding down. This film doesn't carry that weight but its lightness feels like a breath of fresh air in the MCU. And the post credit scene is easy predict a mile away, but it brings their little insular story right back home into the larger framework that is the MCU.

And while Ant-Man was a terribly good film in any way, the fact that his film excels it completely is a welcome surprise.
The idea behind some scenes are hilarious (see: Truth Serum) and it manages to add Lawrence Fishburne to the MCU, it doesn't overuse Michael Pena, and it allows Evangeline Lily to kick ass without seeming to be cloying or misguided like some other superhero films with strong female characters.
I laughed a lot, some of the gags and some of Rudd's line readings had me in absolute stitches. Peyton's chops as a comedy director are finally fully swinging here and Dante Spinotti manages to make every plain and every day setting feel rich and sumptuous alongside the effortlessly superb production design.
Ant-Man and The Wasp, despite the titular Wasp now, actually feels like Paul Rudd has some breathing room and focus this time and although it never seems particularly expensive, it never strains against its budget like some other CGI heavy Marvel entries.

","Good timing by Marvel to follow up Infinity War with a much lighter film of almost no consequence; and this is what Ant-Man 2 is and it is fine for it. The plot sees Scott stuck in house arrest, but when he has a strange vison linking him to the long-lost wife of scientist Hank Pym, it draws him back into the world of Ant-Man to find her. Meanwhile a mystery figure also seeks her for darker reasons. As a plot it is perfectly fine; it rarely makes sense if you linger too long on any one part of it, but mostly it does the trick and keeps things moving along - pausing only to let a serious bit happen.",/review/rw4348571/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_2018

","The first movie in the continuing Marvel Universe was good fun and did reasonably well at the box office, a sequel was probably expected, and I hoped that it could be even better, directed by Peyton Reed (Bring It On, Down with Love, The Break-Up, Yes Man). Basically in 1987, Janet Van Dyne aka the Wasp (Michelle Pfeiffer) shrank between the molecules of a Soviet nuclear missile, it was disabled, but she became trapped in the sub-atomic quantum realm, her husband Dr. Hank Pym aka the original Ant-Man (Michael Douglas) raised their daughter Hope, believing that Janet is dead. Years later, former criminal Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has taken the mantle to become Ant-Man, but since secretly helping Captain America during the skirmish between the Avengers, he is under house arrest, while Pym and Hope (Lost's Evangeline Lilly) are in hiding and have cut ties with Scott. Two years on, Scott has a realistic dream about the quantum realm, and he sees Janet, with whom he is quantumly entangled, he gives Pym a call to tell him about it. Hope kidnaps Scott, leaving a decoy, a giant ant, to mimic Scott's movements, so as not to arouse the suspicion of the FBI and agent Jimmy Woo (Randall Park). Seeing the dream as a message and a confirmation that Janet is alive, Pym and Hope work to create a tunnel stable enough to launch a vehicle into the quantum realm and rescue Janet. There is one part required to complete the tunnel, Hope arranges to meet black market dealer Sonny Burch (Walton Goggins) to buy it, but he knows the potential profit that could be earned from Pym and Hope's research. Burch double-crosses them, Hope, as the Wasp, fights him and his men off, until she is attacked by a quantumly unstable masked woman, Scott, as Ant-Man tries to help fight off this ""ghost"", but she escapes with Pym's portable lab. Pym reluctantly visits his estranged former partner Dr. Bill Foster (Laurence Fishburne) who helps them locate the lab. The ghost restrains Scott, Hope, and Pym when they arrive, she reveals herself to be Ava Starr (Hannah John-Kamen), her father Elihas (Michael Cerveris), another former partner of Pym's, accidentally killed himself during a quantum experiment, which resulted in Ava's unstable state. Foster reveals that he has been helping Ava, they are planning to cure her, using Janet's quantum energy, Pym refuses to help them, believing that this will kill Janet, the trio manage to escape. With the needed part, the tunnel is now stable, Pym and Hope are able to contact Janet, who through Scott communicates her precise location, but warns that they only have two hours before the unstable nature of the realm separates them for a century. Burch learns their location from Scott's business partners Luis (Crash's Michael Peña), Dave (Tip ""T.I."" Harris), and Kurt (David Dastmalchian), and informs a contact at the FBI. Luis warns Scott, who rushes home before Woo can see him breaking his house arrest, leaving Pym and Hope to be arrested, and for their lab to be taken by Ava. Scott is soon able to help Pym and Hope escape custody, and they find the lab. Pym decides to take the risk to enter the quantum realm, Scott and Hope distract Ava while he does so, but the pair also have to fight Burch and his men. Luis, Dave, and Kurt help apprehend Burch, allowing Pym to successfully find Janet, and Scott and Hope manage to stop Ava before she can take Janet's energy. Pym and Janet safely return from the quantum realm, and Janet voluntarily gifts some of her energy to Ava to temporarily stabilise her. Scott returns home, in time for a now suspicious Woo to release him at the end of his house arrest, while Ava and Foster go into hiding. In the mid-credits sequence, Pym, Hope, and Janet send Scott into the quantum realm to harvest quantum energy to continue helping Ava, but before they can bring Scott back, Pym, Hope, and Janet all disintegrate (the ending of Avengers: Infinity War), leaving Scott drifting. Also starring Bobby Cannavale as Jim Paxton, Judy Greer as Maggie, Abby Ryder Fortson as Cassie and Stan Lee as Shrunken Car Man. Rudd is much more convincing this time as the leading hero with deadpan quips, Lilly gets more time on screen as the second hero of the piece, Douglas remains good as the wise scientist, Pfeiffer is good but limited for obvious reasons, and the supporting cast are all good too. The story is more though-out, much slicker and wittier than perhaps previously, and the special effects are even better, much more shrinking and growing this time, and fantastic fast-paced chase and fight sequences, and funny stuff as well, a really fun superhero action adventure.

","'Ant-Man And The Wasp (2018)' feels like a feature that knows exactly what it wants to be - a smaller, more personal superhero film with a lighter tone and an appropriate focus on fast-paced fun. It seems to know exactly how to be it, too, perhaps even more so than the first. Almost every aspect of its production confidently comes together to form an experience totally committed to being the best version of itself it can possibly be. It's a perfect counter-point to the much heavier, though more affecting, 'Avengers: Infinity War (2018)' - which was released the same year. The picture is an incredibly fun time that doesn't hang about for a second. It thankfully keeps a keen focus on its characters - who are, admittedly, slightly less rounded than before - and brings some occasionally genuinely funny but always refreshingly charming and character-driven comedy to the forefront. The narrative tries some interesting things within its limited scope and only makes a couple of minor - and ultimately excusable - missteps along the way. All of this makes it perhaps even better - certainly in terms of enjoyment - than its predecessor, even if it doesn't quite reach the heights of the 'MCU' at large. 8/10",/review/rw4348571/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_2018

Some fresh faces are introduced to the Marvel Universe as well in the form of Lawrence Fishburne, Walton Goggins, and most importantly Hannah John-Kamen as by far the most unique villain the MCU has given us (yes, finally another female villain!), which is especially surprising and refreshing after Corey Stoll's more stereotypical run as the Yellowjacket. Director Peyton Reed delivers a screenplay that loves to dial the intensity all the way up to eleven, yet still thankfully has plenty of room for laughs (like what is probably Stan Lee's funniest cameo yet) in-between a few good edge-of-your-seat moments that will have you peeking between your fingers to make sure everyone's still alright.

436,1 February 2019,jamesrupert2014,5," Juvenile entry into the MCU franchise
","Having returned from the quantum realm, Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) is channeling Janet van Dyne (the original Wasp, Michelle Pfeiffer) who was lost in the sub-atomic limbo decades earlier. Hank Pym (the original Antman, Michael Douglas) and his daughter Hope van Dyne (the new Wasp, Evangeline Lilly) want to use the info embedded in Lang's brain to bring her out. Complicating matters are gangsters and a quantum-shifting 'Ghost', all of whom are out to steal Pym's technology (conveniently stored in a portable lab). The plot is loosely thrown together and doesn't really make much sense (but involves many BDMs, flashing lights, and techno-babble), and the film is played mostly for laughs, mostly. Humour is a very individual thing but unlike 'Guardians of the Galaxy' or 'Thor: Ragnarok', I found the constant 'comic banter' in this film banal, forced, and not particularly funny, which may be due to the lack of talking racoons, overly literal 'Destroyers', or po-faced deities. None of the characters in 'Antman and the Wasp' are particularly novel, interesting, or engaging and I found their interplay to be flat, repetitious and predictable. Like Bugs Bunny or Popeye cartoons, the physics in the MCU requires a great deal of suspension of disbelief, but the Antman franchise really pushes the boundaries, especially as the 'rules' seem to vary with storyline requirements (e.g. the effect of size change on the mass of the object). Lack of internal consistency is, to me, usually a sign of lazy or sloppy writing in fantasy or science fiction stories. Disney, not Thanos, is the ultimate power in the MCU and this film seems to be made for the studio's youthful target audiences: with lots of cloying daddy: daughter bonding, puerile barf jokes, goofy side-kicks, and silly sight gags. Being decades outside the Mouse's crosshairs, the movie wasn't aimed at me, which may be why I found it neither interesting nor entertaining.",/review/rw4348571/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_2018
437,14 January 2019,ironhorse_iv,7," 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' proves without a doubt, that good things do come in small packages. It was a fun superhero movie!
","Its takes two to make a thing go right. That's for sure. This twentieth film installment of the MCU & sequel to 2015's 'Ant-Man' was an awesome watch. Based on the Marvel Comics characters of the same name, the film once again follows Scott Lang AKA 'Ant-Man' (Paul Rudd) on his adventures into the microverse. This time, trying to rescue Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas)'s wife, Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) from the mini quantum realm. But first, with some help from Pym's daughter, Hope (Evangeline Lilly) AKA 'the Wasp', he must stop, a black market tech dealer, Sonny Burch (Walton Goggins) and ruthless intangible government assassin codenamed ""The Ghost"" (Hannah John-Kamen), from getting their hands on their technology. Without spoiling the film too much; it's would probably be wise to watch 2016's film 'Captain America: Civil War', before seeing this movie from director, Peyton Reed. Why? It's because, much of Lang's storyline in this, is entangled with what happen in Germany. Regardless, the film does a decent job of summing all the events, leading up to current day. However, some people might hate all the exposition dump. After all, some of the information can be a bit overwhelming to take. For example, all the pseudoscience mumbo jumbo does gets a bit ridiculous to the point that the movie had to make a joke about it. Nevertheless, there is one thing that the motion picture didn't do good job, explaining and that's antagonist's origins. I really find it hard to believe, that 'The Ghost' was a stealth operative for S.H.I.E.L.D for a very long time, yet she was not use in the Avengers Initiative nor the organization split up in 2014 at all. You would think, she would had some sort interaction with any previous Marvel hero, before, this film. Yet, this is the first time, we are hearing about her. Another thing, the movie doesn't do a good job, explaining, is delving into if her father, Elihas Starr (Michael Cerveris) was a disgraced spy for HYDRA or not. It's really disappointing, because her father had a bigger role in the comics. Here, he is just a toss away character. Despite that, I do like, most of the updates, the writers, Andrew Barrer, Gabriel Ferrari, Rudd, and Adam McKay did with her. They made a character that originally, a one-dimensional bitter old man, into a new compelling sympathetic force of nature. Hannah's performance was great. Her frustrations, rage, and determination are evident in every scene she is in. However, her character does a lot of stupid things, for somebody who supposed to be a highly trained assassin. I guess, showing trouble with her powers to the point, that it is slowly killing her body is a great way to explain, how frantic & clumsy, this person can be, when trying to gain the tech. Regardless, you still really do buy into that, she might go through about any means necessary, just to survive. I just wish, the movie had the balls to allow her to go there. Nevertheless, I felt the Deux ex Machina ending with her was a bit of a cop-out. As for the other villains. I hate that Bill Foster (Laurence Fishburne) was downplay to the point, that he doesn't pose much of a threat. For somebody, once known as 'Goliath', he's pretty much a minor character. Sucks that there wasn't no two giants fighting it out battle. That would had been cool. As for Sonny Burch. He could had been a decent antagonist. Unfortunately, the movie treat him as a common comic relief. Don't get me wrong, Goggins is hilariously in this typical sleazy role, but a little more overtly dramatic performance could had made him, seem a little more fun to watch than a semi annoying bugger. Talking about villains, whatever happen to the rogue agent that got hold of Pym particles in the end of the last movie? It has never been addressed. As for the heroes. Lilly was phenomenal as the Wasp. She totally kick butt. Glad, they didn't turn her into a villain, just yet. Honestly, I hope, they don't take the Red Queen route. As for Douglas. He was great. Still, I would love to see his character's several split personalities issues come up, one day. As for Rudd; he is great, as the everyday man who happens to be a superhero. Yet, the whole mind possession gimmick acting with Janet was a bit too odd for my taste. Regardless, the most frustrating thing about Rudd's character, was very misguided, weak ass mistake, Lang does with the ex-con buddies that sets up the third act. I found his actions to be, illogical and out of place, for somebody who is a seasonal criminal. It was a bit annoying. I blame that on the writers. The ex-con buddies' part, felt once again, not needed. Nevertheless, most of the characters are likeable. The humor does shine here; much at Scott's expense after his malfunctioning regulator leaves him temporarily stuck at different sizes. However, it does beg the question, how he can quickly recovered in a few minutes, being over 80 feet tall, yet in 'Civil War', he need to three days for 65 feet. Regardless, the hot potato action scenes with the lab were very fun to watch, especially the car chase and the fight in the kitchen. Please, do yourself a favor and see this movie in IMAX 3D & don't forgot to watch to post-credits scene here, it's massively important to the plot of 2019's film, 'Avengers Endgame'. You deserve to see all the awesomeness with the added dimensions these formats bring, including the wonderful Stan Lee cameo. Overall: Despite having no answers for 2018's ""Avengers: Infinity War' fans. In the big picture, it was a lighthearted palate cleanser film that was really needed to be seen. It's entertaining to watch. So check it out! It's a small wonder.",/review/rw4348571/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_2018

","'Ant-Man and The Wasp' tells what is perhaps the lowest-stakes story of the MCU, which is both a good and bad thing. It does feel refreshing that not even a single city is being threatened, and instead the stakes of the story are all personal ones to the characters, however at the same time this gives less urgency to the already weak plot and the fact that there is no real villain doesn't help either. Also there are some characters and side-plots that actually feel rather irrelevant as they are introduced but not explored much. Luckily though, the film is a constantly entertaining one that understands its world, characters and humour. The action sequences are once again wonderfully inventive and the filmmakers are finding ways to make sure that powers of 'Ant-Man and The Wasp' never get old. Also, the cast are all terrific and Christophe Beck manages to deliver another fantastic score that thankfully keeps the great main theme of the original. The film is more enjoyable than the first and while it's not top tier MCU, it comfortably fits in the middle of their repertoire and proves to be a thoroughly enjoyable picture. 7/10",/review/rw4348571/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_2018

This is a great sequel to the 2015 Ant-Man and it starts with Paul/Scott Lang on house arrest, after getting into trouble working with the Avengers, back in the civil war-The Captain America one.

Michael/Hank Pym and his daughter Evangeline/Hope Van Dyne are working on finding Michelle/Janet Van Dyne, who if you remember from the first movie, is lost somewhere in the Quantum Realm-a sub atomic shrunken universe. Guess whose help they need to find her? Yep, Paul. You have to have a villain in the movie and this time it's Hannah/The Ghost. FYI: In the comics, The Ghost was a male and he never fought Ant-Man. He was usually a pain in the keister to Iron Man. Hannah has phasing powers-she can turn immaterial and walk through walls-and she knows how to fight pretty good. There is a lot of humor, along with the super heroics, and it ends with a little cliff hanger for Paul, to be continued in the Avengers:Infinity War sequel, I'm guessing. Stan Lee has his usual cameo and there are 2 scenes as the end credits start. The first one shows us that this movie does take place during the same time as the Avengers:Infinity War. The second one is just plain comical.

","Review:
After watching Avengers: Infinity War, this movie is a right joke. It's more like a Carry On movie than a superhero film, and the jokes weren't even that funny. When the Ant-man was supposed to knuckle down and battle against evil, he still was splurting out these unfunny lines, which became extremely annoying after a while. Also, his superpowers have lost the shock factor, and it didn't help that the super suit didn't work half of the time. The so-called enemy was also pretty useless, but the first fight against the Wasp wasn't too bad. The storyline had way too many holes in it, and there were loads of times that they could have shrunk to get out of certain situations. I did enjoy the first movie, but this sequel really did need a re-write. With that aside, it's still an important movie in the Marvel world because I'm sure that the Quantum Realm will play a big part in the Avengers coming face to face with Thanos again. Anyway, two years after Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) was placed on house arrest due to his involvement with the Avengers in violation of the Sokovia Accords, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and his daughter Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) briefly manage to open a tunnel to the quantum realm. They believe Hank's wife Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) might be trapped there, after shrinking to sub-atomic levels in 1987. When Scott had previously visited the quantum realm, he had unknowingly become quantumly entangled with Janet, and now he receives an apparent message from her. With only days left of house arrest, Scott contacts Hank about Janet, despite the strained relationship they have due to Scott's actions with the Avengers. Hope and Hank kidnap Scott, leaving a decoy so as not to arouse suspicion from FBI agent Jimmy Woo (Randall Park). Believing the message from Janet to be confirmation that she is alive, the trio work to build a stable quantum tunnel so they can take a vehicle to the quantum realm and retrieve her. Now, on paper, the concept sounds pretty impressive but the director made the whole film as a comedy, which took away the deep complexity of the quantum realm. Michael Douglas tries to bring some depth to the whole movie, along with his daughter but it's swept under the carpet, because of it's silly characters which include a black market dealer, Sonny Burch (Walton Goggins), who has been selling Hope parts needed for the tunnel. Sonny soon realises the potential profit that can be earned from Hanks research and tries to double-cross them. During a fight with Sonny's men, Hope is attacked by a quantumly unstable masked woman ""Ghost"" (Hannah John-Kamen) who escapes with Hanks lab, which has been shrunk down to the size of a suitcase. Hank reluctantly visits his estranged partner Bill Foster (Laurence Fishburne), who helps them to locate the lab but the Ghost captures the trio and reveals herself to be Ava Starr. Her father Elihas, another of Hanks former partners, died along with his wife during the experiment that caused Ava's unstable state. Now with all this going on, you would think that the movie would be entertaining..... well your wrong. There is a sense of intensity with Ava, which made her mysterious at the beginning but it doesn't really lead to anything. The same goes for Bill Foster, who was quite important to the plot but he didn't make a big impact. When they finally get the tunnel going, and Hank retrieves Janet from the quantum realm, she helps Ava and they live happily ever after. What poor writing! If it wasn't for the ending, which connects this movie to Infinity War, the whole film would have been pointless. I'm sure that I would have to watch this movie again, once Endgame comes out, but I really thought that it had Disney's footprint all over it. If they release another Ant-man movie, they really need to bring some seriousness to the script because this film really wasn't my cup of tea.

448,3 August 2018,TheMovieDiorama,5," Ant-Man and the Wasp shrinks so far down that it in itself becomes pointless.
","What I can only describe as the biggest disappointment of the year thus far, this entry into Marvel's epic cinematic universe is possibly their weakest yet. In this chapter, Ant-Man must team up with Wasp in order to retrieve her missing mother from the quantum realm. Right, where to start? Before I detail my thoughts, I would like to highlight that I do enjoy the offerings from Marvel Studios. What this sequel has going for itself is continuity. It very much feels like an additional chapter, referencing previous scenarios from its predecessors. The characters retain their scintillating personalities, particularly Scott, Hope and Luis, maintaining the consistency of the original. Imaginative use of visual effects to illustrate the quantum realm and manipulate size transformations during the infrequent action sequences. The inherent issue that shrouds this entry, is the fact that it is defined as a ""filler"" in a densely developed arc story. That would be justifiable, if I could say this film was fun. It's not. It grows increasingly boring with each minute. Nothing happens! Any situation that does occur, whether it be characters reuniting or family bonding, contained no substance. The whole plot and it's characters were painted with such a thin layer of gloss, that it actually it amounted to nothing. The use of both visual and literary comedy missed at every opportunity, conveyed so forcefully as if Rudd was shoving his effortlessly charismatic personality down your throat. Honestly, some of the ""jokes"" were horrendous. The human CGI is quite painful to watch and takes you out of the innovative set pieces that director Reed attempts to convey. Ghost, who's molecular instability looks fantastic, is underdeveloped. Burch was pointless and his sole purpose is to provide henchmen for an action sequence. The acting was serviceable at best and the plot is filled with illogical conveniences. It's rare that I say this, particularly for a Marvel film, but I'm in the minority. As far as I'm concerned, this film can go subatomic.",/review/rw4348571/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_2018

The humor works so much better then the first film, and is once again some of the best humor in the MCU.

","It's been just over two months since Avengers: Infinity War left viewers paralysed with that unexpected and somber ending. Yet film forums and chatrooms are still endemic with what happened, why it happened and how it can be undone in Avengers 4 (currently untitled). Which is why Ant-man and The Wasp couldn't have come out at a better time. There's none of that do or die scenario which immediately elevates this film above something as colossal and imposing as saving the universe, essentially making this sequel a story with a little charm and a lot of humour and with just the right amount of action.
 
Two years after backing Cap in Civil War, Paul Rudd's Scott Lang is under house arrest and nearing the end of his sentence. Although this could explain why the Ant-Man wasn't seen in Infinity War, the story suggests that the film isn't too concerned of its position in the MCU. Instead, the story builds on the hypothesis that if Lang could return to his fully functional form after his subatomic adventure in the previous film, then there's a slim possibility of finding Hank Pym's (Michael Douglas) long lost superhero wife and the first Wasp (Michelle Pfeiffer). Together with Hank's daughter Hope (Evangeline Lily as the new Wasp) this is their mission until a new and dangerous character surfaces with an opposing agenda.

I haven't seen ""Avengers: The Last One"" (not a real title, I just haven't seen the last one) but it seems it draws a little bit from what happened. Something about a stolen suit. Blah blah blah. Or something. I don't even know, the point is Evangeline's mom was lost 30 years ago and they have to recover her so they build this tunnel to go into the void to pull her out. Not sure why this wasn't attempted earlier. By the way, I use the actor's real names because, let's be honest, who cares? It's them.
There's also this side story with someone called Ghost, who got blasted years ago with quantam energy and needs a component to make a machine work because that's the same component that Michael Douglas/Evangeline needed to make the same machine work and never mind ghost never bothered asking them. Instead she hits up Larry Fishburne (who is double dippin' from the DC universe...weird).
So, look, the action is fun, the wise-cracking is fun. It's really a vanilla movie, but somehow is offensive...with the Michael Pena character with a van that plays a typical Mexican tune (La Cucaracha), though he's Cuban. I don't care about that stuff and find it funny, but somehow Disney...ahem...Marvel gets away with it. Fine.
It's worth the time...barely.
Are these long winded side jokes the new thing? Walton Goggins being the greatest sinister bad guy is diluted to...corny banter? Does anyone NOT crackwise (even Michelle Puh-Feiffer gets a bit).

Ghost was a baseline human in the comics who got his powers from the suit. The MCU version is an enhanced human who got her powers from an accident; the suit helps her manage them. Janet van Dyne is a complex example of the trope. In the comics she is a baseline human who later got additional abilities to shoot bio-energy blasts, but here is a baseline human who derives her powers from the suit. Initially, at least. Her time in the Quantum Realm has given her additional powers that she cited as being ""evolution"".

","Ant-Man and the Wasp is a lot like Thor Ragnarok, and honestly I think I liked it a bit more. The humor landed well with me, especially with Pena and Rudd. I really like the visuals - the action sequences seamlessly transition with them shrinking and enlarging, and those transitions are what make the action scenes successful. I did think the movie leaned a little heavily on the action, and inconsistencies in the action sequences abound as always (they are very willing to shrink themselves and the car and risk getting crushed, and the power/mass they have as their size varies doesn't seem consistent at all). Some of the emotional notes land - the relationship between Scott and his daughter is genuinely touching, and the Pym family drama is good. I didn't think Scott and Hope's relationship arc made sense - Hope was extremely upset at Scott when they meet and doesn't want to talk to him, but without any substantive discussion or resolution she's suddenly referencing how they had sex and flirting about how they had success as partners in the past? The script also didn't feel fully coherent because there were so many plotlines that seemed to pop up randomly. In particular, what did the black market guys add to the movie aside from confusion (and parts at the beginning)? I kept hoping for more development with Ghost, but didn't think the acting was great and just didn't amount to much. The ending with Ghost also could not have made less sense - Van Dyke comes back from the quantum realm and just by touching her face saves her? Just bizarre. The writing of the police chief and his interactions with Scott did feel silly and like forced humor. In general, I didn't think the ending gave emotional payoff to the long build that came before it. As often happens, all of the various groups of bad guys are foiled or tamed easily, and everything just comes together cleanly.

However I felt the storyline was a little weak and the comedy of the first film was just not there. We had a bad guy who was chasing the good guys all through the film and if he wasn't there, the film would still get to its conclusion in the same amount of time. We did however get some great action from Ant Man and The Wasp themselves and several fabulous car chases involving varying sized vehicles and people. Michael Douglas was great as Dr Hank Pym and there were several amusing one liners.

","After the depressing bloodbath that was Infinity War, we needed something lighthearted to make us feel better, and this film delivered. It had all the humor of the first one, but also knew when it needed to be serious. Some of the running jokes do get old after the 4th time, but some still work. The action sequences are some of the most fun I've seen this year. The villain, while very cool, did some kind of generic in terms of motivation, and I saw the twist coming. Many people were worried this was going to be SJW propaganda, but it is not. It does what ""Incredibles 2"" should have done. There were too many villains in this movie, too. I think Marvel, in terms of villains, is starting to suffer from DC-itis. Overstuffing the movie with too many characters just for fanservice. There is also one moment in the film where there is a race against time, and when the time runs out...nothing happens, thus rendering the stakes useless. Overall, it was about on par with the first movie, and still had lots of great humor. If you want to see a superhero movie that's borderline parody, but never quite that, than this is the film.

A feel-good, undemanding ride that benefited from its funny cast and where all the jokes hit the right note. Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) worked decently together, neither character ever taking away from the other's arc, while side-characters benefited from a plethora of comedic moments. Now was it perfect? By no means, unfortunately most of the action had been spoiled in the trailers beforehand and there was the annoying Marvel villain problem. While Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen) had a certain flair to her both in and out of her awesome suit, she didn't really bring much to the table. Also, some of the quantum-realm mumbo-jumbo boggled minds and made little sense. The final flaw in my opinion was Michelle Pfeiffer's Janet Van Dyne, who had very little, if nothing to do.

For the most part, Ant Man and the Wasp in a fun, entertaining movie, especially when it comes to the action set pieces that involve getting smaller or larger. I especially liked the car chase scene. The villains in this movie are fine, they're serviceable villains for an OK story. Paul Rudd is good and so is Evangeline Lilly. I think Michael Douglas is kind of phoning it in at this point, though and I thought the girl who plays Cassie wasn't particularly good. I found the editing slightly bizarre, like cutting scenes very quickly without letting the audience have like adequate time to savor each moment. The quantum stuff was good, although I would have liked to see more of that. I thought some of the writing, particularly concerning the humor was very hit or miss, at least for me. Some scenes, especially with the FBI agent who's in charge of Scott did work pretty well, though. Overall, though, this movie is exactly what you would expect.

I thought the fact that the original Wasp was still alive after 20 years was just too much and too extreme of a jump, and overall just not a good concept, but the scene with Scott and his daughter just playing together and just having a good time inside of the cardboard was fun. My main problem with the movie though was that there was really no villain. Ghost was just an antagonist trying to help herself, and the illegal technology seller also was also, and neither was a good character. I just feel that the main problem is that all of them are going against each other when if you think about it, if they all work together they would all get what they want and in less time, and this entire movie wouldn't have to happen. Also, the action sequences were good, but every single one of them were in the trailers. But the worst part, the ending, when they brought Jan back, which shouldn't have happened anyway, she gets powers out of nowhere and cures Ghost, this did not make sense at all! Finally, the first end credit scene was very predictable, and the second one was easily the worst and most pointless end credit scene in the history of the MCU.

","The first Ant Man had zero expectations on it and turned out to be a great heist movie built into a super hero film. Ant Man & the Wasp is another side jaunt into the wider Marvel Universe that doesn't add to the developing Infinity series.
The big villain is Ghost, a tragic character who I felt more empathy for than Hank Pym. Her storyline as an exploited child for a Shield weapons program was more interesting than the overall rescuing Janet Pym and the search for the lab shenanigans that take up most of the storyline.
Paul Rudd is likeable and funny as always, humanising a plot that is basically just about adding the word Quantum to everything as Rudd wryly points out. Evangeline Lilly is excellent as the Wasp and Walton Goggins makes for an effective side villain as Sonny.
It's also fantastic to see Luis back and Michael Pena gets some great screen time. Along with the ever dependable Michael Douglas, Michelle Pffeifer, Laurence Fishburne and Randall Park, the cast doesn't miss a step and raises an average plot beyond what it deserves.
Overall Ant Man and the Wasp is a fun addition to the Marvel Universe, but as Ghost could have made for a brilliant surprise Marvel film on her own, this feels like a missed opportunity.",/review/rw4348571/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_2018

Maybe, too much blue screen? There were some actual good action scenes, but most were so ridiculous looking I was shaking my head. The special effects were good at times and then extremely bad at times. Did they forget to edit this movie? The main villain in this movie was not well developed and poorly acted by the actress and most of all the other actors couldn't act and didn't seem to fit their parts.. The more known actors and guest stars ( Michael Douglas, Laurence Fishburne, and Michelle Pfeiffer), were all were very underwhelming in their performances. Definitely, no oscars in this movie. The humor in this movie was very predictable and fell flat. I found most humor in just how ridiculous this movie looked and was edited. Poor film with terrible acting, one liners, predictable plot and humor and forgettable villain. I give it 2 1/ 2 but could have been lower with out a decent performance from Paul Rudd and his relationship with his daughter which was a strong point in this movie.

691,2 May 2023,dakotadickenson-83457,8," A more than solid addition to the MCU.
","After helping Captain America in Captain America: Civil War, Scott Lang/Ant-Man has taken a plea deal in order to be closer to his daughter which requires probation and a ankle monitor which also requires him to be on house arrest. Also while he's at it, he's starting up a security business with Luis and the rest of his friends called Ex-Con. Life is going decent for Scott, until a dream of being back in the Quantum Realm and a encounter with Hank Pym's long lost wife makes him question what's real and what's not. When Hank Pym and Hope van Dyne build a tunnel to the Quantum Realm to rescue Hank's wife Janet, Scott must put his freedom at risk once again while teaming up with Hope's new superhero ego The Wasp and help them bring Janet back to the real world while also having new foes after them as well. So first off, this is probably my favorite version of Paul Rudd's Ant-Man bringing us the best version of the character we have seen so far. Evangeline Lilly's Hope van Dyne/The Wasp is fantastic and definitely the standout character of the film this time around. Michael Douglas's Hank Pym I felt in this film I thought was also the best version of the character we've seen so far. Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet van Dyne was a great casting choice for the character. I just wish we would of gotten a little more of her character, but the way the film is paced is why, but overall she's great. It's also noting that Michael Peña's Luis is funnier than ever in this Ant-Man showing us a little more of his character here than in the previous Ant-Man. Hannah John-Kamen as Ava Starr/Ghost is menacing, bringing us a type of villain we haven't in the Ant-Man films until now. Lawrence Fishburne I was very glad to see join the MCU as Bill Foster and had some of the best lines of the film. The rest of the cast did great as well. The action, the visuals, and story were twice as good as the previous Ant-Man. Overall, Ant-Man and The Wasp is a solid addition to the MCU that introduces us to great new characters, while also showing us what the possibilities could be ahead for the MCU.

693,31 December 2018,SeamusMacDuff,3," Too Much Ends Up As Very Little
","Way too much thrown into this film with way too little thought about how to tie it together. There are at least six plot-lines going on (saving Janet, Ghost, bad guys trying to steal the lab, Scott's family drama, Scott's security business, Scott's house arrest & FBI). Throw in the multiple personal relationships that are part of this (Hank-Janet-Hope, Scott-Hope, Scott-daughter, Hank-Bill, Bill-Ghost) and it's way too much.
On top of this, the pseudo-science is bad and never explained. When things shrink, do they get lighter or not? If not, you can't carry a building around. (Plus nothing can keep everything inside in place as it gets tossed like a football.) If so, then a bug-sized person can't deliver any kind of a punch. The quantum realm becomes a random do-anything power that's never explained, nor are Janet's powers after 30 years there. (Of course, she's a brilliant scientist like Hank instead of a playgirl socialite like in the comics. And gets smarter after years alone and without anything in the realm. All part of the Disney PC, like the rainbow casting.) Bugs can fly and tiny vehicles can drive faster than speeding vehicles. (Calculate how fast those tiny wheels would have to spin to do so.) Scott somehow made a 'quantum entanglement' that allows a mental (!) connection with Janet across the realm. Etc. Etc.
As far as acting, Rudd tries hard to span expectations but gets lost in the shuffle. Douglas has too big a role. Lilly has zero chemistry with Rudd; comes from trying to be the butt-kicking fem-warrior. She seems way too invested in a mom that she knew only 30 years ago as a small girl. Michael Pena though IS hilarious, as are Scott's other security team. Fishburne is extraneous. Ghost only has to act desperately pained. Pfieffer tries to make up for her short screen time by overdoing it.
Adds little to the MCU, even the obligatory after-credit scenes with an unnamed 'other' ghost and Scott apparently trapped when the Avengers 3 climax kicks in.

694,7 July 2018,MackMonMay87,7," ANT-tagonizing Crime, One Movie at a Time
","Ant Man was a pleasant surprise for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, presenting a hero with a unique power in a film that was self-aware and knew its limits, being a fun, family-oriented blockbuster with genuine laughs and very creative action. Ant-Man and Wasp is exactly the same, just a lesser version of that, like the Diet Coke to regular, calorie-loaded but tastier Coke.
The cast in this movie is what holds it together, every performance is solid, with especially high marks going to the overdue performance of Evangeline Lily as Wasp. Don't get me wrong, Paul Rudd is great as Ant-Man, but you can see the commitment flow off of Lily in her portrayal of one of Marvel's most classic heroines. She kicks butt with the enthusiasm of someone who's been waiting too long to do it.
The supporting cast is hilarious, with Michael Pena, T.I. and Randall Park providing some firm laughs, and some great visuals in the subatomic world.
Where it's really weak is in the story's main conflict and lack of a truly threatening villain. The newcomer Ghost has interesting and challenging powers, but her character is almost overly sympathetic, and Walton Goggins, while a good sleazy side-villain, doesn't really push the heroes either. 
The movie really needed someone to truly threaten the Pym/Lang families and come across as more dangerous. Perhaps a true villain who was manipulating Ghost could've added to it.
The comedy is great, but there needed to be more action and fight scenes, especially with Ant-Man and Wasp using their powers together. There's glimpses of this, but after the mindblowing action seen in Infinity War, there needed to be more on display here.
It does however open up some major potential storylines and elements with a few subtle scenes and the post-credit scenes, so don't miss this if you're strongly devoted to the MCU storyline.

","Ant-Man is Marvels comedic outlet. Although they are stretching it into other films, Ant-Man from the beginning started as a joke of a super hero and they have stuck by his side ever since.
 In this movie as the sequel coming off of Avenger: Infinity War, it was really here just to connect the dots. Not that it wasn't necessary, but really it could not exist and not much would change. They would just not have the extra billion dollars it will surely make. As far as the plot of the film is concerned it was a very average movie. I mean sure it had the nice Ant-Man flare of things growing larger and smaller, but for the most part it just passed by. Filling in the holes, but not making any new mountains or valleys. 
 However, as the comedic outlet of Marvel, it was a gold mine! Paul Rudd and Michael Pena as two of the leads will lend any movie into a comedic success. As well as adding in the writers of Chris Mckenna and Erik Sommers, and that is a talented group. The lines were clever, they tied in very well from the first Ant-Man and they were delivered exceptionally.
 Ant-Man and the Wasp definitely needed something for it to be remembered by and for this movie it will be a random one-liner here and there, definitely not one of the best Marvel has to offer, but one that will give you a pretty good laugh.",/review/rw4348571/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_2018

770,6 July 2018,newguy85,9," Appropriately named
","Ant-Man and the Wasp is the correct name, because this is more of a team up movie than the previous entry. 
I'll start by saying that Evangeline Lilly's Wasp is a badass. Her fight scenes used the shrinking ability to maximum effect.
The story is simple, yet compelling. It had a lot of heart, and a great ending. 
There are essentially 3-villains, 2 you can empathize with, the third a run of the mill bad guy, but due to the handling of the non run of the mills bad guys, I thought Marvel nailed it.
The tone was hilarious from beginning to end, there is a middle section where it gets really serious, but then is saved by Paul Rudd, who knows how to handle these types of movies due to his success w/ I Love You Man and This is 40. 
The sight-gags had us rolling, there is a scene where Ant-Man's suit is malfunctioning and we couldn't stop laughing. On a side note, it feels LOTR-esque the way they handle the size and proportions. 
Lastly, Michael Pena tops himself as the scene stealer with his frantic delivery. He's hilarious.
Lastly Lastly, I really enjoyed Randall Park's back and forth with Paul Rudd, it made for some of the best lines in the movie.
Overall this is a perfect movie for post Inifinty War, in tone and scale. You also get some explanation for their absence during the fights w/ the Black Order, but it's not 100% convincing.",/review/rw4348571/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_2018

","Good Fun. Based in SF and not New York is always a great change. This film is short but doesn't seem like it. It is clear, introduces characters from comic canon, brings back Janet, drops a hint as to how Scott Lang can go find Tony Stark to fulfill Dr. Strange knowing that Stark had to live to fix things later. Worth seeing if you enjoy Paul Rudd or Evangaline Lilly, or if you are following the MCU, or if you need help reclaiming some ""Hope"" for Avengers 4. Look up Kyle Hill's youtube Because Science video on why Ant-Man might be the most powerful hero which includes explaining Quantum Mechanics. Quantum Tunneling and World Lines along with ""Time Vortex"" are important.

To me it wasn't serious enough as the plot was stable but 2 villains that didn't get much back bone, one was nearly on the brink of death but hides away and the red neck gets busted. I could see the direction it was heading. Like once they had found the mother/wife why didn't they question her on how she drank and ate or where she found the white rags??

","The story is very hip-hop like. Like the ant-figth. Hannah's null-mimic, the FBI agent's foulness and that constant extortion through the movie is horrible. Rudd's simple character could compensate a bit with its big-heart attitude. The reference at the end to Thano's solution to the problem of the galaxy is a bit unlikely, but believable.

","The first Ant-Man was a pleasant surprise even though Edgar Wright left the project. It brought a unique experience to the MCU. This movie provides a welcome change of pace after the darker Infinty War. This was a movie that you could just sit back and enjoy. The action was fun and the humor felt natural. The story was where I had some issues. It takes a bit to get going because the film tries to catch you up with what everybody's been doing since the first Ant-Man. The ending had some problems too. It felt a little too perfect until the end credits. Ghost was an ok villain with a great performance. Sonny Burch however stood out in a bad way. There was really no arc for him. The wasp was a good complement to Ant-Man. The two worked well with each other with some great team up fights. I wish they could have used more of Scott's knowledge from his criminal days to aid in the mission. Scott being an ex criminal made him unique from the other heroes. The Three Wombats were still the standout characters just like the first one. They made for some entertaining and funny scenes.

Just a little, though, since Infinity War had more than enough content even without Ant-Man and I can't argue with the writers - connecting Ant-Man at this point was a bit too hard because of the difference in the mood.

Sure it's not as magnificent as the preceding Infinity War or doesn't have the same depth as Black Panther or Winter Soldier, but it was wholly entertaining, heartwarming and a good laugh. The antics have been upped in this film from the original Ant Man and to great effect, especially with the cars constantly changing size and the chase scene around San Francisco was fun to watch! It balances great comedy, scientific discussions, adventures into the Quantum realm and a heartwarming family story in one film. They played on many of the strengths of the first film and yet what made the movie stronger is the increased ferocity of Lilly's Hope aka The Wasp character, really great to see another strong female superhero in the MCU! I think what was also great is having a diverse cast in terms of race, gender and age! It's true the villain of the ghost is no huge villain, but an interesting character for sure who you can actually sympathise with due to her affliction, plus it's also interesting to see how S.H.I.E.L.D yet again was revealed to be not a very morally ethical institution at all times due to their connection with Ghost (of course it was infiltrated by Hydra anyway!) The immediate post credit scene is very important to watch if you're a Marvel fan and have seen Infinity War but there's no reason to stay until the final end credits scene since it's just silly and doesn't add to the storyline.",/review/rw4348571/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_2018
828,11 August 2018,Vuraxis,6," The low end of a Marvel movie
","This only just came out in the UK, so well done me for avoiding spoilers around my American friends for a full month. I'm a big Marvel fan, and never seem to be disappointed with what they come out with, maybe except for the lack of actually good action in Spiderman: Homecoming. But this lacks in all 3 fields.
The way I see Marvel movies, they are composed of 3 different areas; comedy, action and critical quality. The best ones are those that excel in at least two of those fields, for example Civil War, which had great action and critical quality due to it's character development and intriguing story, or of course, Infinity War, which smashed all 3 fields (though I still think it is way overrated). 
This movie was somewhat funny; like Homecoming, it had a side character with lots of wit. But he's not quite up to the same standard and is not half as prominent. The action is barely there, and when it is there it has an oversaturated use of the shrink and grow abilities, which you get bored of and it never attempts to show off any real good had to had combat, like what was in the first movie. Actually, a lot of the comedy feels ripped from Ant Man 1, with a lot of the jokes composing of zooming out the camera to show how pathetic the action looks from a normal person's view. And its critical value is very low. There is little to no character development, and every character feels formed to be completely generic. The sudden change in Ghost's personality at the end is so stupid. The final fight is boring and feels like something that needs a little Deus Ex Machina. And the post-credits scene feels like a forced and confusing way to both explain where Scott was in Infinity War and to leave the internet open to lots of theories. 
Probably Marvel's lowest point since 2015.",/review/rw4348571/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_2018

831,8 July 2018,Ska4Live,7," More action - less ideas.
","Shortly, without spoilers. Despite critics praises about how good this film is, personally, I feel some disappoint. Overall film is focusing about family members reuniting. From one side we see how Scott Lang trying to return back to her daughter after FBI puts him on home arrest(outcome after Civil War). From another side, Pym family, Hope Van Dyne and Hank Pym who are trying their best to return Hank wife, Hope's - mother, from quantum world, where she was locked for more than 30 years.
Obviously the weakest thing in Ant man and the Wasp - it is the scenario. We does not feel any tension and threat to our heroes during their mission. The sequel doesn't have strong and solid villain. We have some short sighted and weak Tech mafia who chasing our heroes fin order to get their tech developments. We have comedy FBI agents who chasing main heroes. Of course, there is Ghost, but the more we understand and learn about this character, the more questions we ask our self, are she really so bad and her actions are? Yes this film is full of action scenes, which show to us more Pym technologies, and it also has more comedy scenes then in first movie, but we can't said it is much funnier as it was ""Thor3: Ragnarok"". Joke on joke, actions scenes and jokes inside of them, moment of some small tension and jokes again, after a while it really gets boring. Only scenes with Mikael Pena character bring joy every time when we see him on the screen, oh yes and of course Randall Park - everything he say and how he say - is it hilarious. Paul Rudd - absolutely the same, as he were in first movie and Civil War. Evangeline Lily got more screen time, well yes, because she is the WASP(!) and she is one of the main characters, and because about 80% of all actions scenes in this movie, include her character. Hannah John-Kamen as Ghost, i don't know, her personage is mystery for me, empty place, i can't say i like her, but that's probably because of script and not about her acting skills. Once again main villain in ANT MAN and the WASP is screenwriters. Their lack of ideas and maximum interest on actions scenes, instead of dialogs and building new strong characters, poses last Marvel movie as a typical summer blockbuster for people who just wants to came in cinema to eat some popcorn.

","MCU is a work of genius. 3 Phases stretching back what seems like a generation. Phase 3 comes in two parts, which is a whacky idea in itself but I digress. Ant-man & The Wasp enters the scene after Infinity War but the action takes place at the same time. Releasing it after IW provides a moment of light relief following the tragic events of its predecessor. Michael Douglas & Laurence Fishburne have a few great moments, sparring with each other for laughs. Rudd pitches the comedy just right. He could've gone for over the top excess but he keeps a lid on it and so strikes a good balance between the moments of seriousness & the comical. Evangeline Lilly, is a particular fave of mine. She's a good choice for Pym's daughter. My only complaint is, the scenes of Lilly on the beach in her bikini were cut, supposedly to get the 12 cert (only joking). The supporting cast have a few enjoyable comedy scenes. Pena & Goggins play their parts with aplomb. The former is his usual over the top self and the latter plays the likeable baddy. Hank Pym is an abusive wife besting egotist in the comic books but here Douglas drops the abusive trait and plays up Pym's cantankerous, grumpy arrogant side. It all works really well. From the over officious, incompetent Feds and characterful giant ants, to great SFX and a fast paced screenplay. I wouldn't normally find anything for 12 year olds remotely funny but I found myself laughing at all the right moments. If you like good fun action movies with a comedic sensibility them this movie will tick all your boxes.

Hardly any chemistry exists between the characters except for Scott and his daughter. Even Mr. and Mrs. Pyms' long-awaited reunion seemed forced. While Ghost is not really a villain in the traditional sense, her desperation to live at the expense of others was selfish, not sensible, just like Dr. Soran in STG. Everyone else had someone to live for or save. Seeing that she only needed to wait ten minutes to be saved as well, and was promised as much, her decision to kill the Pyms doesn't seem to serve any purpose, as her character lacks depth. It would have been more noble for her to have sacrificed herself.

Meanwhile, a villainess known as Ghost emerges to steal Hank's lab for her own purposes. Ant-Man & the Wasp offers some much needed sunshine to a rather grim chapter in the MCU. The smaller story and heavier focus on humor was refreshing to see after Infinity War. I appreciate the film's commitment to this tone and that it didn't try to be anything more. That being said, I can't say it works as a whole. Though the story is on a much smaller scale, the writers threw in way too much material to fit into one movie. By the film's resolution, it doesn't really feel like these stories concluded rather than stopped suddenly in their tracks. The movie is approximately two hours long and this simply was not enough time to devote to the amount of story shoved into it. As an audience member, I can't say I really cared what happened to the characters by the end aside from the main plot line involving Scott, Hank, and Hope.

The Avengers are going to need all the help they can get and it will be nice to see Ant-man working with Tony (because they both have specialized suits) and the others, I hope the Wasp will be there as well. A quick mention about the Wasp claiming she was coerced into taking off part of her clothes, if she didnt want to take anything off she didnt have to I think she's playing this for her own purposes. Its just like Wonder Woman critics saying why did the amazons appear in bikini's, Uhh well why does Hurcules appear bare chested with a Loin cloth in all his movies, because that is what they wore during that period! Finally I wanted to refer to Avengers Infinity and say that the 3D finally showed atleast two or three scenes where the action flies in your face and you feel you can touch it, thank you. If you ever been to Universal studios Florida, many rides have these True 3D effects that aren't just depth perception but actually come out at you and that's a whole lot of fun, continue this in Infinity War 2 at the appropriate intervals naturally and tastefully it's what we expect in Imax 3D. Hopefully those tickets will go down, by the way the 4D experience for Jurassic World was just awesome, keep it coming but keep those prices down to allow more to go see it, its a treat for anyone who hasnt seen it. Going back to Infinity War this was so well done, the script, acting, action, and special effects all A+ all the way everyone was at the top of their game, awesome! A few suggestion, althought Thanos's face looked very well done in CGI, his body did not, it looked fake can you guys improve that, also the whole Hulk not wanting to come out?! Please give us Hulk in part 2 and not that stupid Hulk in Thor: Ragnarok who was acting like a child, please no! Let Mark Ruffalo be the intellect he's done a great job all around and please have the CGI on the Hulk be the equal if not better than he looked in Avengers Part 1 and 2. In Infinity War he looked fake, there was a decline in the CGI graphics and you guys have wracked up quite enough profits to be able to make sure that all the heroes get the proper attention, so please comply. That said can't wait to see Infinity War 2 (we all can't wait to see what happens, keep the script tight!) and Ant-man 3. You guys really have to pull all the stops on 3, with a bigger budget and a really tight script to really make it memorable, suggestion have Spiderman in the film, seeing him along side Ant-Man & the Wasp is really special because of their connection.",/review/rw4348571/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_2018

","Coming in as a sequel to one of the most forgettable MCU films 'Ant-Man', 'Ant-Man and The Wasp' manages to be better than that and has enough substance in it to keep the audience engaged. Michael Pena's Luis gives the comedic tone that was much needed for this film to avoid being a mediocre one. Paul Rudd too, along with being a superhero also provides some warmth to the film. 
'The Ghost' can be considered as a disappointing villain which means that it broke Marvel's streak of good villains that started with Killmonger in 'Black Panther' and ended with Thanos in 'Avengers: Infinity War'. 
The film had a lot of forced exposition and weak, unnatural character development. 
The film digs deeper and explores the Quantum Realm, giving as a clue of what could happen in 'Avengers 4'. Also, the post-credits are directly connected to the ending of 'Avengers: Infinity War.'",/review/rw4348571/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_2018

","I found 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' to be a competent, albeit underwhelming experience, especially when bringing into account the MCU film preceding it is undoubtedly one of the biggest films of all time. Paul Rudd remains to be a charismatic and likable down-to-earth lead from previous films. However, wherein his performance is strong, I found the material he was given from the script to be derogatory to the character, as he was portrayed here as a bumbling goofball who is incompetent in battle, which is clearly done just to make Evangeline Lilly's Wasp appear a much stronger character. I did enjoy watching Wasp in action, as she did have the better-choreographed scenes, and Lilly looked like she was having an absolute ball in this role, but I cannot help but feel her role felt like an attempt of a feminist statement saying ""women can be superheroes too"". I fully agree with that statement, but it should not be portrayed at the expense of making the male lead a laughable idiot. The comedy was pretty hit or miss too. There were many visual gags that got a laugh out of me, but then there were more dialogue reliant gags, such as Lang's phone going off, was just embarrassing to watch. The comedy, and furthermore, the story itself, just did not feel as sharp and fast-paced as the first film. And despite my bias aside, I do believe this was because Edgar Wright had no involvement whatsoever, whereas Peyton Reed seems to be more experienced in traditional by-the-numbers rom coms. The villains were also pretty lackluster, which is disappointing considering the recent winning streak Marvel has been having with its villains onscreen. Ghost, despite her great design, does not feel threatening or relatable whatsoever, and Walton Goggin's Sonny is just a businessman, whose involvement is based on business reasons. Other actors, such as Michelle Pfeiffer and Laurence Fishburne, felt pretty pointless as well. At least Fishburne looked to be enjoying himself more here than the DC Movies. Overall, ignoring my blatant criticisms, I still enjoyed this film despite how heavily flawed it was. It's a standard popcorn movie, and if I was to go anything other than pure entertainment, which I was fulfilled with, then of course I would be building myself up for disappointment.",/review/rw4348571/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_2018

I absolutely loved Thor: Ragnarok and Spider-Man: Homecoming (I'm saving Black Panther for a rainy/snowy day when I really need a new superhero movie). For me, Avengers: Infinity War was bold and brave and perfectly executed; there was a vision for it 10 years ago and the powers that be followed through on their commitment and did what the average movie goer never expected them to do with many of their characters.
Ant-Man and the Wasp had zero impact on the events of Infinity War in the same way that Black Panther avoided the issue of the Infinity Gems, and not having seen Black Panther I can't say if it suffers from the same, but with this movie it just feels like a too obvious sidestep.
Knowing what we know going in it's hard to be sucked in to caring about the events contained in Ant-Man and the Wasp, because we know that ultimately it is all inconsequential.
The only thing that saves this movie is the Morrissey reference and Scott's ringtone. Although Morrissey himself doesn't care for the nickname ""Moz"", it's very important that our children learn about him. There is an entire gneration of sullen, eternally sad kids that might not realize there is a voice out there that speaks to them, understands what their going through and cares about them. They're so used to listening to music DJ's constantly play that says nothing to them about their lives, and I think it's wonderful that someone took the time to them to tell those unhappy kids and teens that they are human and people understand that they deserve to be loved just like everybody else does.",/review/rw4348571/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_2018

The storyline is not my favourite, as saving Hank's wife isn't something get behind as vehemently, when compared to the grandiose of Infinity War or the redemption of Peter Parker in Homecoming. However, action sequences are very well done and the movie excellently embraces its gimmick of shrinking and enlarging for a humorous and entertaining effect. Evangeline Lily quickly establishes herself as a badass and capable heroine, and continues to do so throughout the movie (her new hairstyle and suit is also a major improvement to her look, as I was always distracted by her hair in Antman.) Paul Rudd provides many funny and lighthearted moments, but I was relieved that he proved himself useful and heroic in the second half of the film. Many other supporting characters provide humorous moments, mostly in a successful way. Luis is a joy to watch, providing a character I've never seen anything like before, due to his fast talking and child-like demeanour. Overall a solid movie that sets up many interesting characters for future titles. I'm sure we will see more of Ghost, Hank, Wasp the elder, and Bill Foster, and obviously Antman and the Wasp themselves. The mid credit scene is very unexcpected but definitely creates its intended effect. The final credit scene is a great jab at marvel fans, but I hope its a once off.",/review/rw4348571/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_2018

","Like most, i have been sucked into the MCU, for the past 10 years, they have entertained me for the most part(wasnt a fan of Incredible Hulk) up until Ant-Man. Paul Rudds original outing did not sell it to me. I like Rudd and the films director, Peyton Reed, but for me, Ant-Man was missing a certain appeal. The appeal that made me fall in love with the Cap, Iron man, Thor, Avengers movies.
I left disappointed and when the sequel was released, i was in no rush to watch.
After buying this title for my son, i can say that i regret waiting to watch this. Ant-Man and the Wasp was an absolute joy. Funny, smart, action packed storyline. It was a fun ride and honestly i would not mind another few sequels.

","Ant-man & the Wasp was another fun, lazy, entertaining and hilarious flick from the MCU that I enjoyed from what it was. As a Fanboy of these films for 10 years and coming from reading most comics as well, I genuinely found it fun and average despite flaws that are a doubt noticeable. For one, the action sequences were not as much memorable but very enjoyable which not all shine from that with the CGI that looked cool to see. Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lily were very great in this film, Paul Rudd as Scott lang was as ussual, excellent though I felt the film kind of put aside like a more comedic relief than a hero in this film while Evangeline Lily shining her performance at her role as Hope Van Dyne and Hank Pym played by Michael Douglas was great too. The jokes and humor in this film landed and some didn't, but thanks to Michael Pena's supportive role as Luis in this film, my god I loved this character till the end. Now my flaws wasn't just the villain Ghost who had a very basic backstory and didn't have much to live up to, my real flaw is that the film doesn't explore much into the Quantum Realm and by the last act of the film has some story elements about it that felt lazy and weren't explained well. Overall Ant-man & the Wasp was another genuinely very enjoyable Marvel film, the humor landed but not always, the Villain(s) weren't anything to shine for and felt some other villains could have been forgettable but unfortunately felt like an annoying aspect in the film, CGI looked great, very likable cast but Ant-man & the Wasp didn't feel new and forgettable to it's structure but still had a blast with 7/10",/review/rw4348571/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_2018

","In fact, I went for marathon Ant-Man + Ant-Man and the Wasp so comparing to Ant-Man, which was quite boring for me at the beginning (before Scott got the Ant-Man suit), Ant-Man and the Wasp was way better!

So whenever he sneaks out home, I was feeling anxious: would he be caught and be AGAIN in trouble because of it? The villain wasn't ""really"" bad, but her motives were real, you could relate to her and her actions. Also, the other ""villain"" (the business man) was rather annoying than bad?
