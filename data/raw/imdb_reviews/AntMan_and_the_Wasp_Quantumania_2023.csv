","After most entries in Phase 4 passed by without doing much to set up the next big bad in the MCU, I was eagerly anticipating this film given it would be the big screen introduction of Kang. While Majors shines as Kang, the rest of the film and even some of the narrative choices with Kang leave a bit of a ""meh"" feeling.",/review/rw8876173/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_Quantumania_2023
1,18 February 2023,flicklover,5," It's been a while now, but the MCU has really run out of gas....
","Well it's happened. The MCU has run out of gas. The last few MCU films have been lackluster at best. Not counting the sort of stand alone Spider-Man No Way Home. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is supposed to start the Phase 5 of this thing and if it goes on like this it's going to get worse!!! This film is of course competently made, looks good and is not horrible but is completely uninspired and like pretty much everything out of the MCE factory since Endgame it's totally forgettable. The reason that the MCU was so successful is that the films had characters we cared about. Stakes were there, of course they were lightoments but there were heroes to root for and some pretty good villains. We cared about what was on the screen. I didn't care at all about what I saw in Quantumania. Not that every film from Iron Man to Endgame was great but they were mostly at least better than average. The two previous Ant-Man films were among the weakest but were still more memorable than this one. The acting in Quantumania is fine but but again no one to really care about. Even Paul Rudd who is usually very engaging seemed just flat and disinterested here. He seems to be phoning it in. The only notable performance is Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror but he alone can't save the film from being a complete snooze fest. I was actually bored fir much if the film.",/review/rw8876173/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_Quantumania_2023

","As a huge fan of the first one, and almost as big a fan of the second one, I decided to go all out and see this one in 3D with the 4DX motion and sensory seats. What a let down; sure, sitting in the nicest seats for the best visual, motion and sensory experience was great, but I felt like I was watching a Looney Tunes story, instead of any type of story that is part, or compliments the MCU timeline. This was literally one of Marvel's dullest and most unnecessary movies to date. The entire story was cliched and predictable, and there was more CGI than there was any type of interesting story, let alone one with any substance. Even the normally awesome and hilarious humor in the previous installments was absent in this one. Almost the entire film is taking place inside a CGI story, so there was no need for any movie sets or locations... this was all green-screen nonsense. It's a very generous 6/10 from me, only because I still enjoyed the fun ride in my upgraded seats, although the money spent would've been more fun at an amusement park.",/review/rw8876173/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_Quantumania_2023

","New Ant-Man is not a bad movie, but it's repeating current trend that been plaguing new Marvel productions. Main character is just an excuse to introduce few new characters that are definitely going to have their own stories. That makes Paul Rudd's character less important. You don't feel that this is his story. He is just there. And the story is not even that good. You can feel the lack of great characters from previous movies. They were setting the tone of story and we don't even know what happened to them after previous movie. It's hard to believe that the director is the same person who made two prior movies.

","Visually quite stunning with delightful and creative designs, shapes, and forms while the storyline is less than original without much in the way of intellectual or emotional, ethical depth of other recent Marvel movies. Apparently this movie was focused on being acceptable to a broad audience range, including young people, Quantumania loses some of its sharp refreshing focus. The created living entities of the quantum universe are more anthropomorphic (human-based) perhaps to be more relatable to children does not reflect the diversity or original forms of life or new-life that would really make this film stellar. As even as special as the set designs and special effects make for a gorgeous setting, there is still room for more crisp, detailed and immersive design work. Some backgrounds end up being mere basic animation projections that do not come up to the level expected of contemporary Marvel productions. Yes, this movie provides an amazing backdrop or canvas and yet the substance and plot of the movie does not rise to the same level. What one ends up with is a movie with a lot of flash but less than satisfactory bite.",/review/rw8876173/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_Quantumania_2023

","Ant-Man's 3rd solo outting. Doubling down on the sci-fi elements of the MCU. Overall the humor was like the rest of the previous movies. The cast was all stellar. Doesn't really dive that deep into Kang's story, but what we did get was sufficient. Johnathan Majors portrayal was excellent, just wish he had more substance to work with. The visual effects were definitely spotty. Blue screen overload, wish they took more time blending in the effects with with actors. This leads into Modok, as a concept. I didn't mind his backstop changing, just wish they went more practical with his design.

At least if Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania and such movies (and books, comics, whatever, quantity beats quality these days - in all fields) are the best human mind can come up with. The first Ant-Man movie was a nice one, the second one was okay, but if you take away all the (finally by computer generated) visuals and effects, there is maybe enough story left in this third chapter to employ two or maybe three and a half brain cells of the viewer. The rest of the neural network goes quickly into stand by and sleep mode. I like the production and a few scenes, this is the only reason why this one does not crash totally.

","Quantum Mania takes the MCU deeper into the quantum realm and presents us a real first taste of Kang the Conqueror. Thanos and his Infinity War are now part of the past in a timeline that has been upended by the discovery of the multiverse. The hype surrounding Ant-Man and the Wasp 2(?) seemed impossible to meet. The same weight was put on the Multiverse of Madness which cracked under the pressure of expectation. Unfortunately, QuantumMania suffers the same fate. Kang is intimidating, powerful and compelling but has been muzzled and restrained by a screenplay that lacks courage and risk when it mattered. Majors is fantastic as the character and I can't wait to see him develop this character and other variants further. However, I can't help but see a missed opportunity here to plant Kang like a unavoidable tree in the multiverse saga.

","The MCU in its current state is an absolute mess. Up until Endgame the whole series of movies felt like it lead up to something and now it's all over the place. Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania was supposed to introduce the next big bad that the Avengers will face in the form of Kang The Conqueror and I guess it did. First of all, Jonathan Majors plays the role well but the character itself seems like a total wimp. This is supposed to be one of the most powerful Kang variants and yet he gets trapped (maybe killed?) by Ant-Man and the Wasp without any sacrifice. Now, if the movie had the audacity to sacrifice both titular characters in order for them to stop Kang from escaping the Quantumverse it would've worked better but as it stands the movie takes no risks and has the villain defeated by characters that aren't even that powerful. After all that how are we as the audience supposed to believe that this guy can be a threat to more powerful Avengers like Thor or Dr Strange. On the other hand, if the movie did sacrifice any of the major characters it still wouldn't change how I feel about it. In fact, it would've maybe been a waste to sacrifice Ant-Man in such a bland and uninteresting film.",/review/rw8876173/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_Quantumania_2023

But Quantumania is a story riddled with holes (unlike one of its best side characters) and inconsistencies, and doesn't particularly add to the MCU as a whole either. For a movie deemed the most important for the next phase of the movies, it didn't have any long-lasting effects at all. It's nowhere near as fun as its predecessors (Luis is sorely missed), and too many of the characters are annoying or frustrating to watch (or barely present at all).

Like the fact that they were harvesting quantum energy from the quantum realm in the post credits of the last movie, yet Janet didn't seem concerned, even though she is very worried about the quantum realm, which they show in the trailer, so it's not something you'd only gather from watching the movie. Her backstory was kept quiet because they hadn't thought of it yet. Usually they keep things open for other Marvel movies, but this story felt very tacked on for the sake of this movie. Hope had some moments, but very little dialogue. Also, I thought I dozed off, as this movie seemed to jump from a long first act, to the third act. Jonathan Majors (Kang) does all the heavy lifting in this movie. His story, and his motivations seem the most developed.

I've always been fond of Scott, and he remains a likeable guy who *isn't* an a-hole/egotistical jerk (unlike certain other Avengers...who shall remain lifeless), but someone who cares about others, stands up for 'the little guy' and does what needs to be done for the greater good even if it means self-sacrifice. Although at the start of this film he's basking in the warm glowing warming glow of the fame that comes with being an Avenger, he remains NOT a jerk thanks to his family who bring him back down to Earth/keep him grounded.

","In Marvel Studios' 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania', our favorite pint-sized (and occasionally giant-sized) hero Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and co. Are sucked into, and subsequently trapped in, the otherworldly Quantum Realm. There, Scott is forced to make a deal with the Devil, or in this case the dictatorial Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), the only one with the means to get them home. As the title suggests, the majority of the movie takes place in this subatomic universe, which doesn't look half-bad, considering it's basically a fully-CG environment. It is home to some unique creatures and residents, who have fairly minimal roles and are ultimately kinda forgettable, though the one named Veb was hilarious. The movie wastes no time getting the plot in motion, as we're off into the Quantum Realm within the first 10 minutes, and it's pretty well-paced overall. As far as the cast, everyone does a solid job. Paul Rudd is delightful as usual, and Michelle Pfeiffer's Janet van Dyne gets some time to shine in a larger role than expected. Newcomer Kathryn Newton portrays Scott's now-teenaged daughter Cassie, and while it was cool seeing her suit-up alongside her dad, she comes off as a bit unbelievable at times. However, it's Jonathan Majors' Kang who steals the show. He's menacing, intimidating, and has a calm-yet-confident demeanor. I've always loved characters who know how much of a threat they are, like Darth Vader, and Kang definitely fits into that category. I truly cannot wait to see more of him in future MCU projects. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention MODOK, the most perfectly goofy and ridiculous character I've ever had the pleasure of meeting in a movie. Overall, 'Quantumania' is much bigger in scale than the previous films in the 'Ant-Man' series, but still retains most of the humor and heart that they've become known for. In fact, I personally like it better than the last installment, 'Ant-Man and the Wasp'.

","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania manages to clench the undying thirst for the unknown within the Marvel Cinematic Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania Universe, yet introduces so much that it doesn't really introduce anything at all. While being carried on the back of a strong performance by Jonathan Majors, Ant-Man: Quantumania is strictly a setup film, which is somewhat pointless, because it sets up what Marvel fans already know. Regardless of leaving little to no impact, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania's visuals are where it shines, literally and figuratively.

","I definitely dont think its as bad as the critics are making it out to be. I wouldnt say its rotten. But its definitely not a top favourite of mine either. Im not sure where I would rank it out of the whole MCU, but in terms of the other Ant-Man films, I still like the first one the best, and Id probably put this above the second one. My biggest gripe with this movie is the ending. Without giving too much away, I wish it had mirrored what Janet had done earlier during a flashback. And I didnt feel it was a satisfying end for Kang. I felt like it took him a peg down on being a badass villain. Which is a shame because I think Jonathan Majors was great in the role. Also, I wouldnt say the CGI is bad but there were a number of moments where it really looked like a bunch of actors standing in front of a green screen. Which I guess is a problem when 95% of your movie takes place in an entirely CGI world. So it kind of took me out a bit as I wasnt fully immersed as I should be. Although CGI wise I think M. O. D. O. K could have looked better. I know hes a weird looking guy to begin with. But it was definitely very uncanny valley in a bad way. Now I dont care that the last Cassie actor got replaced....but I dont think Kathryn Newton was a good replacement. I just didnt feel like she matched the previous Cassie's and I didnt feel like she had a lot of chemistry with the rest of the cast. And my other gripe, for a movie called Ant-Man and the Wasp you'd think they would both be the main characters but Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) didnt have a lot to do in this movie. I mean she also spends a good chunk of the movie separated from Ant-Man (Paul Rudd).

","I'm kind of getting tired of the MCU's constant stream of quantity over quality and this film is just another example of that problem slowly getting worse and worse. It's probably the most visually interesting of the trilogy only because it has more colors than the first two films combined. He actual visuals and cinematography aren't great though. Everything here feels very unmotivated and bland. It doesn't feel like there is a purpose to any of the shots and they are just going through a checklist of basic shots to get for the scene without feeling creative or interesting. The visuals effects range from okay to just bad. Clearly they didn't spend enough time on them and it really shows here because almost every shot has a lot of visual effects work done on them. There is no sense of size or space in these shots especially towards the end where Cassie Lang is over 10 times the size of MODOK but you really couldn't tell if you just watched the clip and not the whole scene. The story is kind of interesting? They definitely had a really solid first draft that just needed a little more work done but instead of doing that, they just took that first draft and ran with it so a lot of ideas and concepts feel underdeveloped and uninteresting. This could have been solved with a rewrite or two but clearly Feige and them don't care about actually doing that work. Most of the performances are good. Paul Rudd is still doing a great job and Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas are good as well. Jonathan Majors did a great job as well but with everything that came out after this film came out, the less said the better. Shame that he screwed up his career just as he was taking off. Bill Murray was kind of awful though here but thankfully his scene is short. Kang as the villain was the best part of the film. He was fun and engaging and his plan was interesting but his final scene is awful. For an all powerful being, he goes out really poorly. The humor is all over the place. Sometimes it's funny and sometimes it's unbearably unfunny. There really isn't a whole lot here to like but it's mostly just boring and not bad like Thor 4 and Black Widow.

Majors is a good choice to play Kang, but I feel he wasnt given a very good script for this movie. MCU's biggest problem has always been the villains, and to some extent, it's the case here too. Kang is supposed to be an avenger-level villain, but it doesnt show it here. He has the presence and powers, which he shows when he threatens scott and cassie and freezes janet, but when it comes to the final battle, he doesnt use those powers. Instead he uses his energy beam thing, which I think is not as effective. He couldve destroyed the ants easily, but no. He even got his suit damaged by the ants. There are plenty to like about this movie though. Paul rudd is great as ever, and kathryn newton is refreshing. I like how she's not suddenly a strong and experienced fighter even though she has the suit. I do miss michael pena and TI, but I understand they wouldve been underused if included.

","If you're looking for a dazzling display of special effects (especially in 3-D), then this latest installment in the Marvel Universe's ""Ant-man"" franchise is for you. However, if you're looking for an absorbing story, more along the lines of ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" (2022), you'll probably want to look elsewhere, despite the superb eye candy on offer here. Though visually dazzling, director Payton Reed's latest feels like something of a placeholder entry in the ongoing string of movies in this long-running series of action-adventures. Set in a vividly colorful, fantastically landscaped universe that exists below our reality at the quantum level, this picture tells the story of an unlikely superhero (Paul Rudd) and his family of colleagues (Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Kathryn Newton) who become inadvertently trapped in this strange world and desperately look for a way to get home, but they must first match wits with a dastardly, powerful villain (Jonathan Majors) who stands in their way. What ultimately transpires, however, is a story that's eminently predictable and fairly formulaic, reminiscent of many other such tales, such as ""Tron: Legacy"" (2010). Also, like many other Marvel movies, the concluding sequence is once again entirely too long (even though the overall length of this production is, thankfully, comparatively shorter than many of its protracted peer releases). To its credit, the film features fine performances by Pfeiffer and Majors, as well as a commendably lucid explanation of the rudiments of quantum physics. However, these strengths, along with its stunning visuals, aren't enough to overcome the overall narrative blandness of this offering. While ""Quantumania"" is certainly best viewed on the big screen in 3-D for maximum visual effect, this film might otherwise be considered a candidate worth waiting for its streaming debut. The kind of overkill on display in this work isn't doing the Marvel Universe any good, something that really needs to be borne in mind for the future of these releases.",/review/rw8876173/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_Quantumania_2023

","After helping defeated Thanos and saved the universe, Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) has become a celebrity with a best selling book and made up for lost time with his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton). During dinner at the home of love interest Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) and her parents Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and the recently returned Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), Cassie showcases a device that can map the Quantum Realm where Janet was lost by sending signals which Janet is none too happy about for reasons she doesn't share. The device opens up a worm hole sucking in Scott, Cassie, Hope, Hank, and Janet sending them to the Quantum Realm with Scott and Cassie in one area and Hope, Hank, and Janet in another, where they soon find themselves caught between a resistance between the denizens of the Quantum Realm and the tyrannical despot Kang the Conqueror (Johnathan Majors) who has a connection to Janet.",/review/rw8876173/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_Quantumania_2023

","Do you recall the Journey to the Center of the Earth with Brendan Fraser from 2008? I got a similar feeling watching this. Though the CGI had somewhat improved in the past 15 years, you still don´t give a damn about much that is happening onscreen because it is very obviously fake and shot on a green screen. While the Journey was fun in a guilty pleasure kind of way, this movie just puts you to sleep. I am so glad that I skipped it in the theater. If this is the way marvel movies are heading now, I will skip any future releases as well. Thor Love an Thunder looked horrible, this does as well. The only redeeming quality was Kang, who managed to wake me up in the second half of the movie, though I've heard rumors that due to some allegations Disney and other studios might want to be disassociated with Jonathan Majors for the future. There was little chemistry between the actors, the jokes are flat, the movie looks painfully fake and the third act fight with faceless soldiers against no-name troops is anticlimactic. Why even bother with this movie? Why even bother with Marvel past Endgame? So far, none of the post-endgame movies had really justified their existence.

","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the story of a family that gets transported to the Quantum Realm and spends a majority of the movie trying to defeat Kang the Conqueror, played nicely by Jonathan Majors (Creed III), who controls the alternate reality and escape from it!! Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania stars funnyman Paul Rudd (Ghostbuster: Afterlife) as Scott Lang with his superhero alias as Ant-Man, an Avenger who is coming fresh off a victory with some of the Avengers, saving the entire world and is feeling pretty good about it in the beginning part of this film!! Also starring in this movie is Canadian actress Evangeline Lilly (Lost) who plays Hope Van Dyne with her superhero alias as The Wasp having the ability to fight and fly with great power and speed when she has her wasp suit on. Michael Douglas (Wall Street) as Dr. Hank Pym, Michelle Pfeiffer (Batman Returns) as Janet Van Dyne, and Kathryn Newton as Cassie Lang all round out the top members of this cast as members of an extended family. It is at Dr. Pym's house where the group accidentally gets beamed to the Quantum Realm and spend a majority of the movie fighting aliens and Kang in order to get back to San Francisco and Earth. Quantumania - as I will be calling it for the remainder of this review - is a good movie - it's good but it is not great!! I like how the movie takes us from beautiful San Francisco all this way to this glowing dystopian Quantum Realm but once we are in the Quantum Realm there is not much imagination to the sets besides what we are given. The acting is good, Rudd combines comedy with action like nobodies business and is one of the few people that could play this role successfully!! The story is the same for Lilly, she does a terrific job as the Wasp, especially with the fight scenes!! Peyton Reed did a nice job directing this film and bringing all of the different talent together to tell a cohesive story. The team of Jeff Loveness, Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, Jack Kirby, and Ernest Hart all did a nice job contributing to the story of Quantumania in some way or the other. Christophe Becke handled the music for Quantumania very well!! Sammy Sheldon did a nice job costuming all of the different characters - superhero or otherwise!! Quantumania received a PG-13 rating so it requires parental supervision for those under 13 otherwise it is the perfect movie for those seeking a fun escape for a couple hours!! 6 out of 10 stars!!",/review/rw8876173/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_Quantumania_2023

The purpose seems to be to ground the story into something concrete, tangible and accessible, some relatable terra firma to allow us the audience even further immersion into the viewing experience. It's a neat story-telling device, which Ant Man has employed through all his movies so far- culminating in no less than the term quantum mechanics being integrated into the title of his third outing. And so ""Quantumania"" perseveres in the long MCU tradition of playing fast and loose with austere scientific concepts to engage the audience in a wild fantastic evidently neverending adventure. ""Quantumania"" isn't MCU's best, but it upholds the MCU's most tried and true science fiction fantasy tradition. And just as in science, once all the phases come into play, the sum should amount to greater than its parts. Ant Man has now cast his part in the lot, to be tallied later down the line, and it is a good part, if a bit part, from the character most likely to be overlooked- except for one thing: quantum mechanics, applied and theoretical, is a huge deal..!

I was surprised to see Bill Murray in this flick, but not surprised that he did his standard Bill Murray type of schtick. He should try mixing things up every now and then. As for M. O. D. O.

As a 100% VFX heavy movie, there's some pretty impressive visual effects and also some questionable effects as well. Unfortunately the script was mediocre with poorly written dialogues that devoid of emotion. The film was unnecessarily too long and slow pacing. Probably another victim of MCU's mandatory 2 hour runtime stipulation. I'm not against the idea, but without a solid script and a creative direction there's nothing else to do that can make a movie entertaining that long.

Also, how many times can Cassey and Scott hug before or after a fight in one movie. The best part of Ant-Man Came in the last 5 minutes. I feel like Marvel has done the bright cheery movies for too long at this point and needs to take their movies in a more serious (not necessarily dark) tone but definitely more serious. Tuning into a Marvel movie at this point you just know The formulaic movie that you're getting with not many surprises. Love Paul Rudd so I thought he was great. Jonathan Majors as Kang was great just like I said in Loki but with his personal battles I wonder what Marvel will do. Side note: total bs that Flash is getting RAVE reviews when Ezra Miller is an absolute legit psychopath and Jonathan Majors is being disbanded over accusations that have been dropped. Back to the movie: wasn't huge on the CGI/ scenery. Wasn't huge on the acting. Wasn't huge on the storyline. Ant Man And The Wasp Quantumania gets a 6.6/10 for me.

Basically, Scott Lang aka Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) has written his autobiography, Look Out for the Little Guy, which becomes successful, and he has settled with his girlfriend, Hope van Dyne aka The Wasp (Lost's Evangeline Lilly). Scott's teenage daughter Cassie (Freaky's Kathryn Newton) has become a political activist, and is constantly being bailed out of hail; she has become estranged from her father since he is focusing on his celebrity status rather than saving people as Ant-Man. While visiting Hope's parents, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), Cassie reveals that she has been working on a device that can establish contact with the Quantum Realm. She turns it on, but Janet panics and forces it to be shut off. But the message has already been received, and suddenly the portal opens and pulls the five of them into the Quantum Realm. Scott and Cassie are found by natives who are rebelling against their ruler, while Hope, Janet, and Hank explore a large city to find help. Hope, Janet, and Hank meet with Lord Krylar (Bill Murray), formerly an ally of Janet's, he reveals that things have changed since she left. Kang (Jonathan Majors), an exiled traveller Janet previously knew, now known as Kang the Conqueror, has become the ruler of the Quantum Realm, Krylar is working for him now.

O'Brian) that Janet's involvement with Kang is indirectly responsible for his rise to power. Soon, Kang's forces attack them, led by M. O. D. O. K. (Mental Organism Designed Only for Killing), who is revealed to be Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), who survived his apparent death when he was previously Yellowjacket. Aboard Krylar's ship, Janet confesses to Hope and Hank what really happened to her during her time in the Quantum Realm and why she never to return. She found Kang who she assumed was trapped alongside her, he claimed he could help them both escape from the Quantum Realm if she helped him rebuild his power core capable of travelling through the multiverse. After they managed to repair it, Janet touched his chip and had a vision of Kang's true thoughts, planning to conquer and destroy entire timelines. Kang revealed he was exiled by his own variants (versions of himself) who feared him, and Janet turned on him. Janet used her Pym Particles to enlarge the power core and render it unusable. Kang eventually regained his powers and conquered the Quantum Realm some time after; Janet had been fighting him ever since until her rescue. Scott and Cassie are taken to Kang, who threatens to kill Cassie if Scott does not help get his power core back. Scott is taken to the core's location and shrinks down. Scott finds himself surrounded by variants of himself and is almost drowned, bur Hope arrives and helps him acquire the power core. However, Kang goes back on the deal, capturing Janet and destroying her ship. Hank returns, having been rescued by his ants, they were also pulled into the Quantum Realm, they grew in size and rapidly evolved into hyper-intelligent beings; Hank helps Scott and Hope as they make their way to go against Kang. Cassie rescues Jentorra and they commence an uprising against Kang and his army. During the fight, Cassie appeals to Cross's human side that he can change his ways for the better good. Cross is convinced to turn sides and fight Kang, though he sacrifices himself in the process, and dies from his injuries. Janet repairs the power core allowing the group to return home. But while she, Hank, Hope, and Cassie jump through the portal, Kang attacks Scott, nearly beating him into submission. Hope returns to save Scott, together they destroy the power core with a combination of Pym Particles, Kang is knocked into, causing him to be pulled into oblivion. Cassie reopens the portal to return home with Scott. Having returned, Scott resumes his life, he momentarily questions something Kang said about something terrible that will happen, but he brushes it off. In a mid-credits scene, numerous variants of Kang are concerned by the increasing interest in the multiverse on Earth-616 and plan their uprising. In a post-credits scene, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and Mobius M. Mobius (Owen Wilson) locate another Kang variant, named Victor Timely, on Earth in the 1900s. Also starring David Dastmalchian as Veb, William Jackson Harper as Quaz, and Randall Park as Jimmy Woo. Rudd returns as the insect-sized hero with some wisecracks, Lilly is fine as his love interest fellow costumed heroine, Pfeiffer and Douglas have their moments, and Majors is well cast as the villain intent of taking over. The story just about holds up as the characters enter the subatomic universe below our own, the special effects to create the alien creatures and landscapes are brilliant, the fight and chase sequences are suitably exciting, and there are some amusing moments. The multiverse concept means infinite possibilities for where it will go next, this sequel is certainly entertaining, admittedly there is a bit to get your head around sometimes, but overall this is a worthwhile superhero fantasy action.

You certainly developed the piece of communications kit that lands everyone in the quantum soup, but the blame really must go to Peyton Reed and Jeff Loveness for directing and writing this latest emanation from Marvel's increasingly un-special film factory. It starts off with a great little device that could quickly put Papa John's out of business before we are sucked into the cantina from ""Star Wars"" (1977) where our recently arrived travellers find themselves pursued by the ridiculously un-menacing ""M. O. D. O. K"" - a sort of robotic killing version of the golden statue from the top of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981) after it had had a good time with ""V. I. N. C. E. N. T"" from ""The Black Hole"" (1979) - before Michelle Pfeiffer ""Janet"" explains to her family (and to us) just what has led them to a predicament where they must avoid the evil clutches of ""Kang the Conqueror"" (Jonathan Majors). Now this gift that keeps on giving for this studio never struggles to impress visually, and the imagination of those who create these magical effects and alien shapes and sizes must be commended. However, this latest offering featuring, in my view, the weakest of their arsenal of characters is just entirely derivative and unremarkable. Aside from a very few bon-mots from Paul Rudd the dialogue is dry and the action scenes are all concentrated in one or two sequences whilst the rest of this serves as little better than colourful padding for the thinnest of storylines. Rudd is quite an unassuming kind of actor. Engaging, yes - but somehow just too lightweight for the grandness of the surrounding imagery. Michael Douglas (""Pym"") features sparingly and the cameo from Bill Murray might have worked better in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" - here it is almost laughable. If these are to keep coming off the production line as thickly and quickly as seems likely, then somebody somewhere is going to have to spend much more effort on developing stronger and more compelling stories because the audiences are surely immune to the vibrancy of the special effects by now.

","Just got done watching Ant-Man and the Wasp:Quantumania and wanted to give my thoughts on it. First off, this isn't a excellent Marvel film, but it's not a terrible one either. This is a average MCU film to kick off Phase 5 of the MCU and honestly will probably only be remembered for being the start of Phase 5. It was great to see Paul Rudd back as Ant-Man, but I feel some of the source material that was given to him wasn't always the best. Evangeline Lilly as the Wasp was great to see again, but I feel like her character was sidelined for a majority of the film including Michael Douglas as Hank Pym. Both characters have their moments throughout the film that I enjoyed though. The standout characters that carry this movie were definitely Michelle Pfeiffer's Janet Van Dyne and Jonathan Majors Kang the Conqueror. I loved every scene these two characters were in together and loved the chemistry between them as well. It left me wanting more of both of them together. I was also glad to get more of a back story of Janet's time in the quantum realm. Jonathan Majors hands down is Kang the Conqueror and gives this movie his best performance he could possibly give with the source material given to him. The only downside I had with his character, is like Paul Rudd's Ant-Man, not all of the source material given to him was always the best and was disappointing sometimes, but Kang the Conqueror was definitely my favorite character of the entire film. One character I thought that was better than I thought would be due to the other actress who played the character in Avengers: Endgame was recast in this movie was Kathryn Newton as Cassie Lang. I came around and really enjoyed her take on the character. I can't wait to see more of her in the future. The last character that I loved in this movie that I was aware of going into this movie, was gonna be either a love or hate character was M. O. D. O. K. And I absolutely loved this character more than I anticipated too. He had some of the best lines in the film and even though his CGI wasn't always the best, Marvel was able to pull off his character introduction better than I thought they would. When it comes to the tone of the movie, I feel like Marvel copied Star Wars way too much when it came to the source material and it didn't always sit right with me. There are also 2 post credit scenes. The first one honestly in my opinion wasn't a fan of, but the second one has me hyped for what's to come in the future. Overall, this film isn't perfect, but the performances given by Jonathan Majors and Michelle Pfeiffer, make this film worth the watch.

","Paul Rudd is endlessly likeable and Micheal Douglas in this film almost steals the show as the most entertaining character giving him a ""hero"" moment. However those two actors can't help a film that suffers from feeling like you're not really invested due to all the visual effects sure it's in the Quantum Realm a place that doesn't exist but what made Ant-Man quirky and interesting was his grounding in San Francisco with his mates being a low level earth bound hero this film relies too heavily on special effects with an irritation that his mates have been sacrificed for new characters that do little to help us enjoy this story. Perhaps a balance needed to be struck with some of the action between Earth and the quantum realm or less stunt casting for parts that aren't actually necessary. The relationship between Scott and Cassie is fine but most of the time it's Hank that's got the best lines. It won't be one I'll be watching again which seems to be a familiar pattern since Endgame.

","This movie is unjustly maligned by its detractors. It offers a stunning visual representation of the vibrant and strangely beautiful quantum realm. The humor is witty, and the actors deliver convincing performances. Jonathan Majors is outstanding as Kang, a formidable and charismatic villain who sets up the next phase of the MCU. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania had a monumental task of following up the Loki finale and introducing Kang, and it largely accomplishes it. However, it's not flawless. The story feels hasty and superficial at times, and Scott Lang seems like a passive protagonist who lacks agency or growth. I'm not sure how essential this movie is for the overall MCU narrative, but I found it fairly enjoyable.

","I enjoy the MCU movies, especially since technology is now able to match the visions of the worlds and powers of these heroes. My main issue is the writing. I was engaged for at least 20 minutes...then I became frustrated at how every member of this family has some mysterious power. It's bad enough to have to suspend disbelief that practically all of the marvel characters are middle to upper middle class (cultural propaganda here thanks to racism), and possess genius' intelligence, and are able to, by accident or their creation, become super beings whose only goal is to save their family and, oh yeah, the universe from evil. I understand the message, the usual 'heroic' behavior, both athletic and in decisions...'Heavy is the head that wears the crown thing', but for the whole family? That's so lazy. Instead of character development, the writers simply said 'Let's send the message punt and send the message 'To families, you two can save the world...with love, working together for the same goals...yadda, yadda, yadda!' and wrote something that was so sappy and ended so silly, it feel like many of the great actors in the movie were not done justice. Specifically, Pfeiffer, Douglas were very good. Jonathan Majors was great, yet, the writing limited his character and, probably, did him an injustice as an actor. The story and the characters could have been so much more focused. For every i
insurmountable problem, the genius within the heroes find a solution...sometimes by accident, sometimes by luck, but, as with script-writing which requiring the least effort, all problems are solved without a hitch. As I said, we know Kangs character isn't going away thankfully, but, his character was way too strong and too good to be threatened by any of the 'heroes' in this, regardless if they were family. Try finding writers who could offer a better story, with more character development, and provide something less ridiculous. In a more fitting re-phrasing of something W. C. Fields is attributed to have said...'If you can't dazzle them with brilliance, please don't resort to baffling them with bullsh*it. Find those who CAN dazzle them with brilliance.'",/review/rw8876173/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_Quantumania_2023

It doesn't take very long to figure out that this third Ant-Man film is looking to raise the stakes and spectacle with big, broad action scenes and incandescent visual effects, but to put it bluntly it's easy to see that much of the inspiration came from the Star Wars franchise. The jokes don't always land, the callbacks are expected, and it piles on too much sentiment in its latter stages, but there's a good collection of characters that are actually worth caring about, the villain is a formidable one, and it's able to create some anticipation for Phase Five.

This is true for both the MCU and the DCEU, and I've found it works pretty well for me. I followed this same practice with ANT MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA. The story picks up with Scott Lang enjoying life after the events of AVENGERS: EDDGAME (which seem like a long time ago now) reconnecting with his teenage daughter Cassie, romancing Hope Van Dyne (aka The Wasp), and working with her parents, scientists Hank Pym and his wife Janet. Scott's written a book, and is taking to the life of being celebrity. But in short order, Scott and his extended family are shrunk back down into the microverse, a hostile world where they must find a MacGuffin that will return them to their home. They also must keep said MacGuffin from falling into the hands of the story's main villain, Kang the Conqueror, a legacy Marvel bad guy. Kang is a time traveling multi-dimensional tyrant, bent on proving himself against all of existence who was exiled to the Quantum Realm and would very much like to reconnect with Janet who played a very important role preventing him from escaping during the years she spent in the microverse, and who hid the MacGuffin away where Kang couldn't find it. There is much chasing and hiding, capturing and escaping, in the progress of the story, ending in a big set piece battle between good and evil, where the latter is on the verge of destroying all the worlds as we know them if he is not stopped.",/review/rw8876173/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_Quantumania_2023

","Ant-Man 1 and 2 were much better movies for many reasons compared to Ant-Man 3 Quantumania. The first film felt more like a non superhero film with low stakes but still a lot of character building, Scott Lang recently gets out of prison but is trying hard to win back his daughter. The first and second Ant-Man film as laugh out loud funny, and especially the second film which probably is the funniest Marvel superhero movie ever (yes, funnier than Deadpool 1 and 2 which I didn't think were all that funny). The 3rd Ant-Man film was not that funny, though there were a few funny moments but I didn't really laugh out loud, the humor felt more like cartoon humor for children while the previous films were funny for both adults and children alike. Speaking of it being for children, the Ant-Man 3 film felt like it was heavily ""Disneyfied"" with much less violence and the violence seem like it has been toned down, plus there was no kiss at the end when Ant-Man and the Wasp saved the day which made it feel like there's no chemistry between the two. Hope's father, Hank, was barely in the 3rd film, while he was integral in the first two films. The 2nd Ant-Man film had way more action sequence, and the buildup was much better (especially when Hank finally reunites with Janet after like 30 years, getting into the Quantum realm to save her finally, and plus they actually kissed unlike Hope and Scott in Ant-Man 3... so the the love between the characters felt more real in the previous films). The boring thing in Ant-Man 3 is they used the same old trope of inspiring the common folk to rise up and fight back against the oppressors, very similar to many movies like Star Wars, Dune, Lord of the Rings, etc. It just felt outdated for a big movie in 2023. It seems like Disney is going to far with the campiness, just like they did in Thor 4 Love and Thunder which that film and Ant-Man 3 felt like it was a movie mostly meant for kids to watch. I guess it's a money making strategy to make it very family friendly and light hearted but it starts to become stale and people get sick of it. A lot of people diss the DC films like Man of Steel (2013) or Zack Snyder's Justice League saying it's too serious and not funny/campy enough, but looking back, I think people are now realizing that these films have more depth and an artistic feel to it.",/review/rw8876173/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_Quantumania_2023

The visuals are a cacophony of brown shades, the color grading seems ""off"". This was the opportunity to go visually stunning but didn't. I know Luis has no place from a character perspective in the Quantum realm but without the inclusion of his character (maybe playing the earth bound character idk aligning the same machine that sucked the characters up in the first place so they can be sucked through the same entry point) a cool aspect of the story could be that when they leave the quantum realm they don't really leave per say. Since they didn't have Luis telling them go through ""insert nomenclature here"" the characters propel themselves further down in the quantum realm. Instead of exiting they inadvertently go deeper bc they have no one guiding their team from earth.

We all know what the general rule is; the more sequels, the lesser the quality. I personal feel that Marvel usually succeeds at this while most others fail, although there has been several sequels lately that just isn't as good as expected. But still, in my excitement for the third return of one of my favorite Marvel heroes, I was very hopeful for this movie. All in all, it was better than some of the other Marvel sequels I've seen recently and that's mostly because of Paul Rudd and the overall casting of the Ant-Man movies, alongside a well-rounded script that contains both action and comedy. I however was disappointed in the development of Cassie Lang, both the fictional character and the new actress. I loved Cassie in the first two movies and while I realize why they needed an older actress post-Endgame, I still feel they could've done better. I also would've liked to see more of Scott and Hope's romantic relationship, as well as the Lang/Pym/Van Dyne family dynamic. This movie was obviously very much about introducing the Kang character, which I was not impressed with at all.

","I'm not the biggest Ant Man fan and probably never will be, however, I was excited to see the new installment due to the lackluster sequel prior. I gave this film a chance. Marvel has not been releasing the best films lately, but I must say I had a great time watching Quantumanium. It's far from perfect nonetheless. It suffers from pacing issues in the 2 hours and 4minute run. It goes off kind of slow for the first hour and then the last 45 minutes it jumps off the rails. Some of the characters like Michelle Pfieffer and Kat Newtons characters were to be desired. Michelle was instantly badass in some scenes and then reduced to an ant sized supporting character for most of the film. There were also not a ton of jokes for this film is darker in tone, but just like Thor Love and Thunder, when there's a serious situation happening, an unnecessary joke is tossed in there. I also found some of the dialogue to be a bit repetitive. One character would say one thing, another would repeat what they've said as a question, and then its repeated again as an answer. Tons of dialogue fillers. However, despite the flaws, it was fun! I enjoyed it! Paul Rudd and Johnathan Majors delivered stellar performances. The action scenes were very good and well choreographed. Marvel is slowly finding their footing. We can agree to disagree. We're introduced to a villain that is much more of a threat than Thanos could ever be. I just want to see more from him. The Kang in this film was good, more ruthless, but he was pulling his punches in various scenes. The last 30-45 minutes if the movie is where things get really good. Still a mess, but Paul Rudd was no joke handling his own against the almighty Kang himself. Its the grittiness weve gotten from winter soldier and endgame i want to see more of.

For how bad it was, there was apparently a lot of plot and information that had to be rushed through to make it in a shorter time length. Maybe if they had just paced it in a way that doesnt feel like if you blink you no longer understand the entire reason for anything, it would help cover up the other flaws better and make it a movie that is endurable. Another thing that bothered me that seems to be a consequence of the rushed pace was how nobody would explain anything. Even as someone who did watch Loki, I am very confused as to what Kang's goal was and why it was evil. When scott was given the choice to cooperate with Kang or risk his daughters life he hesitated despite not knowing almost anything at all about this guys intentions. If I were in Scott's situation, I may even wonder if he was a good guy, because basically all he said is that he needed to stop something bad from happening. Also, the grandma or whatever her name is was asked so many times what her story is and what was even happening and she was like ""No time to say"" WHEN HER JUST TELLING THEM WOULD SAVE SO MUCH MORE TIME?? I love movies that are confusing and you have no idea what's going on, but knowing that the only reason you dont know is because a character who could very easily just say their story refuses to say it ruins my love for the mystery of it and just makes me so pissed at the character.",/review/rw8876173/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_Quantumania_2023

I'm glad, it was a darker sci-fi tone for the movie. The visual and CGI is great even though a lot of people in this world, will always complain about it for every Marvel movie that has come out. Very good action, laughs and more!! The two credits scene was so good. I can say, that people already watched it and don't like, will regret it when they could bring back a clip from this movie in the future like movie Avengers Kang Dynasty because how important the plot for Kang will be in Kang Dynasty. Just like in Avengers Endgame and they bring scene from Thor Dark World which we can agree it was not good but it's was important to the story that's been told. I personally, really enjoy this movie! I don't know why it's getting a lot of hate...Because, it's really easy to follow. Go Watch It!!!!",/review/rw8876173/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_Quantumania_2023

And now after watching it ... I can assure you it's NOT a bad movie! ...it actually started as a great "" adventure"" movie ... Getting down there and exploring the quantum realm by Scott and the family...it was actually pretty cool.. I swear, I'd rather watch a couple of movies about that instead of the crappy multiverse saga we got lol...It was decent... The side characters were nice... We got close to the family... A lot of the jokes and sarcasm were actually funny and tolerable... And then after being teased the whole time .. Kang ( the conqueror..the names are important here lol ) shows up.. And yup, Jonathan Majors did well... Although I think people are over praising him...sometimes he's a bit over the top and indulging... Yeah it's not thanos's level of charisma and threat.. No, people are just desperate lol...so far the movie is going well.. And THEN.. Oh boy... Just like every other phase 4 project... Now we have to end the movie... That's when logic gets completely shut down.. And all the BS takes over... Kang who was always two steps ahead of his opponent.. Is now literally waiting for everyone to counter his every move and relying on his minions ...the main characters get too op, practically invincible, the classic M-she-U... Male characters get saved by female characters.. Female characters always have the solution for everything....forced humor in what supposed to be epic / sad scenes...until we reach the very end.. and again.. Just like other phase 4 projects... The answer to everything is... THE MULTIVERSE... hey, we killed the bad guy / girl, does that mean we won?.. No, THE MULTIVERSE.. Okay, so when a character dies, are they really dead?.. No, THE MULTIVERSE... Okay, does anything still make any sense at all?... No, THE MULTIVERSE....that's pretty much sums up the botched multiverse saga... The infinity war saga was coherent, well established and well executed... It payed off really well... Infinity war and endgame were peak superhero movie experience ... Dude these days feel so long gone by now 😭😭...phase 4 has been terrible and absolutely has no soul... And based on what the cringey post credit scenes present... Yikes..

The plot follows Ant-Man, his family, and his workers as they become trapped in Quantumania and attempt to escape, only to run into Kang The Conquer. This film provided a massive opportunity for the characters to redeem themselves as they are today, but it failed to do so. The film was predictable and unimpressive. It was building to a peak, leading to another disappointing, predictable ending. Although there were some positive aspects, such as the VFX and editing, it was not a perfect film. In Quantum Realm, the setting is both unsettling and exciting. Paul Rudd does an excellent job as Ant-Man. He expresses his love for Cassie as he is compelled to complete a mission to restore time to spend more time with her but is misled by deception. His performance adds a lot to the film and elevates it. If you are a Marvel fan, you should see this film since it continues the storyline that began with Kang The Conquer.

Janet Van Dyne played by Michelle Pfiffer was also underwhelming, as she showed little emotion during lines, and I failed to feel any kind of connection to the character. On a more positive note, Paul Rudd's humor was absolutely off the charts (as it was in every other performance I've seen him in). Jonathan Majors delivered, by far the greatest performance, as most of his lines are composed of philosophical ideas, and made me question who was right and who was wrong. Kang The Conquerer will become an interesting and conflicted moralist in the MCU. Obviously it was great to see Bill Murray as Lord Krylar. The overall plot was very weak, recycling over used plot points from other Marvel films. That is until the gears shift during the middle, when more of Kang's backstory is explained. If you're a Marvel fan, or at least genuinely interested in the MCU, It's definitely worth checking out. My opinion will probably change in due time, but as of right now 6/10.",/review/rw8876173/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_Quantumania_2023

Jonathan Majors is incredible as Kang, who, although he doesn't have all the leading role expected of him, fulfills his character very well and I hope to see him in action in the future. Kathryn Newton is a good change from the Cassie actress who has a good performance and a lot of lead alongside Jannet who plays a very important role in the film: Paul Rudd executes his character well in which he realizes that he does not spend much time with his daughter, and is forced to work with Kang to have a way out of the quantum realm. There are characters that do not have as much prominence as expected and that in themselves do not contribute much to the plot and some only serve as a fun element.

","I would like to take a different point of view towards the problems surrounding the new Marvel movies. Here's the thing, I think the main issue that is causing such disappointments for fans regarding the recent movies is not technical. I don't deny the bad CGI or editing and directing problems, but, the big issue is with the overall storytelling. If you take a good look at each phase and each Saga of the MCU you can kinda look at it as a TV show for which each of the phases act as a season and each of the Saga as a whole show. Storytelling is a vital aspect of any good show. In order to create the best villain, you need appropriate and proper build up. The said build up will probably require to include many side stories which seem to be irrelevant but are portrayed in an interesting way for their own sake. Let me clarify. The first Saga of the MCU was the Infinity Saga which included three phases and Thanos was the ultimate vilain for it. If my calculations are correct, the character had his own movie after 18 others. We repeatedly saw traces of the Infinity stones in those movies and as a result they became a great mystery for us and left a mark in our minds. Therefore, when we finally got to know what exactly they were and how the great villain is going to use them and even what the point of all the chaos around them was, our excitement was beyond imagination. Besides that, we got to know our heroes very well on the ride. In the end we knew everything about them and felt everything they felt because of all the adventures we experienced with them.

","This movie does a lot of things wrong but I feel like it's showing how the new disney is just fighting itself now. The movie starts okay with a lil Paul Rudd narration, it quickly goes down hill when we meet Cassie Lang, and realize that his daughter has turned into a pretentious, virtue signaling, privelged, and ungrateful criminal. Then the movie bad mouths Ant-Man as he has become a guy who just saved the world but hasn't been doing his due diligence to help the most marginalized of society. We then learn about the quantum realm and the character Janet starts to take over as the annoying hero who could just explain the situation to everyone but instead says ""Trust Me"", ""There's no time"", and other classic cliches of this annoying archetype. Ant-Man and the Wasp (Title Characters) take a back seat to Cassie and Janet as they go on their own Rick and Morty rip off of an adventure. Cassie and Scott are captured by a group of characters who we are supposed to grow attached to but since we only have about 5 minutes to try and do that while learning very little about any of them, they more just become side characters that aren't given much purpose. Janets story has a good Bill Murray cameo, Hank and the Wasp might as well not have been there as they contributed nothing. The best part about this movie is Kang, the all powerful time traveler still has a very disappointing part in this movie but he starts strong although he ends quite weak. Kang and Modok are probably tied when it comes to building up a powerful character who does nothing meaningful with that power at all. After hearing Kangs backstory and meeting him we understand that he is the new Thanos. We also find out MODOK (Iconic Marvel Villain) is just Yellowjacket (Darren) from the first Ant-Man and instead of making him the super weapon with a giant brain that he is supposed to be he becomes the ridiculous character that is hard to look at or take seriously at all.",/review/rw8876173/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_Quantumania_2023

748,17 February 2023,GusherPop,10," Best MCU movie Since Endgame.
","All that is out the window with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, the third entry in the series and the first to kick off an MCU phase instead of capping one. Not only does director Peyton Reed's movie take place almost exclusively in the Quantum Realm (exploring it much more extensively than ever before), but it also puts Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and company up against the next major Marvel menace: Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), a power-mad tyrant who can move through all of space and time. He threatens not just ""our"" reality, but every other one out there. Most of the film takes place at a far remove from the Marvel Universe we know, down in the subatomic Quantum Realm that characters from previous films have visited (Ant-Man), gotten stuck in for decades (Ant-Man and the Wasp) or used as a series of temporal highway bypasses on their way to saving the universe (Avengers: Endgame). Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania has just enough entertaining moments and a heartfelt family story, plus knockout performances in Michelle Pfeiffer's Janet van Dyne and Jonathan Majors' Kang the Conqueror, to make up for its more underdeveloped aspects. The exploration of its central themes, new characters, and the Quantum Realm itself only goes skin deep, leaving it feeling high on spectacle but low on substance. Even so, Quantumania works as a culmination of the Ant-Man series, a way to start things in motion for Phase 5, and a promising roadmap of where the Multiverse Saga is going. Of course, many MCU fans may wait and see what audience scores are like. Generally speaking, audience scores trend higher than critics for most superhero offerings, and I would probably expect that to be the case here. But I would be surprised if this was a huge disparity as this always seemed like a pretty risky film. I also think it may be worth noting that so many new Marvel films keep popping up in the bottom ten here, like the even higher profile Thor: Love and Thunder and Multiverse of Madness. The MCU does feel like it's has its magic in phase 4 here. Serenely untroubled by pressures to break box office records or win Oscars, the Ant-Man films seem content to be clever entertainments with heart, but not so much that they become cloying. From the size jokes to the running gags to the casting of Rudd, who has spent his career behaving as if he's a random regular guy who stumbled into stardom and finds it all quite silly, the series manages to be light but not inconsequential, whether a given scene is sentimental (anything involving Scott and Cassie) or cheerfully deranged (the climatic fight at the end of the first movie atop a Thomas the Tank Engine train set). Ant-Man is officially a member of the MCU's starting lineup, the Avengers, but feels like a replacement player who gets a text when Thor calls in sick. This new movie validates Scott's not-quite-insecurity (he's not deep enough to be existentially tormented) by having him get mistaken for other superheroes. He takes it in stride. Two films ago, he got fired from Baskin-Robbins, and before that, he was in jail. Happiness, like size, is a matter of perspective.",/review/rw8876173/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_Quantumania_2023

","That movie lost what was great about the first two Ant-Man movies..........which is that it's a story about a guy trying to make amends. Here's another saving the world. It's so empty that I think: Isn't the time when Marvel TOP was gone? It's not just the problem of the last Ant-Man, but of the entire Multiverse saga. Doctor Strange 2 was rushed, Thor became a parody of himself, and the third Ant-Man became another world-saving figure of the dozen. Where is the difference? Hell, the first Ant-Mans were about family and self-righteousness and didn't need another intergalactic threat. And even Doctor Strange 2 and Thor 4 (although it didn't really suit me) had at least some author's imprint. Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania, on the other hand, is the essence of cinematic emptiness.

Going back to the beginning of the franchise over a decade ago with Iron Man, Thor, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America: The First Avenger, and their culmination in The Avengers, it all felt special. Yes, after that there were a few stumbles with Thor: The Dark World (which I still mildly enjoy) and Iron Man 2 (which I think gets a worse rap than it deserves), but I've always at the very least thought their projects were anywhere from fine to fantastic. Well, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania has now hit theatres and after 41 projects, this is the first one I have straight-up disliked.

","Ant-Man The Wasp Quantumania is the third installment in the series and the kick-off of Phase 5 of the MCU. Scott after saving the world seems to be getting back to his life with Thanos. Wrote a book, was treated like a hero by the public and still trying to make up lost time with his Daughter. The whole family are shown Cassie and Hank have been working on a project involving the Quantum realm and receive signal, but after a mishap, they all get sucked into the realm and have to now find a way home while also dealing with an interdimensional tyrant Kang the Conqueror. Quantumania in many ways is more the typical Marvel Formula with poor visual effects and unwarranted humor. Overall It's more of a film that's only purpose is to set up further events as opposed to having a fun self-contained story. In the long run, it serves no purpose outside of introducing moviegoers to Kang. The first 35 minutes of the film are almost pointless showing Scott, hope, and all of them and showing that Scott has a separation between himself and Cassie, but it doesn't set up much in terms of development. As soon as they hit the Quantum Realm that is thrown away in favor of just showing off the realm. Honestly, it is not all that interesting. As opposed to Doctor Strange's. This is CGI Splattered all over the Screen that is devoid of much in terms of life. You have no idea how this world works. You micro people living here some that look human others that look like blobs and all amounts strange designs. There's a rebel group, not a single thing you will know about them. Yet you suppose to care about them being free from Kang. The World's forgettable as for the main cast most of them are boring and outraged. A huge issue with Ant-Man and The Wasp was that Scott was reduced to an idiot while the focus was primarily going to hope. Here He kinda takes a backstage again, this time by Michelle Pfeiffer who is a talent and actress, even though it is poorly written why she doesn't tell anyone about Kang. Hope does very little in the majority of the film and Michael Douglas is just there. His big moment comes near the end and it's really stupid the explanation. As for the villains, The Highlight is Jonathan Majors as Kang When he's introduced, it's almost like you entered a different movie, and while it shows potential for this character. He also has its weak points, because given the stern serious tone he goes with it just stands out that this wasn't the right film for him to debut with all this marvel humor and just undermines him in the end. He also does suffer from the fact that they explain just the basic of who he is without going into depth. Modok is just stupid and yes he's look is a little stupid in the comics with the huge head and baby legs, but still has an opposing monster look to him. Here it's just silly and everything he does is just silly it's not even Modok they just recycle the previous villain's yellowjacket.

As a lifetime marvel comics fan, and to understand that Ant-Man is not even sidekick worthy in comic books growing up, Ant-Man is a fringe, not very well-thought-of character historically. The MCU tried to build up this character because they didn't have licensing rights to the X-Men, Fantastic 4, Ghost Rider, and many other mainstream characters, so they were trying to build out the rest of the universe with characters where the rights were not sold. This is like a CW network production of ""my little pony"" and ""hello kitty"" teaming up and saving the universe. Taking Ant-Man and making it an essential element for phase 4 and beyond as a macro theme for anybody who is a true fanboy of the material is insane. Kang the Conqueror is an Apex predator Thanos-level villain. Having Janet Van Dyne Defeat him twice and relegate him to the quantum realm and beyond is ridiculous.

Like it forgot Scott's friends from the two previous films. Bill Murray could have appeared later in the film, like have him be MODOK's immediate supervisor.

","Was really hyped for this one, the start of phase 5 and kicking it off with a finally serious ant-man movie with Kang! I was most excited for Kang in this one and I got what I wanted so I'm happy. Ant-Man getting a serious movie was very different but really cool to see him taking a situation fully seriously in his own movie. Modok is in this movie and I know Modok from the shows and comics so his look I knew it would look odd as it's hard to pull that off in love action and take it seriously but I'm happy with what they did with the design, also all the jokes with him when he died and in general were hilarious. Cassie Lang is all grown up and gets some screen time, she had a cute relationship with her dad but apart from that I didn't get super excited for her, or any other characters besides Ant-Man and Kang really. Ant-Man you get to see at his peak of sorts with him fully capable of using his powers and able to grow to immense sizes, he held his own in this movie too with a brutally cool fight scene. My main takeaway and what this movie was truly about though was Kang and thank god cause I love Kang! His attitude and personality showing how cunning, dangerous and intelligent he is makes me even more into him as a character. Love the design of the suit and seeing what he is capable of. All the lore for Kang too and the multiverse war I ate up! Loved it loved it loved it! It's just the way he operates that makes him so badass! Unfortunately when he died (I think) I was like damn that sucks I loved that variant but the end credits with the council of Kangs!!! YES! Can't wait to see them all and more Kang screen time, love that character. I got a tiny bit annoyed at how often the characters removed their helmets purely just to not hide the stars faces which happened a lot but it's not a massive issue. Overall I enjoyed Ant-Man mostly for Kang (I'm saying Kang a lot whoops) but he was really such a rich character to dive into so I'm glad there was a lot of that.",/review/rw8876173/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_Quantumania_2023

Oh hey, let's have some snappy dialogue right before someone tries to kill us, and hey, let's happily hug and high five right after because we were so scared. I never felt one ounce of desperation or inspiration throughout, they were all phoning it in. And as far as introducing the new big, bad guy? What a letdown. I actually chuckled a little at the visuals of all of the versions of him breaking free because I felt no dread at all in thinking about where they were going or what they were going to do.

And sure, you could argue that this variant of him is weaker or restricted due to him being exiled, but even still, his technology is so powerful, so far beyond what we have on earth, he has telekinesis, he can create shields, he can incinerate beings, shoot lasers, amongst other crazy feats.

","Ant man and the wasp quantamania is a big step up from previous two films in trilogy, it sets up future of MCU's Multiverse saga meanwhile providing a good entertainment.. Visuals were great, story was good , action scenes were enjoyable everyone delivered a great performance especially Majors as KANG THE CONQUEOR, Paul Rudd was also great as ant man like previous mcu apperances.. It had some pacing issues but an epic 3rd act makes up for everything.. Final battle was really amazing and was on a big scale it also had some tense moments.. There is also a little bit of comedy, some good jokes.. Overall film is great which concludes this trilogy in a small big way meanwhile setting up stages for mega event movies AVENGERS THE KANG DYNASTY and AVENGERS SECRET WARS.. This film also acts as an introduction of Kang who is the main big bad of phase 5.... In last I want to say you can enjoy this film in cinema as an fun superhero action adventure movie featuring our favorite Marvel heroes and villains you won't be dissapointed especially young kids will enjoy this film very much...

A sequel buffered with a few extra supporting cast and very lame development of challenges in core bulk of movie. Some brief and interesting visuals with similarities to Valerian and Avatar and Xmen. The script lacks any real suspense or action and does not leave you feeling the Ant man plot has been explored and developed quite as eloquently as Thor or Iron Man movies. Overall worth a viewing just to see how Ant man evolves in the so called Marvel universe. The introduction of a new villain in the marvel universe does leave a number questions and clues which tie in with Dr Strange , so doesn't leave a great deal of imagination on where a sequel might lean towards.

The story was kind of all over the place, but at the same time, it was simple enough to follow. The best part of the movie was definitely Kang. Jonathan Majors delivered a great performance and every scene that he was in was great. Looking forward to seeing more of the character in the future. Kind of disappointed with M. O. D. O.

Standards were set pretty high with movies like Infinity War and Endgame and from that moment there were not a move that left me speachless and hyped the way I want to be after watching Marvel. Thematic and side characters are something we saw many times in previous movies, we need something new, refreshing, not jokes like having a guy who looks like broccoli.

MODOK easily fell short of who he is in the comics and they filled him with half witted jokes and boring dialogue. This was not Modok. This is the mcu's Yellowjacket as a baby, so do the fans a favor and fix that. In the long run, Thanos is about 0 threat compared to what's coming of Kang. The heroes will have a run for their money and please marvel please. Kill your heroes. Have the stakes raised. Kang should dominate the screen as he's dominated comic book panels for years and years.

Paul Rudd was able to show his dynamic range here playing it funny initially but taking serious to the max when threatened by Kang.. Majors did an Outstanding job with Kang""s character,
whether it was the subtle facial mannerisms or the downright stone cold shift in tone from friendly to someone who would crush the universe and think nothing of it..The guy Made this movie..His performances stood out and elevated the storyline into a seriously awesome one...I only hope future appearances of the Kang character are as intense and terrifying and well acted as he was in this movie...The scenery was incredible to watch and extremely creative in design ...This is a very good scfi adventure,if you like a little humor very lightly mixed into an eye popping ride that is dark,intense and thrilling at times...This is Not another gooey mess like the recent Thor movie...

Jonathan Majors was phenomenal as Kang, the visual effects were visually stunning (most of the time), and Cassie was a surprisingly interesting character. Where this movie lacks for me, its plot and pacing, also the ending, but this is a spoiler free review. The plot isn't that interesting, so it fails to grab the viewers undivided attention. The pacing is jumbled and some of it felt forced, movie had no business being 2 hours long. In all honesty it felt unfinished, but yet this movie is incredibly important to the future of the MCU, so therefore it is a must see. As a standalone Ant-man, it's the best one. As a MCU movie following movies such as Spider-man No Way Home and Doctor Strange's Multiverse of Madness, this movie falls incredibly short.

Point is that I am a person who will live and die by marvel. I genuinely that this is a positive step for Marvel. Marvel is starting to seriously branch out from the comics and is making it's own story. For past films, the stories have been loosely based on issues and series. Now the audience is thrown headfirst into a wacky yet deeply terrifying world. The performances for the movie are phenomenal, Kathrine Newton has seriously improved since her mediocre performance in Detective Pikachu. The movie is visually pleasing, and seems like it would be a fever dream to watch while inebriated. I noticed that there were many reviews commenting on the graphics, which astounded me because the set is gorgeous and so are the characters, well most of them. I can only think that the graphics related reviews are talking about MODOK. I agree that I am not a fan of the skin design and the bulbous stretched face. But I think that it was a creative design and they made jokes about it in the film, almost like he is supposed to look awful. I think that if this is what the MCU looks like, I am fully ready to support it. All that said, I do not believe that this is the best MCU film, but it is far from the worst.

","The movie is mind-blowing, fantastic and has all the elements that fans need. Marvel is growing up with a very large scale. Every characters have their own presence. KANG the conqueror is the peak of the movie. Jonathan majors is so versatile. Don't trust critics review. The experience you will get is beyond any critics point of view. Finally the mid and post credit scenes are icing on the cake. Definitely a fest for audiences after a long long time. An insane build-up to the MCU phase 5.

CGI is top notch and all the different creative imaginative creatures are just stunning. Someone went to a LOT of detail here. Some are just plain weird. Bill Murray in it is a great addition too. Plot is awesome and quite possibly this new villain is far more dangerous than Thanos ever was!!! He's quite a viscous villain more so than Thanos. So they've set the universe up to deal with this new multiverse threat which is great.

The visuals in the Quantum Realm were truly breathtaking, and made it worth the price to see it IMO. The script is what you'd expect for Ant-Man, but Khang's storyline is an nice plot twist that certainly kicks things up a notch. The cut-scenes in the end tie-it into the universe, which is what makes Marvel Studios so good as what they do: they create continuity in movies as well as they do in comics. Something no one else has done as well or as lucratively to date.",/review/rw8876173/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_Quantumania_2023

","I didn't see it in theaters because I am fine watching movies at home. I thought the story was better than expected from other reviews. More development of the Kang backstory from Wasp would have been helpful in understanding which Kang was the antagonist and what his goal was. They showed some of it without storytelling, and that didn't work well without explaining through narration. It was visually well done, and the acting was consistent with the other Antman movies. When Hank Pym was showing off his experiments in his lab is another scene that could have used more narration to set up the final scene.",/review/rw8876173/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_Quantumania_2023

","Kang is a force to be reckoned with. His story and introduction is very intriguing. I actually enjoyed MODOK and what they did with his character. People are bashing him about his looks but he's supposed to be weird and funny looking. I thought the cgi was pretty good compared to other recent mcu entires. This movie is very fun to watch, lots of people were laughing in the theater with me, but that didn't take away from its emotional tones. This move had some serious steaks and had restored my faith in Marvel again. I got some Star Wars vibes, specifically episode 9 but executed very well. Paul Rudd was brilliant as always and Ant-Man's suit in this movie was particularly cool, just looks wise, it's my favorite. And post credit scenes have got me curious on what the mcu has in store next. Highlights: Paul Rudd's hilarious as always but with some serious and good action scenes, Kang is just awesome, the quantum realm has never felt cooler than this, so much to see. Don't listen to critics and ratings, watch it for yourself and form your own opinion. My local theater gave out free posters that i immediately hung in my room, and the back had the poster for Guardians 3 which I can flip over to when that comes out.

However this movie delivers in every aspect... I've never felt as emotional about a movie since maybe Daredevil (2003) and Oz (2013). I think what truly made this film so breathtakingly amazing and wholeheartedly inspiring is the mix of draw-jopping action with a sort of an oaky afterbirth of a beautifully written plot. M. O. D. O. K. Is without a doubt the greatest superhero character I've ever had the pleasure to view in cinemas, he is simply too hot to not arrive for.

I see this as genius as they taked a character from Loki and maked another version of him. Then out him in Antman. Also at the end of Quantumania we see after the Texts a video where is loki and Mobius Looking at Kang/The one who remains. This confirms my theory.",/review/rw8876173/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_Quantumania_2023

","Ok, look i have never reviewed a movie on imdb but when i see the insane amount of negative reviews i just had to. This has to be one of my favorite marvel movies of all time. I went to see it expecting dissapointment due to the amount of negative reviews it has. But man was i blown away by how fun this movie was. From the very start i was engaged and sat in suspense at what is coming next. The locations during this movie looked very good. Jonathan Majors acting is incredible and terrifying, and him playing Kang was just meant to be. Kang is my new favorite villain and my favorite character of the MCU alongside Loki. Yes, it has some plotholes but EVERY marvel movie does, and for me it made sense to the extent where i can see where phase 5/6 is going. It seems like people have forgotten what a good marvel movie looks like.",/review/rw8876173/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_Quantumania_2023

","This was a fantastic entry into the next MCU phase. Jonathan Majors plays a phenomenal Kang- despite whatever legal troubles he's enmeshed in, and whether he's innocent or guilty - the rage and betrayal and hurt and menace that he puts into this character, it's difficult to picture any other known actor doing such a job. I've known folks to complain about the story and the CGI here. But they need to stop comparing every new MCU product to Endgame and Infinity War. This is an overall excellent entry into the Kang story arc for anyone willing to give it an honest shake.",/review/rw8876173/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_Quantumania_2023
1345,16 February 2023,marashianbehnam-23780,10," As a science fiction fan, this is a great sequel to the first two Ant-Man movies.
","Impressive visual effects, cool technology, fun action sequences and hilarious gags. This Ant-Man sequel had it all. I'm a science fiction fan, and yet this movie is truly enjoyable. Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michelle Pfeiffer, Kathryn Newton, Jonathon Majors, Tony McCarthy, Bill Murray, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Peña, Michael Douglas, Randall Park, William Jackson Harper, Hannah John-Kamen, Walton Goggins, David Bertucci, Bobby Cannavale, David Dastmalchian, Judy Greer, Corey Stoll, Wood Harris, Sean Kleier, Gregg Turkington, Katy M. O'Brian, Ruben Rabasa and Patton Oswalt all played their roles very well. What a great MCU movie.",/review/rw8876173/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_Quantumania_2023
1346,18 February 2023,broshrimp,9," Just need more Wasp please
","I had a good time with this film. Beautiful skyboxes, Rudd being funny, Lilly being sexy. Majors as Kang is vicious and terrifying, Ant Man really makes the hero turn in this film leading into Phase 5 and 6, with guest appearances by Stinger and M. O. D. O. K.. Really has a 5-8 issue comic book arc feel, jumping right into the action, while managing to do a lot of world building. I only wish there was more Wasp action in this film, but there was enough. Can never get enough an og leader of the Avengers though. Can't wait to see more Ant Man vs Kang.",/review/rw8876173/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_Quantumania_2023
1347,25 May 2023,adamianwebb,9," Definitely Worth A Watch, Despite Overwhelmingly Negative Reviews
","A very entertaining film. Ant-Man is often seen as a lesser/less interesting character compared to some of the bigger superheroes in the Marvel domain, but Paul Rudd and the rest of the cast and the crew have certainly elevated his standing in my opinion. I wish I made the time to see it in the cinema.",/review/rw8876173/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_Quantumania_2023

","Wow!! Ok so this was a pretty good entry into the MCU. I know the critics on RT hit it hard and I'm sure some fans will feel the same. But considering how Phase 4 landed I actually found this movie to be a breath of fresh air. It's very much like a Sci-fi movie and very different than many MCU movies but I didn't mind that at all. It does feel like a combination of other sci-fi films like Star Wars, again not a problem for me personally.",/review/rw8876173/?ref_=tt_urv,AntMan_and_the_Wasp_Quantumania_2023
