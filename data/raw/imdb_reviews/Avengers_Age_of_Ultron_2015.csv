","In 2012, there came a day unlike any other day where the worlds greatest heroes were united against a common threat and THE AVENGERS blew away audiences of all ages with the first ever comic book movie crossover. In 2015, there came another day unlike any other day and this time the world is threatened by a Ultron, the cynical critical atypical child of Skynet and Megatron...... No actually he's just a wisecracking artificial intelligence with delusions of godhood and all round evil. Turning on his creators, he threatens all life on earth with his sidekicks ""illusion- woman"" and ""not-the-flash""....I mean, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, and it is up to the Avengers to take him out before he can usher in THE AGE OF ULTRON.

","This film isn't nearly as bad as some people make it out to be. While the story isn't as good as the first Avengers, the acting is still just as good, the action is even better, and Ultron isn't a bad villain, he's just an under-developed one. Honestly, the action makes up for most of the flaws of this movie and it also set up a lot of MCU films, or at least foreshadowed a lot. Movies like Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War/Endgame, and Captain America: Civil War. Overall, this isn't a bad film, at all, but it is the weakest of The Avengers franchise.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

I thought the plot of needing to stop a ultra peace keeping robot from trying to make the human race extinct for peace was really good, and I think James Spader did a great job playing the role. I also liked the story of the movie to go along with it. Another thing I liked was that we were introduced to Wanda and Pietro Maximoff (Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver). I also though the acting from Elisabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson was great. It sucks we had to lose Pietro, he didn't even need to die, I feel the writers were just looking for a reason to write home out. I also liked how we got a little look into the future of the franchise with the Avengers trip to Wakanda.

The first Avengers movie proved itself able to carry the weight of such challenge, and came out successful in delivering one the most poignant superheroic tales ever told. This year, AGE of ULTRON blasts into cinemas carrying the load of mammoth anticipation. While it is expected to perform better—if not as well as the previous release—it will not be totally surprising, and will still be forgivable, if it falls just a feet beneath the staggering anticipation.

48,29 April 2015,ironhorse_iv,8," This uncanny movie directed by Joss Whedon is still pretty marvelous.
","When the Walt Disney Company purchase Marvel Studios in 2009; there was lots of doubts that story of the Avengers comics book, could ever be put on screen, and make sense to non-comic book readers. Marvel Studios, somehow pull it off, with the Phase One film campaign. From 2008 to 2012, the first set of movies introduces the core main characters of the Avengers superhero group, such as Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), and Captain America (Chris Evans), one by one. All this work in creating a Marvel Cinematic Universe, leaded to 2012's megahit, The Avengers, which compare all these characters into one film. Once again, Marvel Studios is trying to recapture the magic, by launching Phrase 2, which focuses on even more new characters, while exploiting the establish characters in solo missions type films. Most of those films, kinda work, as they help push the Infinity Stones storyline even more, while showing the breakdown of establish agency groups, such as S.H.I.E.L.D. When Marvel Studios once again, wanted to bring back Avengers, back together, it brought all types of sub-plot storyline back into one film. Sadly, in my opinion, Avengers 2: Age of Ultron doesn't really connect that well, with the other previous solo films. The film left a lot of the previous films plot-holes, unexplained and continue to make it, wider, with even more confusing, rush subplots. It kinda felt, like the movie was repeating itself, more than often. While, the movie does bring new light into the main characters dark gritty back stories, the main plot is pretty generic. Instead, of aliens trying to destroy the world, it is robots leaded by Ultron (Voiced by James Spader). The whole idea of the Avengers bringing Vision (Paul Bettany) to life, to protect the world, comes out of nowhere and seem kinda forced. Also, I didn't like how the Vision look. He look kinda stupid due to the costume changes. He looks a robot made out of Starbursts. Other than that, visually, this movie directed by Joss Weldon is amazing to watch. It had tons of great action pack scenes, but the writing would need, some work. The ""story telling"" in this movie is practically non-existent. The movie is nothing more than a giant action sequence sprinkled with what passes as dialogue in between. The humor was alright for the most part. The acting, throughout the film is pretty good. It was a bit weird, seeing Tony Stark in the Iron Man suit, because he destroy most of his technology in the end of 2013's Iron Man 3. Robert Downey Jr is indeed Iron Man. It would be, hard to replace him. I really hope, they will be able to keep, Downey aboard, until 2019's Avengers Infinity Wars are over. Chris Evans is everybody favorite Boy Scout, and he continues to make Captain America, seemed new. I love, how, the movie is settling up, the events between him and Stark, leading to 2016's Captain America: Civil War. It looks great. Chris Hemsworth as Thor, honed this part. I just didn't like his little sub mission. It didn't bring anything new to the table. I like, that Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) is given, more depth. The whole romantic subplot, of Bruce Banner AKA Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) & Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) seem odd. It was a mixed bag for me. I like, the whole Red Room exposition scene, but I really didn't buy, into Natasha having a thing for Banner, after having flings with both Captain America & Hawkeye in the previous films. Still, both of their acting is pretty well-done. The villains are pretty good. James Spader is amazing as Ultron. He has the right amount of wit and smarts, to play a convincing robotic megalomaniac. I really didn't like the changes, they did to the character origins, but I was willing to go with it. New characters like Elizabeth Olsen as the Scarlet Witch was really needed. She pretty own it. I really didn't mind, Aaron- Taylor-Johnson as Quicksilver, but it was kinda a disappointment. Evan Peters did a better job in 20th Century Fox's version of Quicksilver in 2014's X-Men: Day of Future Past. I really thought, that having Quicksilver in this Marvel Studios film, was very pointless, and I was somewhat right. I really had, no strong emotion ties with Aaron's version of character. Both Baron Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann) & Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) seem like a waste. I hate to see them as half-baked, side villains. Still, it's nice to see Andy Serkis, not in a motion-capture type role. Also, look forward to the Stan Lee's cameo. The ending action scene to the film was kinda disappointing due to how outlandish, it was. It was simply impossible for the sequel to recapture the magic of seeing Earth's Mightiest Heroes assembled on screen for the first time, especially when they've popped up in each others' movies in the ensuing years and the overuse of trailers spoiling way too much of the film. Still, as far as second installments go- it was alright. It was good popcorn fun. It's a solid and entertaining follow-up. The post-credits scene wasn't anything, worthy to wait for. The music was kinda underwhelming. Wish, the music had the same tone of the first film. Overall: The film was OK. It easily fulfilled and the exceeded most of my expectations. It's time to assemble again and go see this movie. You wouldn't regret it! I do recommended, seeing this sequel.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

54,20 March 2016,Ziya90,1," The director couldn't catch the achievement of the first
","The Avengers Age of Ultron starts out with a soulless and pointless action sequence and the rest of the movie is not much different than this part. Since we don't know our heroes fight for who and why, we don't get excited for the adventure that our heroes have. Then, somehow, the cinematography is lifeless, the technical craftsmanship accomplishment is boring. Everything is too mechanic here. The villain of the movie is an artificial intelligence, again ""mechanic"". Everything about this villain is so cliché from his words to his evil plans to destroy the world, humanity, whatever. In the first movie, almost everything was perfect. This second installment is lack of heart and soul and an exciting adventure. The movie was like an empty roller coaster ride. The action and the fight scenes are uninspiring, lifeless. Everything happens just so quickly and it is overblown. Another thing the movie was lack of is the tension or clash between the allies. What makes the first movie spectacular was the sweet conflicts among the heroes. Returning to Ultron, it was not intimidating, not hilarious like Loki, honestly, it is just a machine! (Terminator fans, please don't be offended, this is a different case) In contrast with the promises by the director, this is not a darker movie. This is a boring action film. For example, adding romance into a movie doesn't make it deeper or sophisticated. Action is soulless and completely forgettable here except for two scenes. The first and the best is Hulk vs. Hulbuster scene which was fairly done. I have seen it dozens of times. The second one is the highway chase with Captain America and Black Widow, but it was like a copy of The Matrix Reloaded and nothing new. From the beginning, I don't like the appearance or the manners of this new Hulk (the first is favorite), but Hulk is OK here. The second half of the movie focuses on destruction like Man of Steel in a bad way. Do you want to hear Iron Man's witty comments? Thor's majesty? Captain America's work discipline? Hulk's anger? None of them is here. Loki? I miss him. Unfortunately, Quicksilver loses the game from the first minute, because we had seen a brilliant Quicksilver before. Scarlett Witch bewitched me, but I just couldn't get warm to her. I hope I will start to love her in future installments. Vision was completely unnecessary. Hulk is not like a gorilla or a fun mascot here which is good, but he is used like a pawn in this movie. Finally, Age of Ultron is sometimes dreadful, sometimes cheesy, sometimes dull, sometimes pretentious and mostly soulless sequel. I am very happy that the next adventures are going to be directed by Russo Brothers who gave us terrific ""The Winter Soldier"".",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

It's meant to save the world but things go wrong and now they have to get every avenger and more people to stop Ultron. First off, Age Of Ultron was amazing and blew the first avengers out of the water. Everything was more fun, and raised the stakes to a whole another level. Now, there are some parts of the movie that felt not needed for this movie but you know that it will become a bigger piece in the MCU. What makes age of Ultron great as the first one is seeing all the avengers together. The old cast is great as before and with the addition of the new characters, it's just better. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were great additions to the MCU. The one person who stole the whole movie was Hawkeye. He had a lot more screen time and much more character development.

Coming off of the first Avengers film, sure this is a step down, but Age of Ultron is still full of solid action, good humor, and amazing superhero synergy.
Even with the new additions, Paul Bettanys Vision, Elizabeth Olsen's Wanda Maximoff, and James Spaders Ultron, this movie does an amazing job of meshing all these new characters in with the old.
Ultron in this movie felt like another Mandarin (Iron Man 3). But in my opinion, the change of character and James Spaders voice acting works amazingly for this character and makes him extremely memorable.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

Whedon, previously creator of such classic TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, and Firefly, is such an expert of mixing genres that it's easy to take him for granted now but he still has some surprises in how he still puts it all together. Like the fate of one of the superhero characters, for instance. It's so awesome seeing Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hawkeye, The Hulk, and the Black Widow fighting side-by-side once again saving the world! Oh, and yes, Stan Lee does another of his awesome cameos saying something he's famous for this time!

","I enjoyed watching this film, but I have to say the first one was better. That is to be expected I guess, as it was the first time something of that scope had been attempted and all the lead up to the film with the other films. This one, just kind of felt almost episodic rather than being an epic film. Basically, as if it was a television series rather than a full length feature film I paid money to see with some very overpriced snacks from the concession stand. Even the film quality looked sub par at times as it looked kind of drained of color. I knew I was probably not going to enjoy this one as much as the first due to the main villain being Ultron as he is not a favorite of mine. I just do not see him as being that big a threat seeing as how I have a comic where Spider-man takes him down. However, that is not the only reason I feel this film underwhelms, it is just a bit hard to explain. Overall, I did enjoy the film as there was a bit more action than the previous film and there was some cool stuff going on, but like I said, something about it was off.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

I don't go to movies to over-analyze and critique every little detail. I go to the movies to have fun. I love how they set this up on Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and then the movie picks up right where the episode leaves off. I like that they had Robert Downey Jr. go back to being the charismatic, wisecracking Tony Stark that made the first Iron Man film so cool. The running gag with Captain America objecting to the rest of the crew using bad language was hilarious. The visual effects were amazing in 3-D. My favorite was the return of the S.H.I.E.L.D. Heli-carrier. Hawkeye having a wife and kids was a nice surprise. As far as the whining goes about Black Widow taking a back seat to the rest of the guys, I really didn't see it that way. The Avengers are a team. They fight together. I didn't really see any one Avenger in the movie outshining the rest of the group. While all the focus was on Widow, they completely forget about Wanda a.k.a. the Scarlet Witch. After Hawkeye's pep talk, she comes out blasting everything in sight, and earns herself a spot on the team. The swerve of Quicksilver sacrificing himself to save Hawkeye and the little boy was really well done. All movie long it kept looking like Hawkeye was the one that was going to die. James Spader was a great villain as the voice of Ultron. I would have toned down the comedy a little bit though. Some of his lines seemed out of place for an evil robot wanting to kill all mankind. I also liked that they started setting up the pieces for the next series of movies; Captain America:Civil War, Black Panther, Thor:Ragnarok, and Avengers:Infinity War.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

","Watching AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON can be summed up with the following words: entertaining, exhausting, and overstuffed. It's also one of the few summer action blockbusters that feels like it could have been better without all those incomprehensible, *forced* action scenes, in which the quiet character scenes between them are so much more memorable and interesting. With the numerous characters, even more so than the first, it's a miracle, then, that director Joss Whedon somehow manages to make the sequel coherent, balanced, and well paced.

","So..Let me start off by saying that,being a huge fan of Avengers and its first movie, I was nervous. Nervous because I wasn't sure about the Twins, whether I would like them or not, and because the first movie was so great that it was hard to picture a better one. Well..I was wrong!!so wrong. This movie is one of those you need to see more than once. The characters are,as usual,amazing, but they've evolved since Avengers and are much,much better. In Avengers it felt that some members of the team were more important than others, in this movie they're all equally awesome in their own ways. The action..THE ACTION, from beginning to end is non-stop, the movie begins and ends with action scenes,one better than the previous one. And lastly, the comic reliefs, I remember laughing plenty in Avengers but in this movie it's one joke after the other and they're all awesome! There were some people who complained about all the sneak peaks,saying that it showed too much, let me tell you,you will encounter a lot of things in the movie that you probably weren't expecting, in a good way. One piece of advice: What Whedon said is true, there is no after- credit scene(I stayed till the end just to be sure)but there is one AMAZING mid- credit scene.

","Avengers: Age of Ultron was a huge deal when it came out, because it was the next step for what the future of the MCU holds. After the fall of S. H. I. E. L. D. And classified documents are released to the world, the Avengers reunite once more to take down a Hydra base and retrieve Loki's scepter. When Tony Stark and Bruce Banner decide to use the scepters energy to launch the Ultron program that would become a peacemaker for the world that would put a end to anymore outside threats, it's discovered that Ultron has a mind of his own that's set on human extinction and it's up to the Avengers to put a end to Ultron's terror while battling demons of their own. What I love the most about this Avengers film, is that we get that actual Avengers vibe and moments throughout the film of them just being together bonding instead of them just battling against Ultron. Robert Downey Jr is fantastic as always as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Chris Hemsworth is magnificent as Thor. Chris Evans is great as Steve Rogers/Captain America. Mark Ruffalo brings his A game as Bruce Banner/Hulk in this film. Scarlett Johansson is stunning as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Jeremy Renner is brilliant as always as Clint Barton/Hawkeye. The newcomers Aaron-Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen as Pietro and Wanda Maximoff were my favorite of the new cast members of the whole film and helped make the film as great as it is. James Spader as Ultron himself I thought was a great casting choice to portray the character. My only problem I really have is not with him or his portrayal, but in all the promotions for this film made him out to be more menacing than he actually ended up being, but other than that, he was a good villain. The character I was most glad to see come to the MCU in this film is Paul Bettany's J. A. R. V. I. S./Vision. After being in the MCU as the voice J. A. R. V. I. S. since Iron Man (2008), it was really great to see him actually come to the big screen and into the MCU. Other cast member such as Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury, Anthony Mackie's Falcon, Don Cheadle's Rhodey/War Machine, and Cobie Smulders Maria Hill were also great additions to the film although I felt each character was definitely underused a bit. I loved the chemistry between Bruce Banner/Hulk and Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow throughout the film and I really wished we would of gotten more of them together. I was also glad to get to know a little more about Clint Barton/Hawkeye too. The sibling relationship between Pietro and Wanda Maximoff was great, but I felt they didn't show as much as they could of. Overall, Avengers: Age of Ultron is thrilling, fun, visually stunning, and action packed from beginning to end while also looking forward for what's to come to the MCU.

I do think it is a good movie though, I'm just not sure if it was my cup of tea.

I also like that this movie focuses more on exploring different characters and give them more depth, even though I don't find the new characters all that interesting. My big issue with this movie is that it feels a little too much like a compilation of setups and explanations, whic only exist to set up future movies. Some of this has to do with the somewhat boring plot, which only somewhat touches on new elements, the slightly messy pacing, and the new themes that felt a little undeveloped. The movie is fairly well directed, albeit not spectacularly so. The villain is alright, and I like how he is a portrayal of Starks darker side, though he was a little boring. The climax is also fine, even though it is another case of the world being destroyed if the heroes fail.

","Beginning with 2008's Iron Man, Marvel's franchise is a behemoth larger than any of its heroes or villains.

Maybe the novelty of seeing these demi-gods on the big-screen just hasn't soured for me yet, but I found Ultron's nerd-splosion to be (mostly) unendingly awesome. It may have an over-abundance of characters and too many battles, but it's also quick witted, thematically grounded, and immensely entertaining enough to satisfy any fan. This Comic-Con-come-to-life adventure kicks off with our guys fighting side-by-side, a truly cinematic moment of epic proportions that doesn't disappoint. They are brought together to fight Ultron, a botched creation of Stark's whose power and ruthlessness are equally endless. As the plot unfolds, it feels more like a well- constructed bridge to better (and darker) places than a destination unto itself, but the wonderful performances and dialogue guide the festivities delightfully. Deeper, though, is a recognizable political element to the proceedings; Cap and Tony stand-in for our own two-party government system, while showing presenting these disparate ideals as less black-and-white as we often think. Sure, Ultron is lesser in almost every way to the original, which was arguably the greatest superhero movie of all- time. People sick of superhero epics will most assuredly not be persuaded by Ultron. However, those of us who still find endless joy in likable characters, snappy humor, and strong themes in their action movies will be far disappointed.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

There are a lot of unnecessary scenes that could either be replaced or completely removed from the film to better develop the plot and the characters. Some of the characters are pressed more heavily than others as well, Tony is really the main character in the film, he creates the villain and shows his true side while changing his persona very slowly, but it doesn't feel that way, it just feels like he shows up and is stupid for the sake of the storyline. This means that there isn't really a MAIN character. Captain America does literally nothing besides fighting robots, hulk smashes, black widow does some flips and the other sides characters do nothing. The only person I feel had an improvement was hawkeye, his life outside the avengers is explored more thoroughly and it pays off, it is actually one of the more interesting sub-plots of the story. The plot is quite linear, straight-forward and simple which is nice, it means you can shut your brain off and just watch as superheroes crush the robots. The villain is actually pretty good... to begin. He is very intimidating as a battered old stark robot but soon turns into a pretty bland supervillain with lowsy dialogue and really unnecessary humour.

This will be a huge hit at the box office.I really like Robert Downey Jnr as Tony Stark. Chris Hemsworth is great as Thor. Scarlett Johanson is so sexy as always.

","AVENGERS : AGE OF ULTRON REVIEW- Just finished watching Avengers Age of Ultron.we know its marvel's money making series so we don't expect quality or class from these kind of films. We expect some eye catching action,stunts,vfx etc. and film fulfills all these needs. Here we gets a perfect sequel. We see more action,more destruction,much stronger villain in case of visuals . Story seems little bit similar to bollywood flick Ra.one but we know its Hollywood which never let us down. Awesome VFX,brilliant action sequences,eye catching 3D work and fairly good story makes this film a must watch. All actors have done a great job as they did in their previous films. Story is not that much great but screenplay is really better what we look for. Director made it pretty good to watch and makes sure we don't get bored. It keeps us to the edge of our seats. But the technical team has won the battle here they have done an excellent job here to make this sequel better than its 1st part. If you are looking for another action movie from marvel then you can't afford to miss this one. Probably this sequel is updated version of its prequel,and certainly much better as well. So go and watch it to experience some awesome visual effects. Kudos to the entire team for making a better sequel than our expectations.

There are more awesome and cooler action sequences, wonderful character moments with funny witty dialogues, spectacular visuals with more new Avenger characters filling in this time around.

The movie lives up to that tone; it's not as humorous as its predecessor, and that is definitely not a bad thing since we want this material to step up into a grittier and much challenging approach, but the real problem is its plotting. There's so much build up to juggle, starting from its own plot to the upcoming installments of this franchise.

It gives us more time to appreciate the original six Avengers all working together before Civil War broke them apart and Infinity war changed everything. We got to see Captain America and Iron Man's rivalry grow, Black Widow and Hulk grow closer, and Hawkeye gets a bit more depth in this movie. Thor, however, feels a bit left out of the relevancy loop in this one, but considering his pivotal role in the subsequent Avengers movies, we can understand that movies don't always have time for every character to get the spotlight. Plus, we got new additions in the form of Wanda Maximoff, Vision, Quicksilver. Additionally, Ultron appears. Now that we have seen Ultron's potential in the MCU canon animated series What If...?, Ultron feels somewhat weak by comparison. However, he does his job well in this movie of being a computer who sees the inverse correlation between ""peace in our time"" and humanity, and makes sure the stakes are high. Pun intended.

","It may not match the quality of the first film- but Avengers Age of Ultron packs enough dazzling action and entertaining superhero schlock for any fan to enjoy. I'll start with the flaws of the film, and really they tend to be quite repetitive. The beginning of this film is structured horribly. I get that they want the audience to find them in the middle of the action, but it's just so unbalanced to the rest of the film and forced just enough for it to be annoying. Joss Whedon's script itself isn't anything superb, a menacing villain yes, but his reason and logic go out the window about half way through the film completely- and it doesn't quite seem as realistic anymore. There are also just some lines of dialogue that seemed forced, and truly don't need to be there, although I appreciate Whedon trying to appeal to the audience (at least somewhat). That all being said, I enjoyed the h*** out of this film. It's incredibly entertaining to watch, and though we have had moments of disagreements between these characters before, it's so interesting to see their dark sides shed light on like this- and very largely that is due to Elizabeth Olsen's character Wanda Maximoff. Not only does she add a larger psychological element to the film, but she is also the only character we see truly grow over her time on screen, and I truly do love the way they entered her into the MCU- her being one of my favorite characters. The action scenes in the film are done incredibly well, and I enjoyed the cinematography very much.

","The second outing of Whedon's Avengers is bound to be compared to the first, but I cannot help but simply see this movie as a bridge between the first and the third that is yet to come. Don't get me wrong, I loved this movie, but as is inevitable with ongoing series the middle part is a lot of continuation and no resolve. The opening dives straight into the action without any prelude as to how the team have reassembled after the events of Iron Man 3, Cap 2 and Thor 2. The audience are left to assume that at some point between Iron Man 3 and this movie Tony Stark decided to rebuild the Avengers after Shield went down, thus donning his armour once more. With a few episodes of Angents of Shield still to air perhaps we will get a more thorough explanation but for now one can only conclude that Stark was the driving force of the idea and Cap the elected leader. The Maximoff twins are well executed away from the forbidden mutant element, the Avengers following Coulson's terminology of enhanced persons and dancing around the potential connection to the Inhumans that we may see in the future. Without giving too much away I'll briefly touch on the romantic entanglements portrayed, the main twist meaning that many a Barton/Romanov shipper are to be disappointed. I however found the development of Barton's character to be endearing and by the end of the movie was cheering on Hawkeye more than any other Avenger, now desperate for a solo outing for the character (TV series anyone?). As for Romanov, her romantic interest seems a bit forced and probably has more to do with the chemistry between the actors than the characters. There is a spark there no doubt but from a character standpoint it makes little sense and seems to just serve to pull at our heartstrings later on when the inevitable happens. It's a pleasure to see Paul Bettany on screen at long last, his JARVIS becoming a fully formed Vision and by films end becoming a New Avenger in his own right. The myriad of cameos are enjoyable and thankfully purposeful as the end of the movie sees the New Avengers forming out of this 'B-Team', hinting at the potential for Phase 4 of Marvel's plan as the current cast's contracts start to run out. In conclusion, this movie is a wonderful continued romp through the Marvel Cinematic Universe and leaves you desperate for the next instalment and doesn't drop the ball, which as the ninth movie in the series is an achievement in itself.

","With the cursory introduction period now behind us, the team is finally able to shift into what's made them so appealing to readers for so many years: their personal relationships, both on and off the battlefield. Of course, with more characters than ever it also runs the risk of overdoing it and crowding the screen, but that's not a problem at all: Joss Whedon manages to get everyone their moment in the sun in a simple, organic way. I was particularly impressed by the amount of time dedicated to Hawkeye and the Black Widow, not coincidentally the two members of the team without solo flicks of their own, and how effective they were at transforming the characters into essential human components of a squad so thoroughly populated by gods among men. Ultron is an intriguing foil, backed by a magnificent voice-over from James Spader, though his threat is often undermined by odd off-the-cuff remarks that, while amusing, make him seem more snarky than sinister. The screenplay is effortlessly cool and funny and rich, though, with staggeringly giant set pieces and no shortage of ballsy, CG-leaning action. A few plot threads could've used more exploration, particularly Thor's spirit quest in the second act, but with so many moving pieces I'm not sure how it could've been done in a reasonable amount of time. In short, The Age of Ultron is everything it advertised and more, an all-stops home run swing that made me giddy to be alive in an age where something so close to my heart could be translated so literally to living color on the big screen. My only reservation stepping out of the theater was that I'd have to wait years to catch the next.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

The worst part is that acts such comedic moron. Seriously his behavior is so childish. Ultron is a robot who should NOT make those stupid jokes. He should be severe, like what the trailers have put up.

And they're so much studio interference in this that I swear Joss Whedon being an idiot saying yes to all that nonsense. Its a novelty film. Yes, the actors did such a good job, and I love each of their performances, but they could go so far. With a script they have, I bet it was good, but they rewrote it to make it a comedy of this.

","The second Avengers film gathers all the pieces used in the MCU so far to launch another ambitious story. Whedon, who had done so well helming the first film, was allowed to take another crack at the mega franchise. Although the MCU had been strongly hinting at a Thanos/Infinity Gauntlet storyline for this sequel Whedon decided to frame it with Ultron as the primary antagonist voiced brilliantly by James Spader. The level of talent Marvel is able to assemble at this point is quite jaw dropping. Ultron's creation and this whole story is a departure from the comic books although it still hews to a few fundamental principles. 'Age of Ultron' also has the perhaps dubious distinction of being the 2nd most expensive film ever made. I think this film gets a bit of a bad rap, mainly because it exists in a bit of a limbo between the first Avengers film, which was so incredible good, and the Infinity Saga Avengers which were just as good if not better and this gets sort of lost in the shuffle as basically just a decent story that is a dalliance and provides mainly connective tissue for all these stories and characters.

The novelty of seeing all those iconic characters in one movie has been lost. 2: This is ultimately a setup for other Marvel movies. Now you could argue every Marvel movie is a setup for the next one, but it felt way more prominent here. It seems the whole reason the film exists is to set up for the Civil War arc.

It tries to convince you that the world is ending, but the problem is that it never really commits to it. That brings us to one of the key issues - the tone of the film that springboards from place to place. Whedon's dialogue is even more characteristically Whedon than ever before. One liners will chop up the action sequences and jarringly insert themselves into the scene as if we're never meant to take the whole thing too seriously. Maybe it would be bearable had it come mostly from the mouth of the egocentric and often sarcastic Tony Stark (then again, even he goes overboard, laughing in the aftermath of Ultron's reveal), but the whole cast seems to be attuned to this brand of humour. The worst moment is in the midst of the frantic and chaotic final battle scene, where Romanoff and Hawkeye discuss renovating the dining room as if they were sitting casually in a bar.

Happily, Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver and Vision (and even the Hulk-buster!) were each given their moments to show how awesome they are and they delivered. Ultron however, garners mixed feelings. His introduction in the after party scene was powerful, as he delivers a poignant speech on how insufficient the Avengers are. Sadly, it was all downhill from there as Ultron was effectively a witty punching bag, the heroes played around with. He was severely underpowered based on abilities he is perceived to possess! This evidently led to a head scratching, one sided final battle that is drenched with cheesy and corny taglines, and ""kick Ultron's ass and send him flying"" scenes. This shortcoming however, does not take away the film as a major turning point in the franchise as we witness internal friction due to difference in ideologies plus, the film finally introduces the concept of Infinity Stones, a perfect prelude for the films to come.

","After 2 viewings of this film I found it to overall be a good movie but as a fan of the MCU found it didn't quite hit the mark as did GOTG & CA:TWS. The film delivered on cast and action but what let me down was the overall story. Unfortunately Ultron is just a cliché AI who believes humanity must die. James Spader played him brilliantly as a mirror to Tony Stark but was not as calculative or as sinister i thought he might of been. One of the strongest moments for me throughout the film was the Hulk/Widow relationship that worked well with the characters inner struggles to define and accept themselves. This chapter was a stepping stone towards broadening the MCU in terms of BP, A:IW 1&2 and TR. The dynamics of the core Avenger team worked well along side the humour, which Joss nails but his focus should have been more on the conflict between Tony and Ultron. I'd of liked more of an Empire Strikes Back approach to the film which is what i expected, but instead the film was on equal par with Avengers Assemble.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

","I've been quite happily ploughing through Marvel's 'shared cinematic universe.' I've never read a single Marvel comic, so I can't claim to say how faithful each movie is to its source material, but I just enjoy them anyway for what they are – good, popcorn-munching, special effects-fests. The original Avengers film was, in my opinion, about as perfect as it could be – it was the coming together of all the individual superheroes and it did it really well, giving each of them appropriate screen time. Therefore, what I'm trying to say is that I couldn't wait for 'part II.' Now I've watched it, I just feel a bit hollow. I didn't hate it, but it didn't leave half as much of a mark on me as the original. Again, the Earth's finest superheroes come together to fend off a new evil that's threatening to destroy the planet. In the first outing, the villain was Thor's nasty brother, Loki, played brilliantly by Tom Hiddleston. Soon after part II was announced we were informed that James Spader would be voicing the new baddie – the titular 'Ultron.' Now, James Spader is a great actor and more than capable of nailing the role as a comic book villain. However, he's only there in voice. His metal, robot character is completely computer-generated and I just didn't find him threatening enough (in the same way I didn't find 'General Grievous in Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith).",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

218,7 May 2015,khanbaliq2,8," The haters are wrong. Avengers: Age Of Ultron is another fantastic Marvel film.
","When I was in a movie theater waiting for Avengers: Age Of Ultron to begin playing, I had low expectations for the film. I've read the reviews online, and many people were saying that Age Of Ultron is dumb, boring and overstuffed with mindless action. In other words, they were saying that this is Marvel's first turkey. So there I was sitting and expecting the worst. After what seemed like half an hour of commercials and trailers, the film began with thrilling action, with the Avengers on a mission. During the fighting new characters were introduced and their powers were demonstrated. This set up everything that followed. I definitely enjoyed the opening act. But wait, some reviewers mentioned that there's a dull middle section after the thrilling opening. So I kept on waiting for the film to get stuck in the mud. An hour passed and Age Of Ultron continued to entertain. In fact, even though the film is over 2 hours long, the time just flies by. After an hour passed I began to realize that the reviewers were wrong or that they were judging the film harshly. I'm pleased to say that Age Of Ultron is another success for Marvel Studios. Actually, I wasn't even thinking about this much because the film kept my attention until the very end. Sure, it's a Hollywood product, but it's a Hollywood product written and directed by Joss Whedon. So Whedon once again delivered what he should have delivered - a real superhero movie. People seem to forget that Age Of Ultron is a superhero movie. It's not The Godfather (1972). It's not Chinatown (1974). And it's not serious science-fiction like Solaris (1972). It's a film based on comic book material. And it delivers what it should - action, comedy, special-effects, fantastic characters and a world under threat. By the way, Whedon delivered all this with intelligence and style. The Avengers - Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye - are as good as ever. Their interactions are witty, fun and dramatic when needed. The new characters - Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch - are welcome additions. They're played well by Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen. But there's also Vision (Paul Bettany), whose role in the film is almost as important as that of the villain Ultron (James Spader). So I've got to say that this film really surprised me. It's even more entertaining than The Avengers (2012). It may not be better than the first Avengers film, but it's another solid entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. After the impressive Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) I was a bit disappointed by Guardians Of The Galaxy (2014). After watching Age Of Ultron I had the same feeling that I got after watching The Winter Soldier - that things can only go up from here. I definitely recommend Age Of Ultron, and I can't wait to see it again myself. The battle at the end was amazing too by the way.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

The director was there one or is that a robot job too seemed non existent the acting was appalling the dialogue banal but at least on the odd occasion unintentionally hilarious, the CGI remorseless repetitive and exhaustively moronic the music and sound crushing and on and on and on this pointless dramatic abyss went on and on in dull monotone without any dramatic high point or emotional engagement while the 3D was rubbish. Hollywood churns these monsters out like a Detroit assembly line of old is such numbers that the whole bundle of super hero franchises just seems like a blurr of same old same old.

Ultron is exceptionally played by James Spader, but for some reason I wish he was in the film just a little more. The Hulk and Black Widow romance was fine I guess, but I'm looking forward to Vision and Scarlet Witch. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were actually valuable to the film and I enjoyed them even though Quicksilver sadly dies. I loved the Civil War foreshadowing with Captain America and Tony Stark. Hawkeye was freaking amazing and can't wait to see him more because I love Jeremy Renner. Vision was brilliant and Paul Bettany was solid, I mean he picked up Thor's hammer(Cap almost does too, loved that comic reference). Andy Serkis was hilarious and awesome, can't wait for Black Panther. Ultron didn't have a big fight at the end with the Avengers, but he did his part and the film was still superb. Vision killing Ultron was so good because of the dialogue, ""You are incredibly naïve"", ""Well, I was born yesterday."" Excellent dialogue. Possible Planet Hulk set up, not sure.

Editing, CGI, and all other technical aspects of this production are as perfect as we come to expect them.

","This movie was fantastic. Great action sequences, great heroes, great villains, great jokes. All around this was a great sequel. Was it as good as the first Avengers film, yes and its probably even better. Each character is given more time to develop, especially Hawkeye and Bruce Banner/The Hulk who are characters who were not very utilised in the previous film. Also I would say Hawkeye was the character this film focused on the most and nicely tied it together. The new characters Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver were also great, and the accents were not at all distracting as others had said. The Vision, was probably the coolest addition to this film and he is introduced in a very cool way and its great that he is now a part of the MCU, Paul Bettany did a great job. Ultron, the villain of this film has been getting a lot of hate. But Ultron was great in this film. he was very human, he had so many different characteristics that made him a great character. Many viewers wanted him to be menacing and scary and that's all, but all that will accomplish is another dull MCU villain. Also the jokes in this film were completely fine. None of them pulled me out of the action, I was completely into the movie this whole time. Nothing made me look away and go, why did they do that? So really just go see this movie, ignore all the haters because this is a great addition to the MCU and you wont be disappointed.

This sequel therefore had a much bigger fan expectations to fulfill. Now that the novelty of having all these heroes together has already passed, it now depends on a great story to pull this second installment through.

That is not detrimental by any means, some of the best products of entertainment have followed the same formula and found incredible and justified success. What Whedon has done with both of the assembled outings though did not qualify in this category at all. I am aware that he has achieved that untouchable-nerdy godlike status that allows him the ""creative"" liberties to now assemble juggernaut films like Avengers Assemble and Age of Ultron, where the eye-candy mind-numbing loud-chaos inter-cut with snide comments, punchlines and one-liners aiming at posterity are force fed on audiences. Considering then that we're not expected to be watching a film with the narrative complexity that Nolan has granted Batman trilogy, we wouldn't have expected such thin, lazy and pedestrian treatment. The characters that previously were given little to no room to develop are now treated to clichéd and forced subplots, the setup and motivations are as tired and laughable as it goes and the required comedic relief is so forced and bland that it is widely cringing. Even so, Whedon somehow manages to go through the motions requiring an almost impossible sense of suspension of disbelief, even for comic book standards and plot holes you could walk an elephant through.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

The main thing the first Avengers had going for it was the spectacle of these characters teaming up on screen for the first time. It was a delight for longtime fans and for those following the movies to see such a wonderful payoff. This doesn't have that going for it. It's the same set of characters, with a few new additions I actually liked more than some of the previous characters. James Spader provides the voice for Ultron and does a magnificent job of being both menacing and funny. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and lovely Elizabeth Olsen are very good as Pietro and Wanda Maximoff (aka Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch), although their costumes are unimaginative.

I liked the movie not only for the obvious content but also for the many surprises and ""Easter eggs"" spread around for the comic book fans. I was very happy that the X-Mens Magnetos children, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver were in it. Marvel was not allowed to call them mutants in the movie by agreement with Fox studios. Their first appearance in the comic books were in the Uncanny X-Men #4 back in 1963.I felt this was a fantastic move in the right direction for the marvel universe. Fans even got to see the high rise building under construction that was used on the cover of the Fantastic Four # 26 when the FF teamed up with the Avengers to fight the Hulk. So, those seemingly small things put in by marvel put in throughout the movie is the reason some critics rated the movie average as opposed to those who rated it great; many people simply did not understand what was going on in the plot or in the background, hence causing confusion and in some cases even disappointment. Why does marvel do this? Because they are confident telling their stories in their own way. And marvel of course, set up the next Avengers movie by showing a villain a few minutes into the final credits.

287,1 April 2019,TheHonestCritic,2," This is the worst film in the official Marvel Cinematic Universe!
","After seeing the first ""Avengers"" movie in 2012, I was wondering how they were going to top it with the sequel. Then in 2013, the first teaser trailer came out for ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"". I thought, ""okay, 'Age of Ultron' is kind of a weak and stupid title, but I won't let it ruin the movie. Who is Ultron?"" I said to myself. I then looked up the character, and I was blown away. Ultron has several cool powers and abilities, and he is indestructible. ""Wow!"" I thought: ""how will the Avengers stop him?!"" Then, I watched the teaser, and the first two official trailers. They were laid out just as I thought, with an ominous tone, and a dramatic soundtrack. The first few trailers were great, it got me excited and hyped to the max for this film. Then came the final trailer, and at that point I slowly began to realize what we were in store for. The music wasn't very dramatic, and it just felt more like a day time television commercial. I thought: ""okay, this trailer is different. Where is the dramatic and ominous tone?"" But, I didn't care, I was still going to see this movie regardless. Boy did I make a mistake! This ""movie"" is stuffed past the brim with one-liners, comedic moments, it hardly followed the original comic book stories, and at no point did I feel any tension whatsoever. I've seen many disappointing films, and this ""movie"" certainly belongs in my ""Top 10 Most Disappointing Movies"" list. I knew before I first saw the film that they changed the original story. In this ""movie"", Hank Pym doesn't create Ultron, Stark does instead. That does not follow the original story. Now of course, some movies can get away with altering the story, but that does not work in this ""movie"". However, Tony Stark does create Vision, that is comic book accurate. That's the only thing they got right in this ""movie"". But as far as Ultron goes, I could not believe how they portrayed Ultron in this ""film"". Ultron is a wuss in this ""movie"", he is practically the polar opposite of his real comic book self. He's supposed to be a cold, calculating, mindless robot. So, why does he have facial features? That moving mouth especially perplexes me, it makes him look more like an alien in a suit of armor. WHY DOES HIS MOUTH MOVE?! Sorry for repeating that question, it's just so retarded. His real character in the comics just has a red light on his face that glows when he speaks. That would've been so much better, because we, as an audience would not be able to tell what he's feeling. In that case, you wouldn't know when he was about to strike! That would have actually brought forth some level of tension for the ""film"". Another thing, when Ultron says: ""I can't physically throw up in my mouth."" (HE MUST BE THINKING ABOUT THE MOVIE ITSELF). That ""joke"" would've actually made sense if he had the glowing red light when he talks instead of that retarded moving mouth. The light would have further clarified that he does not have a mouth, and therefore he cannot throw up. That would have made the joke work, and it would have been funny! Although to be honest, just thinking about this ""movie"" makes me want to throw up. Also, Ultron has next to none of his actual comic book powers, and I was looking forward to see how those awesome powers would be utilized in this ""movie"". But no, we just get a watered down tin foil looking ""thing"". Granted, James Spader is a good choice for the voice of Ultron. What a wasted opportunity! Another thing, the plethora of one-liners in this ""film"" are abysmal, there are so many that it almost doesn't feel real. You know, you'd think after ""Batman & Robin"" (1997) contaminated the Earth with its existence, film studio producers and writers would have learned their lesson! Now, the first ""Avengers"" movie had one-liners too, but there were not nearly as many. It had the right balance between action, comedy, and drama. Unlike the sequel, the one-liners in the first Avengers film are actually funny, but in ""Age of Ultron"" they're not! Also, the acting is all over the place in this ""movie"", some good, some okay, and some bad. The soundtrack is generic, nothing special or original at all. The sets and locations are boring. Sadly, the only good thing in this ""movie"" are the special effects, and that's not saying much. Special effects are usually a given in movies since the mid 19th century. I think that the biggest reason this is my least favorite Marvel Cinematic Universe film is because the movie had so much hype and build-up for over a year, and then it amounted to nothing. Out of all 20 plus movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this one, by far, emotes the most anger out of me. I give it 1 out of 5 stars, which of course equates to 2 out of 10 stars on the IMDB scale. On a final note, in the ""movie"" I wanted to hear one of the main characters say: ""Avengers, assemble!"" Sure it's corny, I know. But, I think it should be warranted in one of these movies. Captain America almost says at the end, but then the end credits cut him off. I was furious! Also, for a title called ""Age"" of Ultron, we didn't even find out how old Ultron was. Yes, that's a joke, I thought that I'd end my scathing review of this ""film"" on a positive, humorous note. The ""age"" of events in this movie take place in just a few days. Whereas an ""age"" can range from a year or longer, so the title doesn't make any sense! Nothing in this ""movie"" makes sense. Stay away from this ""movie"", watch the first ""Avengers"", or ""Avengers: Infinity War"" instead!",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

289,30 April 2015,Orange_Cinamatic,9," Redefining the word Avenging
","If, and, where The Avengers failed to captivate audiences, The Avengers Age of Ultron succeed, and in may ways excelled. There are numerous ways that this movie could be reviewed. Compared to the first one, or as an individual movie itself. Generally second movies have always fallen prey to the sequel syndrome, where the hopes and expectations of the film are let down; this is not that sequel. The movie itself is so gripping of excitement that one does not need to provide any spoilers to divulge just how breathtaking it will leave you, or more so excited. Each and every scene offers something new. Where the first movie was more about how the Avengers come to be, this movie shows the mentality and development of each character and why they are who they are respectively. The one thing that genuinely makes this film stand apart is the technology. Again, without spoiling, there are so many parts that make this a world that can be, but has yet to happen. Alien technology aside, which is a hard thing when talking about the Avengers, the human tech has been beefed up in a very realistic and futuristic way. Each and every fight scene gets better and better throughout the movie, and the characters themselves make the movie. So many laughs, so many twist, many where the action was less than a second beforehand, and you are still asking how and why, but there is no time to think. That is not an issue though, it all gets explained. The cause for a 9 rating instead of a perfect 10 is that there are some gaps. Questions of how he or she got there so fast, almost making it look like they teleported, but that was not the case. Overall, Avengers Age of Ultron is thus far the best action movie of 2015, and with respects to Marvel, the best franchise movie yet. What the future holds for Marvel has yet to be revealed, but there are clues. When the next movie is released, the battle to save the earth, to save mankind, will need more heroes than the ones that have already captivated the theatrical world.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015
290,28 April 2015,KineticSeoul,8," More of a hit than a miss!
","This is one of those movies that actually met my expectations. It's probably the best action movie of 2015 so far. And when I say action for this movie, there is LOTS and LOTS of action. I can't say it's the best superheroes movie so far, but it takes the cake when it comes to the most action sequences so far. Joss Whedon really wanted to deliver to the comic book fans the super action piled upon action superheroes experience. Plus this probably has the biggest budget for a superheroes movie so far, so for the most part it delivers. Although the action sort of feels tiresome after a while, since like I said it's action after action. Without it giving a breather, except that very slow moving middle section. Tony Stark/Iron Man is once again the main main character this time around once again. Not in the level of Wolverine to the X-Men but most of the story revolves around him. Even if there is a reason for that, it goes in a direction where he is the key player. While Captain America seemed to not have that many good parts as the leader and the master tactitician of the team. Instead Joss Whedon takes some pokes at him a bit. I don't like to come up with assumptions, but I guess that has to do with the fact that Cap is a Christian and Tony is an atheist. Plus Tony has that enticing and flashy image going for him, which is a super plus when it comes to the media. And no I am not a fan of Captain America, although I want him to win in the Civil War movie against Iron Man. I think Joss Whedon did the best he could to give each team members a bit of screen time and few moments to shine. There is a lot of grandscale action sequences but like I said it gets tiresome after a while, most of the audience in the theater seemed numb after a while. When it comes to fights though, I personally thought Hulk vs. Hulkbuster was the highlight. It really wasn't a necessary fight and the plot could have moved along without it. But I can't complain because it was just badass. The action sequences does seem to have some editing problems when the action gets too chaotic. The plot was hit and miss with it mostly being a hit. Going in a slightly more complex direction may seem like a good idea, but it doesn't really work this time around because at it's core it's still a very simple story. The plot is basically by the numbers and didn't seem to flow very naturally, but that is only a very small gripe. There was this one part where the Korean audiences geeked out. The thing about Korean audiences is that they are usually very respectful and mostly very quite during an event, such as watching a movie. But they geeked out in one or two parts. Personally I like to go to a packed theater, where you can be in the moment and enjoy the reactions from other audiences. And I don't mean being rude, like constantly having a conversation or texting away (which is something you will not see amongst Korean audiences in theaters in Korea). But being able to enjoy the moment and show what appeals to our senses is one of the benefits of going to a theater in my opinion. Overall this will be one of the biggest and grandscale blockbuster popcorn flick for year 2015. So yeah, take some friends and family, have a blast. I will say that some of the cast is getting a bit old to play these parts in my opinion. With Captain America and Thor in the safe zone for now, but they are also the most vulnerable when it comes to playing these roles, because their physicality and image means everything for those characters. Not hating or anything, it's just the natural order of things. No one can stay on top forever.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

","There are many things to love about Avengers: Age of Ultron, particularly the separate origin stories of Wanda and Vision, although their romance doesn't spark yet. But this is also Clint Barton's (Hawkeye's) best MCU film where we enter his home and family life outside of S. H. I. E. L. D. and the Avengers; even Tony Stark had no idea of Clint's secret life. Hawkeye features into one of the best dramatic moments and bits of dialogue in any MCU film: the pep talk that he gives to Wanda under fire as Sokovia rises, basically anointing her as an Avenger, if she is up to the task. She then emerges as Scarlet Witch. Hawkeye also has an ongoing playful spite with her twin, Pietro (Quicksilver), from the very beginning of the film when Pietro toyed with him in the Hydra battle and in a few other scenes. This relationship culminates in another beautifully dramatic scene. Just as the audience was prepared to see Hawkeye die in a rain of canon fire from the Quinjet piloted by Ultron, never to return to his family life, he is saved at the last second by Pietro who sacrifices himself. We then see that Hawkeye named his newborn son after him. Thor's hammer was in the spotlight and featured like never before, a running gag as a test of worthiness that Captain America almost passes and Ultron passes with flying colors. Finally but not least of all is the underrated voice acting performance of the great James Spader; devious, arrogant, and at times humorous, his Ultron steals every scene he's in. Even with all these threads, the screenplay does an outstanding job of weaving it all together into a great action film with a cohesive plot that does a good job to advance the story toward Infinity War.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

Oddly though this doesn't feel like a comic book of the screen, much more a video game with tons and tons of CG based action interrupted only by character interactions that feel more like cut scenes than actual parts of an actual movie. Much of what happens takes place in many different locations throughout the world, but there's so little sense of the vast distances between them that they may as well be in the very next room (or studio). Though with that said the good cast do attempt to bring something out, but there's so little substance that it's a losing battle (both Thor and captain America in particular do very little indeed besides fight robots).

","Avengers Assemble was a brilliant coming together of all Marvel comic book fans' favourite superheroes in the same film, so it was no wonder that there would be a follow up, directed by returning Avengers director and Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon. Basically, continuing from the events of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, the Avengers: Iron Man aka Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the Hulk aka Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), Captain America aka Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Black Widow aka Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye aka Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) fight against the forces of Hydra following the exposure of S.H.I.E.L.D. They capture Baron Wolfgang von Strucker (King Kong's Thomas Kretschmann), who had been experimenting on humans using the sceptre previously wielded by Loki, they encounter two of the experimented humans, twins Pietro Maximoff aka Quicksilver (Kick-Ass's Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who has superhuman speed, and Wanda Maximoff aka Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen, Mary-Kate and Ashley's sister), who can manipulate minds and project energy, but they retrieve the sceptre. Within the sceptre's gem, Stark and Banner discover is an artificial intelligence, and in secret use it to complete Stark's global defence program called ""Ultron"", but Ultron (James Spader) becomes a sentient being and believes that the world will be saved by eradicating humanity. So Ultron begins his plan by eliminating Stark's A.I., Jarvis (Paul Bettany), attacking the Avengers at their headquarters, stealing the sceptre, upgrading his rudimentary body at Strucker's Sokovia base, and building an army of robot drones, he then kills Strucker and recruits the Maximoff twins, they hold Stark responsible for killing their parents with his weaponry, and obtain vibranium from arms dealer Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis), they Avengers pursue them, but Wanda stalls the heroes with haunting visions, until stopped by Stark's anti-Hulk armour. Following some destruction and the threat of Wanda's mind manipulation, the Avengers go into hiding at Barton's safe house, Thor goes to consult with Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) on the meaning of the apocalyptic future he saw in his hallucination, and meanwhile Romanoff and Banner are finding mutual attraction for each other, but Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) shows up and encourages the Avengers to form a plan to stop Ultron. The team's friend Dr. Helen Cho (Claudia Kim) is forced by Ultron into using her synthetic tissue technology, the vibranium and the sceptre's gem to perfect a new body for him, uploading himself into his new body Wanda is able to read his mind and discovers his plan for human extinction, she and Petro turn on him, Captain America, Black Widow and Hawkeye find Ultron and retrieve the synthetic body, but Romanoff is kidnapped. The Avengers are fighting amongst themselves, but Jarvis is found still alive, having been hidden by Ultron in the internet, Stark uploads him into the synthetic body, to become physical being ""Vision"" (Bettany), Thor returns and explains that the gem is one of the six Infinity Stones, the most powerful objects in existence, settling their differences the Avengers, along with Vision and the Maximoffs group together to stop Ultron. To cause global extinction Ultron has used the remaining vibranium to build a machine to lift a large part of the capital city skyward, he intends to crash it into the ground, Banner rescues Romanoff and becomes the Hulk to fight, the other heroes fight against the may machines, while Fury, Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders), James Rhodes aka War Machine (Don Cheadle) and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in the Helicarrier evacuate civilians. Pietro is killed, Wanda is enraged and abandons her post to destroy Ultron's body, allowing one of the drones to activate the machine, the city plummets, but the machine is overloaded by Stark and Thor and the landmass is shattered, in the aftermath the Hulk departs, unwilling to be with Romanoff and endanger her, while the Vision confronts and eliminates Ultron's last remaining body. In the end the Avengers have established a new base, run by Fury, Hill, Chpo and Selvig, Thor returns to Asgard to learn more about the manipulation of recent events from forces he suspects are coming, Stark and Barton depart, Rogers and Romanoff prepare to train and welcome new Avengers: Rhodes, Vision, Sam Wilson aka Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Wanda. In the mid-credits scene, Thanos (Josh Brolin), seen in Guardians of the Galaxy, is dissatisfied by the failure of those who have tried to conquer the world, he vows to retrieve the Infinity Stones himself. Also starring Idris Elba as Heimdall, Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, Linda Cardellini as Laura Barton, Julie Delpy as Madame B and Stan Lee cameos as a military veteran who attends the Avengers' bar victory party. The cast still all do very well, Downey Jr. quipping, Evans being the sensible fighter, Ruffalo as the man who turns big and green, Hemsworth as the long-haired warrior, Johansson being the confident female, and Jackson being the guiding head figure. The only tiny problems I have with this sequel is that the story is not as compelling as the previous Avengers film, and the villain being artificial intelligence is not completely menacing, despite a chilling voice by Spader, but you can slip into it enough, and there are no complaints to had about the spectacular set pieces and special effects to create to create all the superhero gadgets and gimmicks and explosive sequences, it is a worthwhile action fantasy adventure.

The danger is Avenger-made this time as it's Stark (and Banner) who created this mess that endangers all civilization now. Their intentions may have been noble, but shame that Ultron is not really capable of making a difference between good and evil and between cause of and reaction to violence. So he quickly becomes the Avengers' biggest nightmare. I personally was a bit surprised that Fury did not really teach the two culprits a lesson for what they secretly did.

The robots in this movie looked like the robots in Terminator and in a sense they took on the same character. Avengers 2015 seemed to encompass all aspects of science fiction movies and then connect them into a whole story. The themes of evolution, change and chaos and order are universal themes and they coincide nicely with the way the Western World is operating in the realm of Europe, the Americas and Asia/Africa. There is a feel of colonialism which is deeply rooted in the notion of innocent versus guilty. This movie was a snapshot of tensions that each Western adult human being lives with in order to live in the civilized world ... a world where, on some days being a super hero is necessary just to get through the day in one piece.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

","I am an unabashed fan of THE AVENGERS. I understand it has its flaws, particularly in the pacing, but I paid my money for a geek spectacle and that's exactly what was delivered. I count it as one of the best comic book movies, up there with THE DARK KNIGHT. Now that we've gotten a sequel, I expected more. I held AGE OF ULTRON to a higher standard. We've already had the big action bonanza but watching Iron Man, Captain America, and the rest of the crew together on the big screen has been done and it's not enough to carry my interest this time around. The promotional materials made it out to be the darker, edgier sequel with repercussions to the heroes' actions and, though it might be clichéd, an EMPIRE STRIKES BACK vibe. Well, it came close but fell short. I still enjoyed AGE OF ULTRON but I walked out of the theater with a resigned shrug, muttering ""It was all right.""

346,10 September 2015,brchthethird,8," A solid second outing for everyone's favorite superhero team
","When crafting a sequel to any movie, the goal is usually to make it bigger while still retaining the qualities that made people fall in love with the first one. On that alone, AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON succeeds marvelously. While the action in THE AVENGERS was mostly confined to New York (at least the climax), ULTRON is more of a globe-hopping adventure. The banter between the team members is as funny as ever and, without the need to bring the team together this time, there was more time allotted to character development, particularly Hawkeye and Black Widow, who haven't had so much to do in the Marvel movies up to this point. Of course, with this expansion comes a handful of new characters to add to all the ones we're familiar with (and most of whom at least make a cameo). Chief among these is Ultron, a sneering villain whose personality is directly based on Stark's. There are also the twins, Pietro and Wanda Maximoff, who have a particular connection with Stark that sees them initially aligned with Ultron against the Avengers. To sum up all that's good with the film is quite easy: it's frickin' cool. A slightly more polished way to put this is that it delivers on the all of the witty repartee and CGI-enhanced action that we've come to expect from the MCU. However, there are a few points where it doesn't quite live up to its predecessor. First, the novelty of having the team together has worn off a bit. Second, while the increase in locations is appreciated, the narrative is somewhat more splintered and unwieldy than it possibly should have been. A lot of this has to do with some scenes which are setting up future adventures. Another big part of this has to do with the final action set-piece basically being a redux of the Battle of New York from the first AVENGERS. And, while Ultron is great as the villain always ready with a quip, his motivation remained as opaque and vague as Scarlet Witch's powers (summed up as ""weird""). It boils down to not being as streamlined nor as unique as what came before it. Still, none of this really negatively impacted my enjoyment.

","Review: I'm really in two minds about this films because I liked epic action scenes and banter between the characters but none of them have really moved on from the first movie. I did prefer the action in the first Avengers and the introduction of the Hulk was brilliant but he was hardly in this movie. Anyway, the movies is about the Avengers taking on the evil Ultron who says that he wants to save the world but he really wants to destroy it. I think that's about it really! There's loads of technical jargon throughout the movie, which really went over my head but there are some other great elements like the introduction of 3 new characters, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch and Vision. The attention to detail was spot on and I was on the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie but I still preferred the first film, mainly because of the shock factor. The fight between the Hulk and Ironman was one of the greatest scenes in the film and I enjoyed the scene when everyone was trying to pick up Thors mallet but I think my expectations were a bit too high. Anyway, it's definitely one to watch but I won't rate it as highly as the first movie! Enjoyable!",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015
350,13 October 2015,guisreis,5," Hollywood, stop! It is not a good idea to make superhero or action movies with astounding visual effects but a poor screenplay
","The first part of the movie (12 minutes) is a quite good action flick. Then, the title ""Avengers"" appears and the film gets worse and worse. Indeed, the visual effects throughout the movie are amazingly well done, extremely realistic and numerous (three thousand of them!), and many people, particularly youngsters, think that this is the most important thing in a superhero film (then rejecting many nice movies which lack those amazing visual effects or that fast pace or that amount of explicit violence), but I strongly disagree: the story is always the most important element... and this one is poor! In my opinion, most of the time ""Avengers 2"" is a bit boring, there are many silly dialogs, lots of unfunny gags, and the black-green romance is cheesy, besides having no previous development (the chat about having or not a future together is specially pathetic). Talking about the good traits, Robert Downey Jr. was the best again. The scene in the train with Captain America and the twins was also nice, and so are some fights. Though, the film overall sucks. Is is a shame that Hollywood action movies are spending more and more in technology at expense of good screenplays. The films from the second phase of Marvel cinematic universe (this one, ""Thor: the dark world"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" are awful, and I also include here ""Avengers 1"") are much worse (so poor stories! so focused only in visual effects!) than the ones made up to ""Captain America: The first Avenger"" (this one and ""Iron Man"" are particularly good).",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

","Watching ""Serenity"" director Joss Whedon's ""The Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is like riding on a runaway roller-coaster. As he did with the initial ""Avengers"" extravaganza, Whedon orchestrates several larger-than-life, gravity-defying, high-octane action scenes that grow exponentially bigger and bigger. Not content to dawdle, Whedon opens this PG-13 film with an exciting assault on a Hydra stronghold in Eastern Europe. Ultimately, he never allows this outlandish, CGI-laden, 141 minute blockbuster with its non-stop shenanigans to wax anticlimactic. Occasionally, ""Avengers 2,"" as I shall refer to it from here on, pauses only to let the heroes and villains deliver important expository information that lets us know about their impending strategy. Whedon relies frequently on rapid, ginsu-knife style editing to depict simultaneous close-quarters combat in different spots among the various super-heroes as they spar with their adversaries and recover from body blows no ordinary mortal could survive. One of my favorites occurs when Thor slams his hammer named Mjölnir against Captain America's shield and sends it hurtling like a giant Frisbee to topple more than a few baddies. Comparatively, not only for its number of narrative surprises but also for its revelations about certain characters, ""Avengers 2"" surpasses its 2012 predecessor. Whedon discloses far more about Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow than previous Marvel movies, and we find out about Hawkeye's private family life. As it turns out, Hawkeye enjoys home renovation and brings the subject up in the middle of an explosive firefight. During this helter-skelter cliffhanger, Whedon brings in three fresh characters: the obnoxious A.I. robot villain Ultron along with the brother and sister duo Pietro and Wanda Maximoff. Actually, if you saw 20th Century Fox's epic ""X-Men: Days of Future Past,"" you've seen the same character with a slightly different moniker. In the ""X-Men"" opus, Pietro was called Peter, and he shared the same ability to move so fast that most of what you saw was a blur. Another new character crops up in this ambitious sequel, but I'll leave you to learn about him on your own. Die-hard Marvel fans should enjoy this big, boisterous, slam-bang saga as much if not more than the original. Of course, anybody who read the original comic book will howl at the departures. Many of the Marvel characters are owned by different film studios, so fidelity to the source material in this cinematic adaptation was impossible without copyright infringement.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

362,6 May 2015,fabiolpinheiro1993,7," A lazy compilation of half baked ideas put together, but still... lots of fun!
","1- The beginning - i get that they wanted to start the film with a big action sequence and i actually liked very much of the going through each character in battle, but like every action scene in this film i didn't like the camera shots, and while its fine action it looked too much like a video game, and the film should have started with each character being assembled again, following each character follow up to their individual films that had huge things happening, and that is completely ignored here, mainly iron mans 3 ending. 2- Ultron - Well tony's obsession with creating him goes pretty much against everything that happened in iron man 3 and he's so out of character. He had nightmares and panic attacks for creating demons as he said: it all starts with good intentions and then everything falls apart, and he destroyed every single creation of him so i really don't see why would he want to create such a problematic AI. Then he is created like in 2 minutes and suddenly he's bad, and has tony's Witt all of which i still don't know why since nothing his explained. For an AI he's very dumb and he makes no sense, his plan to achieve world peace is completely against all logic, he wants to wipe out every life form on earth so the humans can evolve?! It makes no sense. I don't like the fact that his lips moved when talking, hes a robot! its weird. 3- Hawkeye is a farmer?! Out of nowhere we learn that hes a farmer, and has a wife, 2 kids with 3 soon to be. This could be resolved with a wonderful writing but the way it was executed seems forced. 4- Hulk and Black widow! This was by far the worst thing in the film. She was completely out of character, and their love thing and plans for running away comes out so forced and so out of nowhere that i still don't know what the hell whedon was thinking. She was perfect in captain America 2 and had a wonderful relation with captain America something that gets ignored here much like in the 1st film with iron man. She gets reduced to a chick in a Rom com. 5- The vision - he was so awesome. But he was created in 2 minutes again, with no explanation or something. 6- Thor's side trip - what the hell was this? Well i still don't know since Thor disappeared for a very long time in the middle of the film, this was very weird, and weirder was his return. 7- The siblings - they are two very cool bad ass characters that have powers which make them easy to have very cool things to do. But no! They are completely wasted and useless, and appear like 10 minutes in the film and come out of nowhere like much in this film. Seeing what singer made with quicksilver with just a scene or two in days of future past, establishing him and getting me instantly hooked, here it's very disappointing. He just could do so much and then dies and i'm supposed to cry, he appeared like 5 minutes, so this comes out very flat. Also their development is ridiculous. They have some sort of vendetta against iron man so they join ultron only to find out hes bad! in 2 seconds and joining the avengers, and suddenly they forget about the vendetta with not even a talk with iron man and no one even asks when they appear in the avengers HQ since only captain knew they were good at that point. Also their idea of tearing apart the avengers with mind manipulation goes nowhere and it's so useless. 8 - Iron man vs the hulk - pretty cool but man of steel much? 9- The ending - Well if you've seen the 1st film this one is just the same thing, like the entire film! The avengers assemble, they argue against each other, they fight each other, they assemble again and then they beat an army in a city, This time its robots in a flying city, its a very cool visual, but is poorly executed and Then Ultron gets beaten the exact same way as Loki was, way too easily. Can we get some villain that actually fights as an equal instead of a cgi army that its only there so the avengers destroy them in every way possible?! And this not only is like iron man 2, iron man 3 but of course the avengers. 3 same endings! Thanos! Finally hes doing something! But he seemed so goofy that instead of fear i smiled. 10- Technical aspects - well the film looks cheesy, which is unforgivable for a 250 million plus film. The visual effects are murky and foggy or something, for most of the time i don't get whats happening with the cgi, the cinematography its terrible, and the score its like soup opera quality.

I liked the character they created for Ultron, but he never really did anything interesting or memorable. Some aspects of the movie that should have been more clear were things that you had to put together for yourself, which shouldn't be a bad thing, but in this kind of movie, it is. Ultron's motivation, for example, is the main aspect driving the plot, and you really have to work it out of the subtext. For a superhero movie aimed at a wide audience, I don't think that was effective. Loki's true purpose only gets a passing mention in the first Avengers, but it was also backed up by the first Thor movie.

","Avengers Age of Ultron is a really great film. Watching this movie, I enjoyed how everything worked together to bring the audience such an interesting and action-packed film. The special effects were spectacular especially during certain scenes like when the Avengers are fighting the two twins, the battle against Ultron, and of course when the heroes use their awe-inspiring abilities. Humor and overshadowing also had a large importance as well.
The character plot of Wanda and Quicksilver is also very interesting. The growth of these two characters over the course of the movie really shows how much thought and effort the directors put into making the film seem real. Wanda and Quicksilver start out as two of the main antagonists against the Avengers but through a course of events, the two become the heroes at the end of the movie actually working with the Avengers to battle Ultron and his monstrous duplicates of himself. In the beginning of the movie, Wanda is responsible for defeating all of the Avengers at once by using mind control and manipulation which are some of her many acquired powers from being experimented on by Hydra. Eventually she and Quicksilver decide to change their motives and actually become powerful allies that help the Avengers. In the end of the movie Wanda becomes an Avenger after the death of her brother who sacrifices himself to save Hawkeye. Quicksilver goes from being the guy to severely injure Hawkeye to actually sacrificing his own life to save him. Another thing that I enjoyed in this movie was the special effects. The entire movie was filled with special effects.
Everything looked so real and it was easy to get lost in such a franchise of a move. Humor also had a big role in making this film as great as it is. For example, when Thor taunted everyone with his magical hammer. There were a lot of jokes and lightness added to the film which otherwise would have been too serious to be watched by younger audiences. Forecasting had a huge importance in this movie as it predicted the events of the last movies of Infinity War and End Game. I found it particularly interesting that Captain America decided not to pick up Mjolnir even when most thought it was evident that he was incapable of doing so. As this shows that he may indeed wield this powerful weapon in the future. He did in fact wield the hammer in End Game and this shows that this movie was foretelling that it might be possible for this event to occur in the early stages of the Avengers movies.
One point I found quite humorous was when Vision, who was just created, lifts the hammer that no one can pick up except Thor. He says there may be no way to get the Avengers to trust him but, then easily picks up the hammer that only worthy people are given the privilege to use. Even the other Avengers except Thor and Captain America are not worthy to wield this special weapon, but he can with ease. This shows how worthy he truly he is despite his comment. Another aspect of the movie found particularly entertaining is when Ultron has unintentionally revealed his evil intentions and even the twins who are still bad at this point, are against him as well. In the end, all of these factors for me really made the movie worth watching.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

","The sixteenth entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Avengers: Age of Ultron is a disjointed mess of a film. The casting, as per usual, is perfect. However, quite a lot here doesn't make sense of is just simply confusing. The romance between Hulk and Black Widow is sweet, however when Hulk tries to convince her there is no future with him because he is a monster, Black Widow states she is also a monster bc she was sterilized years ago during her Black Widow training, which is quite honestly insulting to women who are unable to have biological children. Thor has a scene where he goes into a spring to get back to his vision he had earlier in the mission, however not only is the nature of the spring never explained, the vision hardly comes into play afterward. The visual effects are good, but not as breathtaking as previous films, and Ultron's design is pretty bland. The mystery of the infinity stones is heavily teased though, though the post credits scene makes no sense as to how Thanos is aware of Ultron.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

","""Peace in our time, imagine that."" After finally taking control of Loki's staff, Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) begins to run tests on it in hopes of being able to harness it's energy for his personal use. The good news is is that his idea worked. The bad news is is that he accidentally created Ultron (Spader) who wants to save the world by destroying it. Now, with the help of the rest of the Avengers they most stop Ultron from creating total destruction, but in-fighting within the group starts to derail the mission. Once again I will start by saying that I am not a huge fan of this whole Marvel Universe series. One reason is that I was never a huge comic book fan, the other (and main reason) is that because of all the planned movies we have been told about there is no suspense watching these. Other series like X-Men and (depending on how you view it) Batman have killed off major characters. Once one of the major characters dies it gives you a sense of, holy crap what's going to happen now. I'm not saying the movie would be better if Iron Man gets hit with something and dies. I am saying that knowing that in the next few years there will be another Captain America movie (Iron man will be in this one), a new Thor, 2 more Avengers as well as many many more featuring smaller characters in this movie takes away any suspense the movie tries for. The characters in this movie start to fight with each other, but knowing that next year they will all work together again makes that scene seem pointless. These movies are all review proof so nothing I say will change you mind about watching it or not, but I think the total saturation of this genre is starting to get to me and I am fast losing interest in these movies. I will be in the minority of this one but to me this was boring and without any type of suspense I was wondering how much longer can these story lines keep me interested?

401,1 May 2015,InMyHonestOpinion,7," One day the machines will rise and we won't know what hit us.
","Avengers Age of Ultron opens with the Avengers team; Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, Black Widow and Hawkeye all fighting their enemy Hydra in a country known as Sokovia. Hydra have been using a Loki's staff from Thor's home world Asgard to help aid in creating the ultimate weapon. The Avengers smash Hydra's plan and take back the staff. (This is all before the actual credits). Back in Stark's lab Tony and Bruce discover a curiosity within the staff. Tony has ideas of how it can be used and goes about reprogramming the mechanics. The plan backfires, suddenly The Avengers find themselves in a race to save not only themselves but the entire planet from being completely obliterated. ​ Written and Directed by Joss Whedon after the success of the first film I think I wasn't the only person expecting big things from the man, it seems as though he has attempted to please everyone possible with this film, there is so many ""Easter Eggs"" throughout it's very hard not to feel overwhelmed by it all. One thing he has done very well though this time around is the screen time given to each Avenger, I can recall in the first film Hawkeye especially wasn't given much time at all and almost seemed an extra, Joss has definitely made up, including back story and an even bigger surprise when it comes to Hawkeye and who he is when not firing arrows from an endless quiver, as with Thor who has suddenly become a bit of a comedian making him appear a lot less Godlike which I personally think is a great thing. And Hulk has been totally humanised by being given a romance as well as become very emotional and not just as Bruce Banner. I loved what Joss created with the characters this time around and feel it is all definitely beneficial to the franchise and everything that will come after and has come before. My absolute favourite thing though was the introduction of a very special character from the Marvel Universe, when that moment happened on screen my heart suddenly got a lot faster and my body tingled with total and utter joy. Unfortunately though what was done with that character was woeful and so pointless, I would have personally preferred they saved the unveiling for another film or franchise completely and made it all worthwhile and exciting rather than letting the unveiling be so unfulfilling and wasted. ​ Once again the CGI like in a lot of film recently let me down, especially the opening battle scenes, the entire thing was a CGI mess,it looked fake and unrealistic, the way the characters moved turned my entire expectation on its head very early as I was absolutely disgusted with how fake it all looked, however once the opening credits rolled through the CGI suddenly picked up again and things became a little less messy. My other little gripe would be how much was stuffed into the film, new character should be exciting and rewarding but within this film they felt flat and unengaging. Joss put so much energy into creating his heroes by humanising them but left his villains and other new characters quite lifeless, I just didn't care for them at all, sure there was the sad story of childhood but that was it, it needed more, perhaps a flash back or something, as for Ultron, again I found him completely worthless and so unnecessary his plot to destroy the world was childish it needed a lot more depth to it, we as viewers need to understand why, especially when it comes to ""the villains"" why are they the way they are and why do they want to do the evil they conceive,what makes them turn from being you and I to a super-villain? Just being told isn't enough I want more, more story, more depth, more plot to make it at least somewhat engaging and enthralling. ​ So does the Avengers Age of Ultron meet up to the same standard of its predecessor I honestly can't say yet, believe it or not it's been a week since I saw the film and it is still playing on my mind, I find myself in conversations about the film constantly just trying to find where it sits for me. There is a lot of clever lines and hidden gems it is definitely worth seeing; although I saw it in 2D I have been told that in 3D the CGI isn't as apparent so nowhere near as nasty. It should be noted; Being a PG film it's absolutely for the entire family I just think some scenes that are a little slower where Joss humanises everyone may get a little dull for those younger in age. I have left a lot out of this review to not give away spoilers but there is so much more to see I would absolutely recommend seeing this on the big screen rather than waiting for DVD release. Besides not seeing in the cinema means you'll miss out on the biggest Egg of all during the final credits, and that's not one you want to miss!!!",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

Marvel has created this incredibly epic world that they just keep building and building and building and while I stand by the fact that eventually they are going to collapse and over-saturate the market, so far they are doing it right. The super-hero films they have created range from good to truly great and the first Avengers film was truly great. It was a non-stop thrill ride and the definition of a great summer Blockbuster. Since then we have the second phase of films (Thor 2, Captain America 2 etc) that served to build even more complexity to this intense world they have created. Sometimes I have to wonder if they are getting too smart for their own good. Avengers: Age of Ultron doesn't even cap any of the story. It actually is yet another middle ground in this Universe but it certainly serves to bring together Earth's mightiest heroes and further their story. The first Avengers film was amazing because it was the first step we saw all these amazing heroes on one screen together and director Joss Whedon did an incredible job of balancing everyone. Age of Ultron still balances everyone pretty well but gives far more attention and depth to characters that have been secondary up until now.

There's also this cohesive balance between the film's story and its action. It's very much about action and entertainment, but there are also new characters to introduce, a blossoming love story between two Avengers to showcase, the infinity gems to gather quietly in the background, and a new villain to develop. While Whedon's wit and sharp writing are clearly very much an integral part of the film the humor doesn't seem quite as on the mark as it was in the first film.

He embodies an evil AI robot perfectly. He can be really calm and yet menacing and sometimes he can be full of rage and anger and manipulates others and using silver blade and using Scarlett witch,s they unleash mind games with our superhero's minds Dept to there inner fears and their stories and great action scenes pursue with another iron man suit the hulk buster which when the hulk goes ape the ensues a epic fight of the burley kind and with robots and villains way better than the first film looking for world end and with ultron looking to use the scepter power to a machine out of earth cities to rise up (no pun intended) there is battles of wit here more than the first and dark stories to be told 3d effects are epic so great Aeriel battles so it and the power source to be protected so when all heroes come together it a great finale with nick fury helping out all here and the vision here a sequel that leaves you breathless If the finale lacks the emotional payoff of the first movie, that's also because Whedon had set himself up with a near impossible task in the first place. That probably explains why the 'Age of Ultron' is at its core a very different movie from the first 'Avengers', not just because of how our superheroes evolve in the face of imminent destruction precipitated by one of their own but also because of the complex psychological themes that Whedon explores here. His ambition is certainly admirable, but it is inevitable that those looking for the same straightforward thrills as its predecessor will be at least slightly disappointed. That said, this is still an outstanding feat by any measure, a riveting blend of intimate character moments and grand action spectacle that remains quite simply, Marvel-Lois. and cameos a plenty to explain my 9.5/10 for this film this film hasn't got the epic battle of new York in this film but this has an epic story of 10 characters and the inner fears so this gives my story 10 out of ten action is 9/ because there is smaller battles going on so not on the epic scale we have seen but still amazing so 9/10 and 3d is 10 so at 9out of ten I think I got this score rite bring on phase 3",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

Phil Coulson should have been reintroduced aboard the helicarrier, which would have freed future writers to include him in the movies and would have reinvigorated fans of Agents of SHIELD. They also could have brought in Quake to destroy Sokovia in the air, but I'll grant that might have been a little too deus ex machina. At the very least, I would have loved to see the entire Agents of SHIELD cast cameo in their quinjet. It wouldn't detract from the film. People who haven't seen the show would just take them as random anonymous SHIELD agents. It would be an easy Easter egg to pull off. Quicksilver absolutely shouldn't have been killed off. We never had enough time to know and love him, meaning his death was without emotional impact. And furthermore, it was done late in the show and the scene didn't even capitalize on it. At the very least they should have made it more climactic. Why was Rhodey randomly back to his War Machine suit after Iron Man 3 made a big deal about rebranding him as Iron Patriot? Why was the Iron Legion suddenly back at full strength after Tony made such a big deal about destroying it? Minor continuity errors aside, it was a good movie.

Much like the first Avengers, it is as close to a perfect movie as you can get regardless of the genre. In fact, I consider this effort superior to that first film and I didn't think that was even possible. As has been noted before, Superman had generally held the title as most fondly remembered or nostalgic superhero film flaws and all. Spider-Man had generally held the title as most beloved superhero film because of the character and the time it hit. (Yet, those two awful reboot movies are definitely something the character needs to shake off at this point) TDK had held the title as the most rabidly defended superhero movie from its fan base. Iron Man had generally held the title as best all-around origin film. Captain America The Winter Soldier added its own unique flavor and vaulted to the head of most people's ""best sequel"" list.

His task this time: Show the Avengers, Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner/the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to be working together as a team; drive a wedge between them through Stark's creation of a peacekeeping AI called Ultron (voiced by James Spader) that turns against them; develop a romance between Natasha and Banner; flesh out Hawkeye, the regular Joe and, to this point, the most under-developed member of the group; introduce new characters, such as the twins Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen).

It's still well rounded, but I left the theater feeling that it wasn't Whedon's best work and that he either kept too many reserves or ran out of them all together. The sub-plots are usually way better embedded in the main story and even if it's an action flick his emotional scenes carry a bit of a bunch. He still tried to do it, but in this area the movie falls short and some of the scenes even feel unnecessary.

Marvel's production line is intent on servicing a dedicated fanbase that has, till now, shown little fatigue of derivative movie formulas involving action and comedy. But the loyalty to the superhero template also raises questions about Marvel's inflexibility: they're one of the most powerful and financially successful studios in Hollywood but how much personal imprint can a director achieve when instructed to follow a blueprint rather than testing cinema's boundaries? A modern pop comparison to Marvel's success but equally their creative limits is within the gaming industry. The video game publisher Activision produces yearly editions of the Call of Duty franchise, which are financially successful products but criticised for their lack of innovation.

","The first Avengers film was more of an cinematic accomplishment of bringing together different heroes who had their backstories and characters set up in their own movies, and pitting them against the threat of an alien attack led by the notorious, ever-entertaining Norse God of Mischief, Loki. However, it still had its moments. Hulk throwing Loki around, that epic moment when he says that he's 'always angry', Iron Man's unforgettable response to Captain America's 'just a man in a suit' remark, among many others. One of the complaints I have about this movie is that it lacks some of that. Sure, there are epic and funny moments throughout the film, it's just that they aren't as impactful, and are lesser in amount. I was also hoping to see Andy Serkis in mo-cap for this movie, but his Ulysses Klaw was a pretty wasted effort. Less screen time, and no impact whatsoever. Sure, he'll have a bigger role in the Black Panther movie, but it just seemed dumb to have him in this film.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

","""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is a meh and an unremarkable movie. Just when I thought Marvel was starting to Mature with ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" & ""The Winter Soldier"" ,they go right back to making a generic soulless superhero movie you have seen a 100 times before. I am still waiting for them to pull a ""The Dark Knight"" and make a movie that is unpredictable and completely flips the script. They crammed & rushed so much in this movie. Ultron is Evil right away. They don't even touch on why Tony is back as Iron Man despite retiring in ""Iron Man 3"", making the end of that movie redundant. They try to give Hawkeye some depth which just feels like 4 movies too late. There's a forced romance between Black Widow & the Hulk which comes out of nowhere. Despite Black Widow being a female Christian Grey all this time with her mysterious and secretive personality. Now all of sudden she's jonesing and wanting to take a shower with The Hulk. Also Jesus Christ there's so much repetitive Power Rangers/ Transformers level action. Say what you will about ""Fast & Furious 7"". But at least all the action scenes were memorable, intense and entertaining. The action scenes aren't engaging because there's no tension. We all know no one is going to Die because there's so many bloody sequels coming out over the next 5 years. The action scenes quickly become White Noise. Hell even ""Cinderella"" a Disney family movie was more visually stunning and engaging. The only pro's is the Banter between The Avengers, some funny one liner's, Scarjo's cute nose and Elizabeth Olsen finally getting some recognition. The movie just feels like it was made in a factory. No heart just a business transaction. Skip this ""Cultural genocide"" and wait for the Blu Ray.

","The superhero movie has become a cultural juggernaut blown way out of proportion. Since ""Iron Man"" debuted in 2008, our days, months, and years have thrived off of an anticipatory thirst for the latest action-packed face-off. In the space of seven years, we've been consumed by eleven different ""Avengers"" blockbusters, some introductions, some sequels, some forgettable, all fun. For such silly movies, they have been blessed to have been directed by some of Hollywood's most brilliant minds (Joss Whedon, Kenneth Branagh, Shane Black, Jon Favreau), in the process piecing together an array of junk foods that inexplicably taste healthy. It's a wonder that a feeling of repetition is not the first thing on everyone's mind – how many times can clever supers defeat a seemingly unbeatable foe? – but then again, it's a wonder that the majority of superhero movies, ones of the last decade, that is, have been so, so, so ... pardon my generality, good. Blast ""Iron Man 2"" for its flatness, insult ""Thor: The Dark World"" for its monotonous action (I did neither, by the way); fact is, there has not been a straight-up dud in this apparently never ending franchise.

","""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is the 11th film entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, that began with ""Iron Man"" in 2008. Joss Whedon who wrote and directed the first team up movie of the MCU - ""The Avengers"" in 2012, returned to do the same for the sequel, and as confirmed by all, barring a changing of minds, or a surprise return down the line. will be his swan song for Marvel. ""The Avengers"" is generally considered one of the best, if not the Best Superhero film of all time. The first trailer for the sequel suggested a much darker tone, while the trailers that followed showed the trademark Whedon humor he injected into the first one – indicative of his past work, ala his TV series - ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", ""Angel"", etc., would be there as well. While there is some dark tone to it, with some great moments when it goes in that direction, ultimately most of great parts of the movie for me were the great humorous one-liners, spread out practically amongst all the main players, and one or two non main players. Returning Avengers are Tony Stark – Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America - Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) , The Hulk – Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow – Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansen) and Hawkeye – Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner). A number of their supporting players from other MCU movie figure prominently as well, and they are also joined by new comers – The Maximoff Twins – Pietor – Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor- Johnson), and Wanda – Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), as wel1 as the Vision (Paul Bettany). The antagonist is the Robot ""Ultron"" (voiced by James Spader - Yes – The voice of Tony Stark's computer Jarvis – When you the see movie – all will be clear). In as nut shell – the movie is a mostly fun and entertaining for the around 2 ½ hour running time. It is well paced, so it never feels long. All the characters are given moments, and different story arcs are touched upon with each of them. Sometimes that does create a jumble, and if some were fleshed out more, while it would have sacrificed time for some of the other story arcs, I think it would have improved the movie. Having said that – In the end, while not as good as the original, it is an enjoyable, fun ride, and Whedon's great Dialogue, humorous and non-humorous, when it does hit, and it hits often - shines! 3 ¼ out of 4 Stars - 8 ½ out of 10 Stars.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

These movies aren't Oscar winners, they are MARVEL this is exactly what marvel has been giving us and its been doing it so well for so long I think we are judging it more heavily. The main reason people are so hard on this movie is because the first movie was so well done it set a high bar. If you want character development watch the characters in their individual movies. This is the movie that brings them together not focuses on their individual life, and even so I feel we got some great growth on the part of hawkeye and black widow. By the end of this movie I had fallen in love with the twins and hated watching quicksilver die. Vision was a wonderful addition and brings a lot to the team.

","They do need to figure out how to settle on a genre with these movies, because I'm not sure what they were going for. At times it felt like I was watching a cartoon, and other times a sci-fi movie. I will say that James Spader's performance as Ultron was chilling. I got chills down my spine every time he spoke. The advantage of Disney owning Marvel is they can have villians sing otherwise happy Disney songs and ruin people's childhoods by making them creepy. Now, concerning the characters of Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. (Scarlet Witch is my MCU crush!) Neither of their actor(esses) sounds genuinely Russian, and at times you can tell the accent is fake, because half the sentence will be in an American accent and the other half a ""Russian"" accent. I did enjoy the witty banter between all the members of the Avengers, and surprisingly, even Ultron had some witty dialogue. He is probably the best villain in any of the MCU films. Now, one more thing. I didn't put the ""One does not simply leave a Marvel movie before the end of the credits"" meme like I usually do, because there's only one scene after the first 2 minutes of credits, but nothing at the end, so don't wait for the very end of the credits.

","Avengers: Age of Ultron is the 11th entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Let me get this out of the way first: The first Avengers movie in my opinion was much better than this one. Once again, Joss Whedon directs and does an excellent job. Also the cast is unbeatable with Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers/Captain America, Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk, Scarlett Johansen as Black Widow, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury. Newcomers are Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Quicksilver and Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch as well as James Spader as Ultron. The cast does a great job.

And finally, Black Widow says ""Nothing lasts forever"". And then Captain says ""except for TROUBLE TROUBLE"". 2. Cool characters like the twins. But weird that they kept on saying ""enhanced"" instead of ""mutant"". The bad. 1. WHY?! did Black Widow like Hulk? Since when?! I thought she and Hawkeye were a thing! And suddenly Hawkeye is out of the picture with a family? And I can't believe Black Widow would be so vulnerable about her feelings, or care that she can't have children. She's tough, it's such a 180. 2. No Loki. The villain Ultron was lame and not a threat. He's just a machine. 3. Less funny from Iron Man, who seems like a douche.

The villain had a potential to be something big, like really, really big, but ends up feeling like nothing special. And the plot relies heavily on just stopping this ""big bad"" from destroying the world with a crazy plan, and lacking of real consequences to the characters, which some of them are just in the movie because they were in its predecessor and it would feel weird not having them return.

Spoiler: Thus, when a certain character dies on the film, even though he/she was great, you end up feeling kind of glad instead of being depressed. You're glad that at least the percentage of a super-hero being a ""unique"" thing has increased a little again. But then there is a glimpse where a great number of super-heroes flood into the Avengers building, and one feels that all the big/famous super-heroes will retire after the new ones take charge. Yet another thing I didn't like about the movie was its inclination towards ""Love"", it is a science-flick and shouldn't revolve around love between two lovers! Lastly, Avengers is a series of movies that kids love to see as well, thus the women in the movie should have covered their breasts better, pregnant woman and a lot of kisses shouldn't be in a kid- movie either!

","To give credit where it's due, Whedon again does a great job making believable the interactions of a very disparate group of characters. Just the idea that a thawed-out WW2-Uber-patriot, a Norse god, and strangely likable arrogant-genius who wears a metallic-supersuit could occupy the same film universe seems ridiculous on paper (Let's hope Snyder can do as well with Amazons and Mermen in Justice League.) The actors do a good job inhabiting their characters, and Whedon succeeds in creating character arcs with the amount of time available. The long arc that takes the Scarlet Witch from an ally of Ultron to a foe feels natural. Secondary characters typically fail to connect with audiences, but her scene with Hawkeye and her brother's sacrifice makes her contribution to Ultron's downfall more than filler.

Unfortunately, ""age of ultron"" doesn't live up to it's predecessor. The action and humor is still there. Joss Whedon excels at crafting these fluid elaborate action scenes where the camera pans between multiple characters kicking ass in their own way and then occasional teaming up to take down some bad guys. It's pretty impressive to see considering the size of the Avengers roster and the extreme differences in each superhero's powers.

There is a darker tone to this film then the previous entry, but in some ways not dark enough.It is hard to explain but something just seems very disjointed this time around our main heroes never seem emotionally engaged or in any kind of real danger like I feel they should be, maybe this is down to Ultron being a Cgi character as opposed to Loki being human in the original, maybe the actors found it hard too interact with an army of Cgi robots all the time. After the great Winter Solider last year I had high hopes for the Avengers age of Ultron. I am glad that the Russo brothers will be taking over from Joss Whedon after this film, he made a great first Avengers film but should of had the foresight to create something different this time rather then make a sequel like so many other sequels that just fall flat, he has admitted having a nightmare while making this movie and I think it shows. However it will still be a financial success because of the brand. New characters Quicksilver and Scarlett Witch are welcome additions, but still fail to add any emotional depth to the film. Scarlett Witch is given better material to work with then Quicksilver. I am sure the future will still be bright for the Avengers, especially after Civil War next year.

","This movie essentially begins with the Avengers raiding a Hydra stronghold in Eastern Europe and in the process seizing a staff previously belonging to Thor's brother Loki. Naturally, ""Thor"" (Chris Hemsworth) wants to take the scepter back to Asgard but he acquiesces for a few days to allow his Avenger teammate ""Tony Stark/Iron Man"" (Robert Downey Jr.) a couple of days to examine it a little further. Unfortunately, Tony Stark has no idea of what he has stumbled upon and accidentally unleashes a computerized being named ""Ultron"" (James Spader) who decides to help humanity evolve--by destroying it completely. To gain time and keep the Avengers occupied he creates an army of robots all controlled by his computer intelligence. Meanwhile, he subsequently acquires the metal used to make the shield for ""Captain America"" (Chris Evans) and forces a scientist named ""Dr. Helen Cho"" (Claudia Kim) to use her knowledge in synthetic tissue to create a new body for himself. Throw in the addition of several other superheroes and villains and the result is complete mayhem on earth. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, from what I understand, this film made over $1.4 billion and ranks as one of the highest grossing films ever made. And with a profit margin like that additional sequels are already in the making. Be that as it may, however, I was not overly-impressed with this movie by any means. Although the CGI was top-notch I thought there were too many characters involved in too much action and too many sub-plots going to really amount to anything coherent. That being said, the fact that this film garnered so much money is certainly an achievement and nothing succeeds like success. But it was all a bit too much for me and I have rated it accordingly.

Needless to say the Avengers don't respond well and band together to battle an army of robots. Joss Whedon returns as director after his grand success with the first film, and the special effects are explosive. Robert Downey Jr returns with more sarcasm within the suit of Iron Man. He feels responsible for Ultron, which leads to hostile debates within the group. Chris Hemsworth as Thor brandishes the famed hammer while trying to interpret a nightmare that was cast upon them all. Chris Evans as the shield throwing Captain America finds the mass of Ultron even a challenge for his own weapon. Mark Ruffalo as Hulk is guilt ridden after his mind is hacked resulting in an outburst that has him clashing with Iron Man. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow identifies with Hulk and her sense of isolation. Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye shoots the arrows while concealing a family of his own. James Spader provides the menacing sarcasm of Ultron whose views are corrupt.

Both may've been originally (or still) sneered at by many--perhaps, even for good reason, including repetitious and superficial fan servicing--but they've been extraordinarily popular. Last year, during the 200th anniversary of Mary Shelley's novel ""Frankenstein,"" I reviewed a bunch of related films in relation to that book, as well as seeing how such shockers became a Hollywood staple.

","Once again, Earth faces an existential threat and all that stands between us and extinction are 'Earth's Mightiest Heroes'. This time we hapless humans are faced with 'Ultron', the verbose metal-manifestation of Tony Stark's software solution to world-peace gone rogue. Lacking the spark and cleverness of the first Avengers film, this sequel covers much the same ground, as the team squabbles amongst themselves, then come together when they are needed most. The usual superhuman crew (introduced in solo films or the first entry in the franchise) are opposed/joined by a couple of Eastern European meta-humans (complete with Boris and Natasha accents), 'Red Witch' and her brother 'Quicksilver'. Elizabeth Olsen looks great as the telekinetic Red Witch but her abilities are so vaguely powerful that it's hard to imagine why she alone can't solve most of the problems. Also new on the scene is 'Vision' (also vaguely all-powerful), in whom is embedded one of the MacGuffins around which next film in the franchise circles ('the excellent ""Infinity Wars"", 2018). 'Age of Ultron' is a step down from the first Avengers film: the story is illogical (see goofs section) yet predictable, the script weaker (especially the endless (and sometimes incongruous) ""lighthearted"" banter between the übermensch), and the villain more irritating than menacing. The special effects are pretty good (although the film opens with a gamey-looking battle between the team and Hydra minions), as is the acting (considering the genre). While I got a little tired of Tony Stark's incessant 'droll egotist' shtick, it does play well against Steve Roger's 'greatest generation' decency and Thor's demigod literalness, and Mark Ruffalo is excellent as Bruce Banner/The Hulk, the ultimate in ego/id incompatibility. The pacing of the film is a bit off, especially the prolonged layover in Hawkeye's Norman Rockwellesque farmhouse (and why you would use your family's home as a 'safe house' when at war with a near-omniscient foe is beyond me). All in all: OK as a segue in the 'Infinity Stones' story arc but a bit weak as a standalone feature.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

Visually the film is spectacular, there are many actions and those scenes are great shot. Some will say that there are too many characters, that there is too much action (seriously?), There's not enough story. Nonsense. The film lasts two and a half hours, which is quite enough. They even had to shorten because the first version was a long three hours and some tidbits. While expecting a darker approach in sequel, it can not happen.

This brings me to the next problem, you just can't say where actually the Avengers finished their job. It seems that the director did not sleep enough when he was finishing the last 10 minutes of the movie. Last then minutes were more devoted to the sequel of this sequel. Some people here say that Avengers 2 is better than Avengers 1, but I don't find any reason behind that. There were dialogs in Avengers one that inspired us and made us love the team. Rather in this movie, Nick Fury's role was diluted. There was creativity in the fighting scenes of the first movie, but fighting scenes of this movie were mostly boring, except for one scene. Avengers 2 had burden of our great expectations but it was not even near to the first one. You will not find amazing dialogs like ""I'm always angry"", ""I didn't argue with the god that did"", ""puny god"". If you are coming to see Hulk play an interesting role, stay home.

And it's glorious, a wonder to behold but it's missing one thing. The Film sees earth's mightiest heroes assemble again as Tony Stark creates a peace-keeping program known as Ultron that eventually turns on him believing that the only way to save mankind is to destroy it. Now the assembled team must stop the out of control robot in order to save mankind. We also see the return of some of other favorite side characters such as Maria Hill, Falcon, War Machine, Heimdall, Eric Selvig and some new characters like Quicksilver and Scarlett witch. James Spader he was born to play Ultron, he owns this role. The relationship between Bruce Banner and Black Widow is by far a great edition that hope continues for the next time we see these two characters on screen together. Giving them traits in common, explores Black Widow's past and giving them a romance that is incredibly believable. Hawkeye has a much larger part of this film and that is my favorite thing about this movie because he is my favorite Avenger and I hope I see him in Infinity Wars. Everyone has talked to death about the casts chemistry from the first film and that same chemistry is still here, there's no need for me talk about it. I love the new characters of Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver and I'm glad they got these two actors to portray them, they would have been my first choices. The only down side to this movie is that their were a lot of things cut from this movie but it still manages to be one of the best superhero films I have ever seen. It will never beat Spider-Man 2 though. Also the Iron Man situation with him quitting by the end of the third film was quite possibly one of the many things cut from the film but, like in the first film that be rectified in dialogue with him creating the peace keeping program so he doesn't have to be Iron Man. All in all people keep saying Guardians of The Galaxy is the best film from this universe which while I do think its great I don't think it's better then all of the others except Iron Man 3 and 2.

628,7 April 2020,jaovitu,9," Great critiques, one weak spot
","The second movie of the Avengers presents action with a lot of social/political critique. New heroes are shown and some open spots are left. All of this to create a well-constructed cinematography based on the great acting, special effects, direction and screenplay writing.
Different from the major of Marvel's movies, Avengers: Age of Ultron are constantly forcing the viewer to think about social/political questions centered on technology and union of people. This is a great advanced made by the production, because it compensates the all-action in the first Avengers and starts a new era for Marvel.
You will realize a lot of open spots on the plot, they are not screenplay's failure, they are proposital leaks to new advances in the Marvel's universe that will be resumed in posterior movies.
The only weak point on the work is the new hero. He is used as a key-point to the development and conclusion of the story, but he hasn't a great construction as character and break the rhythm of the plot, besides his adding to the reflections about society and humanity during the movie. Therefore, if he was substituted to explore more one of the heroes and the new piece of Marvel's universe, the movie will be 10/10.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

The acting didn't see sincere, as if everybody was just phoning it in. The jokes seemed flat. The action scenes were confusing, exhausting and ultimately boring. The villain was weak. Too many subplots. The romantic plot seemed to come from nowhere. In short, the very things that worked so well in the first film worked so poorly in this film.

","So after a very successful first film in what is a very popular franchise Avengers: Age of Ultron brings the team back together for another world-saving event. This time, instead of Tom Hiddleston's power-hungry Loki, it's the menacing A.I. robot played brilliantly by James Spader. And that's what is a really great addition to the film; Spader is such a good bad guy, his voice didn't go through any filters, he did motion-capture for the face so you get all his mannerisms and in an 8-foot robot, that is very effective. The other two new cast members I enjoyed more than I expected too, they did a great job as the enhanced twins and their powers were very enjoyable to watch on screen.

Also there's a limit to Whedon style witty banter and I think the limit was reached here.

","First of all, the first Avengers is great. It is a well written, clever, and well acted movie. It's action scenes are great, it features a god villain, and above all else, it puts many major superheroes into one movie. That was the draw. Seeing all your favorite heroes on screen is what matters. That effect couldn't be replicated. Age of Ultron is not a bad movie by any means, but it also doesn't add anything new. The CGI fight scenes are still good, the heroes still work well together, the comedy is (somewhat) spot on, and the villain is still well written. Ultron simply relies too much on the wow factor that brought its predecessor so much success. The comedy is also up fro debate. It seems unnatural in this movie, almost forced. The characters are sarcastic and witty, but this movie was filled with comedic moments, almost too much so. The jokes fall very flat when the audience is being beaten over the head with them. The finale is also, well, not exciting. If an editor placed the finale of the first Avengers films and this one side by side, there is very little difference. The over the top CGI cluster that is the finale just doesn't seem as exciting after seeing an almost copy paste from the original. Avenger Age of Ultron is a good movie, its a fun movie, but it doesn't bring anything new to the table. Had the film actually brought something new, like a darker plot, or a more interesting plot, or... anything really, the movie would have been great. Unless Marvel stops dumbing down their films, they are going to hit a wall. They need to learn that their most successful films are the ones that are different (ie Guardians of the Galaxy and Captain America: Winter Soldier).

But honestly, for a fantasy movie, the visual effects in the beginning of the movie were terrible. Specially in the first fight scene, when hulk was touching hands with black widow, but the effects got a lot better during the movie. In the last fight scene where the avengers are all together united and fighting, the visual effects were pretty decent. The story also grew too fast. I will now talk about what I consider to be the strenghts of the movie: The slow motion scenes during the fights, and the humor. I saw myself laughing when Iron Man was beating Hulk's face and saying ""Sleep sleep sleep"", and also laughed when Quicksilver fires a gun to make people get out of the building. Another strenght is the ""story"" of rivalry created between Hawkeye and Quicksilver, with a little twist in the end of the movie that was a nice touch for the end of the movie. Overall, I can't give this movie an 8, because in my opinion doesn't exceed my expectations, and also is worse than the first one, like I said before.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

","Yes this was a phase 2 movie, but believe me, this is the beginning of a new ""Age"" of the greatest Marvel movies ever to come. First off, that opening scene is a great way to bring the audience back into this vulnerable world that the MCU lives in. Next up we get to see the new characters, and a familiar staff. At the beginning Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch are on the wrong side, working against earths mightiest heroes, but eventually they realize that there side leads to total human annihilation and decide, ""Hey maybe we should save the world with these people."" And when they do, there is nothing in this world that I would rather have seen then the rest of this masterpiece of a movie. Ultron himself may have been the greatest super villain in an super hero film to this date, well probably not Dark Knight Joker level, but yea, pretty damn close. His intention from the beginning is to destroy all things in his way, including the human race. But he never calls it genocide, he calls it, evolution. This brings a certain level of insanity to the plate, which only adds to his menacing appearance, evil robo army, and his sexy robot voice. Yeah, sexy. The story is great, always moving, always intense, with some love on the side, and some jokes every now and then, our heroes find themselves in a weird situation throughout the entirety of this film. But with all the good of our heroes, we have to talk about the 3 new ones. First off, the twins stole my heart. Quicksilver and Scarlet wish had a legitimate intention, but were kids manipulated by an evil AI, set off to doom the world, and when they realize this, they know they have to grow up, and help the Avengers instead of hurting them. The Vision was spectacular. Paul Bettany really outdone himself on this one, and I really enjoyed the fact that this film is basically Ultron V.S Jarvis: The Battle of the AI's. So yeah, this movie is good, don't listen to all the negatives, because even though there are some, the positives are way more important, and in my mind, they don't exist. Yeah I am a biased nerd, but I am pretty sure there is no one on this planet, who can legitimately say they did NOT like this movie, because those people do not exist.

Now the problem is it is nothing beyond a good old formulaic superhero movie. It began with a bang, and it is not a understatement when I say it is one of the most electrifying starts to a movie I have ever seen. The story after that however is not so great. The film is basically about ultron trying to destroy the world and our heroes trying to stop them...nothing more. Numerous characters appear from the marvel universe...new characters quicksilver played by Aaron Taylor Johnson and scarlet witch played by Elizabeth Olsen are introduced. Vision comes to life in the film....there is so much happening in the movie, that the movie might feel a bit rushed at times. Don't expect character development in case of Thor, iron man and captain, but hawk eye, scarlet and quicksilver are given quite some screen time this time....also there is romance between banner and romanoff. In the performances there is little to choose from but Jeremy runner as hawk eye is a surprise package, James spader does well as ultron he did sound menacing. The movie is technically topnotch...it has a lot of action and it is a good thing because they look great. Now coming to the movie's biggest problem, humour. I did not like iron man 3 for the same reason and here too, there is excessive humour, which robs the film of some much needed intensity. The climactic fight was so great in avengers, because it had that dramatic tension. But here however even there, everyone is cracking jokes...why rob a scene of its dramatic merit. The film would have been so much more impactive without humour in some otherwise intense scenes. It is true, it is a superhero movie, should be fun but still some of the jokes in the movie are very ill placed. Overall, avengers AOU is a very entertaining watch but it is just another superhero movie with a bigger budget and better action sequences. The pity is it could have been so much more without its comical tone..the movie ends with thanos announcing his arrival.

","Avengers Age of Ultron has too many characters, too many enemies, too many twists, and too many sub plots. A lot of the times, I felt that it was too rushed and too difficult to follow the direction of the movie. I felt the introduction of Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olson) and Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) was unnecessary, as they weren't important to the plot most of the time. It also doesn't help that they both sport very annoying and unconvincing Eastern European accents. I felt Ultron (James Spader) played his role very well, but was a weak villain overall. I felt that the AI gone rogue plot to destroy the world was way too cliché. There were some good moments in the movie, and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) get a chance to shine where they previously didn't in Avengers 1. There are a lot of funny moments, and the best parts of the movie are where they interact and bounce off each other, and trade puns. In the end, this movie just feels frantic and hysterical and half- baked Marvel movie, lacking the quality of Captain America 2 and the fun factor of Guardians of the Galaxy, making the movie fall short of my expectations.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

","Avengers Age of Ultron is one of the weaker entries in the MCU. Its pacing is all over the show, there's a lack of any serious character development, the questionable CGI gives action scenes an unrealistic look and the dialouge is pretty average or cheesy. It serves the purpose of introducing us to new key characters of the franchise such as Wanda (Scarlet Witch), Ultron and Vision plus some other less important, but no less integral, individuals such as Pietro (Quicksilver), Ulysses Klaw and F. R. I. D. A. Y. Outside of that though, it's an easily forgettable chapter of the MCU. It doesn't have the relaxed fun of the first Avengers film nor the scope and intensity of the 3rd and 4th. It's not devoid of fun though, the scenes involving the Avengers trying to lift Thor's hammer and War Machine sharing his action stories to varying responses are quite light-hearted and humourous. The story takes some questionable turns though and none of them I really enjoyed, the ending is particularly silly with the whole flying city thing... The action scenes are mostly pretty good but they do feel like they are trying too hard to make them exciting and different, there's so much happening at once it makes it hard to keep up and I sort of gave up trying to... I don't like how they nerfed The Hulk and Pietro isn't that exciting for a super powered character (he was handled much better in the X-Men universe!) but all-in-all the fights were fast, loud and colourful.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

","Much of what made Joss Whedon's original ""Avengers"" such a joy in 2012 was his ability to juggle and make it look effortless. As writer and director, he combined spectacular set pieces and small, clever moments deftly, and found a way to give every member of his large, star- studded cast an opportunity to shine. It was a summer blockbuster with a sly sense of humor — the most dazzling high-wire act — and one that would be tough to top. Whedon follows up that smash hit with the latest installment in the behemoth Marvel Cinematic Universe, ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" and this time, the effort is obvious. There is simply too much going on here — too many characters, too many foes, too many subplots, too many twists. More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just  meh. It's often hard to figure out what's going on and even harder to care, but whatever is happening, it's brought to you by Audi (when it's not brought to you by Gillette or Beats by Dre). Here and there, Whedon — the groundbreaking, genre-blending creator of the TV series ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Firefly"" — sneaks in glimmers of the snap and wit which have made him a major cultural force. Iron Man makes an aside about Eugene O'Neill, for example, which I'm guessing the vast majority of the giddy international audience won't get. When ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" takes a moment to catch its breath and allow the talented ensemble of actors to bounce off each other with self-aware smarts and charm, it's thoroughly winning. There's a party scene at Tony Stark's glassy lair in the sky which is just a complete blast to watch. Dressed in their civvies, the Avengers drink and joke with their friends and bust each others' chops. An amusing bit involving Thor's hammer has an amazing payoff later on in the film. It's enough to make you wish the entire movie could be like this: Imagine the Avengers, sitting around bantering rather than blasting bad guys. Whedon did a stripped-down, modern-day version of ""Much Ado About Nothing"" in his backyard, so why not? But alas, bad guys come. And there are so many of them. We're dropped in at the top in the midst of a massive siege on a fortress in some made-up Eastern European country. The camera-work is smooth and the stunts are tricky and the action is punishing, but it's all so big and glossy — and so obviously computer-generated — that it establishes an emotional disconnect from the very beginning. Yes, the characters originated in comic books, but this just looks cartoonish. Having saved the planet from the smarmy, preening Loki and his army of aliens, the Avengers must assemble once again to stop an accidental enemy: an artificial intelligence that Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) himself designed. His name is Ultron, and he's voiced with bemused menace by James Spader. (In an intriguing switch of their relationship in ""Less Than Zero,"" Downey is the one in control and Spader is the one causing damage.) The introduction of A.I. and its benefits causes an ethical divide among the Avengers: Captain America (Chris Evans), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Various supporting players from previous Marvel movies also show up briefly, including Cobie Smulders, Samuel L. Jackson, Stellan Skarsgard, Hayley Atwell and Idris Elba. But wait, there's more! Besides the threat of Ultron, the Avengers also must manage a pair of genetically enhanced twins who have a score to settle with Tony Stark: the speedy Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and the psychic Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). With the exception of a couple of pivotal moments, they weren't terribly necessary for the plot. They're also doing terrible Eastern European accents that suggest they'd rather be hunting moose and squirrel. Ultron also uses a super-strong metal — the same kind that comprises Captain America's shield — to form a army of mini-Ultrons, so that's a problem, too. It all feels frenzied and breathless, but Whedon's attempts at jamming in humanity end up seeming half-baked in contrast. Hawkeye gets an actual back story (as well as one great speech he delivers to Scarlet Witch in a reminder of the subtle strength of Renner's acting abilities) but it's more of an idyllic idea than a real life. Also hard to accept is the will-they- or-won't-they romance that forms between Hulk and Black Widow. Even with accomplished actors like Ruffalo and Johansson — both of whom are capable of great power and great sensitivity — this new-found relationship comes out of nowhere and makes no sense. If the high-tech issues ""Age of Ultron"" tackles interest you, though, there is a movie out there about the merits and threats of artificial intelligence which features tremendous performances and sharp writing and vivid special effects but about one one-hundredth of the cast: It's called Ex Machina. It's one of the year's best, and a shining example of how less truly can be more.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

","The biggest problem with basing the plot of your movie around fighting an AI, is that a true AI is unbeatable... a true AI is capable of simultaneously controlling all robotic facilities on earth, at the same time, and endlessly creating a perfect army of their own flawless design... you simply can't beat an AI. And that's where the plot-holes start in this movie: Ultron doesn't act like a true AI. Ultron makes mistakes, and he is endlessly inefficient. A true AI can launch all nukes on earth in an instant and smash all satellites in orbit around the earth into each other, thus stopping all communication on earth, OR even better, he could reroute all satellites to ONLY relay his own communications. So like I said, you can't beat a true AI, because the human race and even the avengers, are powerless without technology and if that same technology/weapons is used against them in the form of robots/nukes then the human race stands no chance in defending itself.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

","Let's compare this movie with X-men DOFP. We have Quicksilver in both, we have giant robots as enemies, we have fight within superhero group. All of this was done good in DOFO, and all was miss in AOU. Aside from that that in DOFP Quicksilver has much more better scenes, and that the way he moves is shown much better. In DOFP Quicksilver is a character. He likes some kind of music, he dresses in as he likes, he uses his powers in childish way (kleptomaniac), he plays with himself. What can you tell about Quicksilver in AOU? He has nice body, and hot sister. The reason why we do not feel anything when he dies is because we don't care for him. He's nobody. When agent Coulson dies in the Avengers, we feel something. Not because we like that guy. He's a menace. We hate him. But not in the way we want him to die. We care for him because he was so long with us. Because we remember who who is. We don't know who Quicksilver is. The other problem with Pietro and Wanda is that they are bad guys in the beginning of the movie. So why they couldn't stay bad for little longer, to make a real threat to our heroes? Because Marvel doesn't know what to do with bad guys. Baron von Strucker dies in the beginning of the movie without real reason. It reminds me of death of Count Dooku in Revenge of the Sith. And what about our main villain? He is not real threat to Avengers. Compare him to sentinels in DOFP and you will see how naive is he as a villain. By the way, why is the name of the movie Age of Ultron? Shouldn't it be Week of Ultron or something. In DOFP we watch our heroes die, some of them two times. And that deaths were horrible. In AOU we didn't even see Quicksilver dies. And now about fights within the team. Can you compare what is happening between Iron Man and Cap with the same thing between Magneto and Professor X? Hopefully we will see some blood in next year in Civil War. And that blood must be Caps. And he should stay dead. That is the only way for me to believe in these stories. That much is necessary to make believable these characters after so long avoiding tragedy. In addition, it is necessary because we will soon have Black Panther, Spiderman, Ant Man, Dr Strange etc. It is not possible just put more and more superheroes in movies. Marvel should think more about villains than about heroes. X-men have great villains – Magneto, William Sryker, Mystique, Sabetooth (the only good thing in that movie), sentinels etc. DC shared universe has already made one decent villain (better than all Marvels except Loki) and now with rebooted Lex and Joker, with big screen debut of Harely Queen, Deadshot and a bunch of lesser known villains DC will take back the throne of best superhero franchise from Marvel. Marvel is preparing for duel with Batman v Superman. That's the reason for Civil War. But Marvel is constantly forgetting that DC beats them with villains, and I don't see any villain in that movie, while DC is still hiding their true intentions with that movie. At the end of AOU we see new Avengers – the bunch of sidekicks and minor heroes we don't care for. Probably they are here only to be ready for Civil War.

","The newest addition to the Marvel comic universe falls short of some of the other recent releases. It has half the heart Guardians of the Galaxy had and even less compared to the plot of the Winter Soldier. The story feels like an afterthought and the stakes feel so much lower than they did in the first movie, even though they feel the need to constantly remind you that they ""might not make it out of this one"". Not everything is bad, The action is as good as any other large spectacle action movie and the acting is about as good as it gets for a comic book movie. The writing is hit or miss for most of the movie, and the funny banter between Avengers seems to die down toward the middle of the movie.It also has trouble finding its tone. One minute they want it to feel grounded and real, then the next minute you feel like you are watching a cartoon. The direction was unremarkable and Joss Whedons impact is felt less here than in the first movie. We may be getting spoiled with Guardians of the Galaxy and the second Captain America, but I expected much more from Age of Ultron. Every attempt to add personality to one of the characters that does not have their own separate movie feels forced and slows the movie down to a screeching halt. Finally what is up with the Hulk? First he is a reckless machine of destruction, not safe to be around unless you are basically a god. Then he can be calm and not punch everything he sees. One minute it takes some doing to get him to ""turn green"", but the next he can do it basically on a dime. Its lazy and bugs me to death. The first Avengers movie had problems, but it was awe inspiring to see all of this awesomeness on screen, but the sequel fails to reach that same peak.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

","Marvel has pulled off something INCREDIBLE – something unprecedented in the annals of American cinema! They have assembled the parts of four different movie franchises into a combination franchise – and it's a huge, HULKing success! Almost a decade ago, when I first heard of Marvel's plans to make separate movies about the Incredible Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America and Thor, and then bring them all together in an ""Avengers"" movie, I admit that I was a bit skeptical. I said to myself, ""Self, that's a lot of time, effort and money towards a single goal. I hope, for their sake, these movies don't suck."" I watched and waited to see if they could IRON out the details, and MAN, did they! The 2008 Hulk movie (2003's ""Hulk"" wasn't part of this grand plan), the three Iron Man movies and the Captain America and Thor films (two each) and 2012's ""Avengers"" have made a combined total of over $2.6 billion – in the U.S. alone! By the hammer of THOR, that's a lot of money! More importantly, these nine films (ten, if you count Marvel's ""Guardians of the Galaxy"") have averaged 7.4 stars on IMDb.com and an 82% audience rating on rottentomatoes.com! And now, writer/director Joss Whedon, the CAPTAIN of this culminating franchise, has given us a blockbuster that may break box office records in America and all over the world! Is Whedon's ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (PG-13, 2:21) worth all that? For the details (but no spoilers), and our official Movie Fan judgment, read on. The AVENGERS have ASSEMBLED! ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (as part of this grand plan for the Marvel Cinematic Universe) picks up on the cues and clues left us in ""The Avengers"". As the 2015 episode opens, Iron Man / Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), The Hulk / Dr. David Banner (Mark Ruffalo), Captain America / Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye / Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) are racing through the woods in the fictional Eastern European country of Sokovia, to a secret research laboratory where they hope to reacquire Loki's scepter. As we learned from the previous film, that staff has tremendous power and can't fall into the wrong hands. And in the right hands, it could be very beneficial. There's a rare stone within the scepter and that Stark realizes he can use to power Ultron, the artificial intelligence project that he's been working on. The idea is that Ultron would function as a global defense system to keep the world safe from aliens with bad intentions. ""Peace in our time,"" Stark calls it. The problem is two-fold. ""Peace in our time"" was the phrase used by British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain after he got Adolf Hitler to sign an agreement not to attack England and we all know how that turned out. Secondly, these guys have apparently never seen any of the ""Terminator"" movies, in which a defense technology called ""Skynet"" was supposed to keep earth's inhabitants safe and we all know how THAT turned out.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

","After the entire list of user reviews, all has been said. What more can be added to the many reviews? Not much. So basically the movie is enjoyable. There is no character development, not much of a story and there are many non-threatening robot type figures to smash and kill again. They have added romance, without it being romantic, and they have added more product placement and vague hints of potential story lines for upcoming Thor and Captain America movies. The Avengers is becoming a social gathering of heroes in between their own profitable movies. I very much enjoyed reading the Avengers comics books; much more than seeing the Avengers movies. This is disappointing considering I was looking forward to the movies after reading and collecting the Marvel Universe in the 70s and 80s. ",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015
798,24 April 2015,anupapu8,8," Entertainment but with Tried and Tasted method
","AVENGERS: AGE of ULTRON- Expectations were high to the limits and why wouldn't that be , The Avenger(first sequel) was such a entertaining flick. Everybody liked it , and it became the third highest grossing movie of all time only after Avatar and Titanic. So the first question is that is Age of Ultron is better then The Avenger for me the answer is 'NO' . 2nd Question can arise that is Age of Ultron is worth of spending money then my answer will be 'Hell YES'. The thing is that The First Avenger was first of its kind , before it we haven't seen such a grand super hero flick with so many super heroes (except in X Men which doesn't have famous super heroes individually). But the same formula cant be used twice. They should have done something new , but they haven't done that. The same tried and tasted formula has been used which although force you to get glued to your seat for the running time of the movie but will not force enough to remember it for a long time or to try repeat viewing. So the plot is simple - it starts with a fight , some celebration of wining , an experiment get wrong , a new A.I. villain takes birth who thinks the only way to brought piece is to extinct the humans and start it from a beginning. The villain tries to rip apart the avenger team , tension was created , some inspirational speech from Fury(Samuel L Jackson) and also from Hawkeye , the team is now united again and here comes the grand climax fight. What! Does it sounds familiar , of coarse it is , because Marvel overused this formula before. So why the movie is still good enough to watch on big screen spending extra money on 3d. So here's the truth is , very few people are there who expect depth and intelligence in story and screenplay of super hero movies for example like Batman series and Man Of Steel which DC comics is providing(because of which i am predicting that Justice League movies will be better then Avengers) and even X Men first class from Marvels was great. But most of the people just expect Great Action Sequences and chicky comic lines which Age of Ultron provides in a full amount. U will laugh a lot , Action pieces will make you saying WAOWWWW(still i think The Avenger and Man Of steel have better action sequences in their climax). Some interesting stuffs has been added to the movie like three new character - Javrish who is a good A.I. in the avenger's side doesn't get much to do this time but will be very important in the third sequel of Avenger i.e., Infinity of War, Second one is QuickSilver who runs really fast and his twin sister Scarlet witch. Scarlet has the power to born the fear in the mind of the thing any person is most afraid of(makes you remember Harry Potter movies). But the fears shown individually of the heroes are not so interesting. Hawkeye was the most uninteresting character from The Avenger , but gets the important job of reuniting the team in this sequel as showing why a normal human being without any extraordinary power is needed in the team. There was also some awkward romance in the film which will be good to see if i don't mention the characters. Joss Whedon is an entertaining director , but he didn't tried anything new , only tried to use the same old formula to make it a commercial success which it will definitely get. But the question is how long can the Marvel world can use the same formula. ? Is earning money is the sole target to them ? We will see it. 7.3/10 .

","Before I continue, or even start this review, I would like to acknowledge my bias. I love Joss Whedon. He is my absolute idol. Everything he has touched in the past 20 years has been incredible (that Alien movie notwithstanding). Hopefully that will also add a certain weight when I say this is my favourite Joss Whedon movie yet. What I have come to love about Marvel and their amazing universe is that they know how to have fun with a movie. They understand that 'comic book adaptation' and 'gritty cinematic experience' are not necessarily synonymous. Granted, this has a place in the broad spectrum that is cinema, and I don't necessarily condemn DC for their approach. However, Marvel's characters are perfectly suited for a movie where laughing in the middle of a battle scene is encouraged, not a precursor to sadistic tendencies. Every line of dialogue is perfectly crafted, whether it be a humorous quip or a simple interaction, revolving around a similarly fantastic plot and a villain I am confident is the best of the Marvel lineup so far. On a list also featuring Loki and the Winter Soldier, that's quite an achievement. Ultron is hilarious and badass and hilariously badass, with more depth than some of the human characters. Yet the star of this show, a show filled with incredible characters who individually command the screen every time it stops on them, the one who absolutely steals it is The Vision. A stunning character, brilliantly portrayed by Paul Bettany, with an incredible introduction. Seriously. This is not hyperbole. I have never wanted to clap in a movie theatre before, but the first scene with Vision very nearly drove me to do just that. I won't go into specifics, because everybody who has seen the film knows exactly what I'm talking about and everybody who hasn't seen it needs to understand how special it is firsthand. In summary, truly an amazing movie, due in part for it's ability to not take itself too seriously. Almost all of the characters have remarkable depth, and their individual personalities manage to shine through a densely packed lineup. Intoxicating action scenes, some of the best dialogue from the best wordsmith in the business and all of this makes for some pretty simple maths; Watch this movie. You will enjoy it.

If you are out for an action packed superhero movie you will probably have a good time at Avengers 2, but it will not stick with you as a classic. Add a dozen or so more superheros to the usual lot and you have people and creatures wielding all types of unexplained powers for reasons unknown.

There were a few moments of suspense, but even those had predictable outcomes. I enjoyed the Captain America films, and had hoped this would live up to those. However, it seemed like having numerous heroes spread the focus of the movie so far that it just becomes a muddled mess.

","It's my (not so) first review since i just wrote it and it's just gone before i submit it. Actually, I was late for the first 10 minutes, but thank God i was there before the 'AVENGERS' appears on the screen. I think this film is great from the appearing of Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch until Jarvis's oddly new body (and how worthy he is to be able to lifted the Mjölnir). Oh, and Thanos on post credit scene, again. I'm gonna start from how shocking and odd it is for Romanoff to be with Banner instead of Barton (and Barton has a family, it's sweet, BUT WHY). Also it's really exciting and not surprising that Nick Fury is there for the actual S.H.I.E.L.D. . I had this love-hate thing with how noisy Ultron is. Hate his attitude to the twins after they decided to do good and left him. I mean, why is he still kind he is a damn villain. And an A.I. . With feelings. Okay. Oh, and when he said he was about to destroy all of the mankind and the only thing left would be irons. HE LETS MAGNETO LIVE (I'm a big fan of x-men okay). Imagine if it happens and Magneto controls him and the other robots and everything since he's the only human left (ahh, Marvel universe). No. That would be terrible. I just love the connections. Alright. Thanks to Stark's (and Banner's big part on helping him, every time) secret project(s) for all these conflicts. Overall, this film is entertaining, I love the jokes. Especially when Dr. Cho is kind of attracted to Thor.

","Actually I thought the first avengers was a pretty decent movie. I heard AOU was a little more than ""disappointing"" from several reviewers. Why is the movie even called AGE of Ultron? Ultron has about as little affect upon the world or these characters as a common cold, and his influence lasts little more than the total runtime. Also, no character development. Strange leaps of logic. Generic characters with the same snarky, quip-laden, one-liner-prone personalities. Black Widow suddenly hitting on a man who is old enough to be her father. All, and there were many, the lazily written biblical references put in their in a slopshod attempt to lend some sense of pretentious importance and weight to an otherwise amusement park ride (Ultron says ""on this rock, I will build my church"", on vibranium? that's stupid). Another forgettable villain, another megalomaniac, world-destroying less-than-frightening ""bad guy"" without any gravitas or sensible, relatable motivation. Of all the creepy things on the internet, Ultron latches on to Pinnochio to express his diabolical menace... wat? I can't even... oh yeah, Disney. Also, expendable characters (I could tell *SPOILER* Quickie was gonna die half way through the movie, yet ironically his final line was ""bet you didn't see that coming""). Typical Marvel humor-drenched, drama-draining, suffocating presentation (I mean, *SPOILER* Quicksilver saved Hawkeye's life--like anybody cares about ol' beady-eyed Hawkeye--and Hawkeye just leaves him on the floor, doesn't cover him with a jacket or anything and delivers the brisk and incredibly callow line ""it's been a long day"" while he lies down right next to the guy who gave his life to save him without showing any kind of remorse or thankfulness.

","Avengers: Age Of Ultron is the best Marvel movie to date. While its run time is 2:12, it does not feel that long at all, in fact it felt like I was only in the theater for a fraction of the time. Right from the beginning we are treated to what Marvel does best, action sequences. The beginning of Ultron showcases each Avenger and each of their unique abilities in a way no one will forget. The movie is filled with humor, and you shouldn't leave the theater without having at least chuckled once or twice. The lulls in the movie are at a maximum only 10 to 15 minutes long each, then it sends you right back into the action. The whole movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and there is no shortage of good old Avengers fighting. The end is a bit similar to the end of the first Avengers in the sense that they are all fighting faceless enemies, but it doesn't hurt the movie at all. My only complaints about the movie would be the lack of screen time for both The Hulk and Ultron. The Hulk is one of my personal favorites, and while he is in one of the best scenes of the movie, it doesn't make up for the fact that he only has a maximum on 15 minutes screen time. Ultron, while he has more than 15 minutes, doesn't get enough time on screen to fully explain why hes doing what hes doing. While he briefly describes what his plan is and his motives, you are still left with only a very vague description. Ultron is such a cool villain you are left craving more of him, but sadly what we get is what we get. Over all i would give Avengers: Age of Ultron an 8/10.

","Avengers: Age of Ultron is action packed we jump right into the action, it's thrilling, exciting, and more importantly much more layered than I thought it would be. We all know these characters but what happened here is that we get to see them. Who they are and how they are when they're not protecting/avenging something. The first movie was basically the meet-up, ""the first day at school"" but now they all know each other, they've been working together for some time and you can feel and see it in this movie. Age of Ultron goes deeper with the relationship between the Avengers, and it goes deeper into the characters' personalities. Black Widow's back story is definitely the most interesting one, it gave her an emotional layer that she didn't really have.

","The question from the beginning was whether one could make a sequel, as good as the original. The Marvel specializes in successful sequel, either continuing the successful story, adding to tension, characters and plot, following the overall grand design of the company (e.g. Cpt. America: The Winter Soldier), or invest deliberately in their origin source i.e. the world of comics, which are the American version of mythology (e.g. Thor: The Dark World). The Greeks had Hercules, Americans have Superman, or Vision, the Cpt. Marvel etc., since we're referring to this particular company. Whedon, the man behind hits of modern American cinema (both artistic and commercial) having also credit for the screenplay, and without holding the position e.g. of Brad Bird, as the smoothest of narrators in an action movie, has a visible attribute that lends self-sarcastic humor in all his films, thus mitigating the possibility to be criticized by his accusers, for all the script excesses implied. This sense of humor has made his movies treasured by the two sexes. Because of this humor a grown man can easily enjoy a female, or a child movie (much a do about nothing, Toy Story), and a woman finds herself getting the ""pulse"" of an immature boyish movie(Avengers, Cabin In The Woods). All are in their positions, giving their best and giving moviegoers one more fine action movie to watch and cinema critics an action flick they can watch and praise without any remorse. This movie also gives to a comic buffer one more reason to feel proud for their childhood or teenage love, that was once mocked by some, but now is the biggest trend setter on the planet. With the small exception of the variation of the original comic story for obvious reasons (for the same reason that Marvel chose the Ant Man not to be Hank Pym or Captain Marvel to be a woman), serving Marvel's scheme a)to pass into eternity through cinema and b) to pass on to the younger generations who only read through tablets and therefore do not know the original material and are ready to accept anything. To that end the comic buffer stands alone as the largest and most strict judge. If he agrees with the whole effort, he will not grumble about the mind stone used to create the Vision, contrary to what has been written in comic books, nor that the Ultron, is the effective commander of Iron Legion and is essentially a fascist bastard, exact copy of his megalomaniac creator (which is implied and not explicitly mentioned in the film) and not an artificial intelligence that gets accidentally life from the same stone .. A huge festival special effects well shot and arranged unlike rather tedious action efforts (as eg was the 2nd episode of Star Wars), making good for its genre serving equally good the plot and the action, certainly well written, with interpretations as convincing as possible. In particular we must stand to the flirtacious Banner / Hulk - Romanov / Black Widow, who could give a comic buffer reasons to complaint, but serves the needs of the film and its promotion (must have female audience as well) and eventually do not harm the film,since both interpretations of Marc Ruffalo, and the (Goddess!!)Scarlett Johanson, is convincing and well placed within the mind blowing action sequences and the impending global threat. Now, it is time for the Gauntlet of Infinity (the last 2 films of Phase 3 of the Marvel Universe)..The 8/10 goes because it is sipmply impossible to outscore the first Avengers Movie..",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

On the flip side, the villain is unique, there are some good character moments and the inclusion of Scarlett Witch makes for some interesting scenes. However, these things can't elevate this film to more than 'good enough'. It's definitely not terrible and it's adequately made, but it just feels as if something is lacking to make us care more about the plot and characters. The film is certainly watchable, but it does nothing special to set it apart and therefore ends up being only a little more than average.

Aall of the scenes related to the 'main' plot involving Ultron, Strucker, The Maximoffs etc. were fine, no problem there. The problems arrive in the completely unnecessary and very tacked on sub-plots. A subplot involving a very poorly written romance between Hulk and Black widow that feels like it was written by a completely different author than the rest of the movie, and a bizarre subplot about Hawkeye not being there for his family and constantly alluding to remodeling his house? I'm sorry I just don't understand why either of these subplots were included except maybe to pad out the running time, or because people complained about Black Widow's and Hawkeye's seeming ""unimportance"" in the first film.

A comic book movie is only as good as its main antagonist relationship to the hero. When the antagonist can challenge a heroes moral code and force them into difficult choices we see their true character revealed. Ultron had potential to be action driven as well as an intellectually compelling story, unfortunately due to poor writing and voice overs the latter never came to fruition. I am personally more interested in seeing a story about morality, which the dark knight does so well. Unfortunately original story telling has taken a back seat to corporate greed in the entertainment industry.

I also thought the finale dragged, because it was just watching the Avengers smash robots who couldn't even give them any opposition.

The positives are that its really fun, has good characters, and a it is funny at times.

The plot is predictable with plain story, almost fell asleep in the middle! The Ultron idea is brilliant, but then it is a repetition of the first movie, exactly the same way. I was hoping they can dig down this artificial intelligent character, once again, the hope was raised in the beginning when Ultron found his consciousness and question himself, but after that...it's just another comic story, if he got the mind from Stark, why he's really against him, with his complication and intelligence, why choose the way and recreate the world, does it have to be like that all the time? I'm fine with whatever the end result is, just need more reasoning. However, this movie adds some human touches, and I kinda love it, the""normal"" family of Hawkeye, romance between Hulk and Black Widow, the testosterone fight between Thor and Tony comparing their partners, funny yet resemble to us, the not so strong nor intelligent human being :))",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

","Although the criticism of Ultron is entirely fair, he may be charismatic and a worthy foe. But how he was made is entirely out of nowhere. His motivation and conflict with the avengers are just shoved in the movie, and basically, he is just another baddie they have to destroy. And the general plot is a bit weak. Even though Joss made it seem fantastic on screen, it's somewhat barebones on paper. But the story beats like the action scenes and is excellently presented when the plot needs to get moving. I didn't have much of an issue with Ultron being weak in the movie. It is an issue but never bothered me that much. With that said, the themes of heroes' struggles and fears are extraordinary. Thanks to Wanda, this brings interesting character development moments for everyone. Even Hawkeye has a great character moment. And the conflict they had with each other is an excellent setup for Captain America Civil War. Also, this movie was the debut of Wanda and Vision. Wanda provides a naïve perspective of things, and watching her grow as a hero is satisfying. And Vision coming to life to be this organized being is unexpected but welcomed. This movie may have a bad reputation with its villain and plot, but the Avengers took a different and more profound look at each other. The themes were terrific, but they could've been better developed within the story. But overall a worthy sequel to the first Avengers and still shows their fantastic chemistry.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

","Avengers: Age of Ultron was a great sequel and a great addition to the Marvel movies. There seemed to be a good balance between action scenes and getting to know the characters on a more personal level. I thought it was interesting to see Black Widow and Bruce Banner ""toe the line,"" if you would, on a personal relationship and professional one. I also like the way she was able to calm The Hulk down when his services were no longer needed. I don't want to sound sappy, but I'd like to see if their relationship goes further in the next movie, assuming that The Hulk is just MIA at the movie's end, nothing more. It's too bad that the X-men and Fantastic Four movies are produced by 20th Century Fox, and Spiderman is through Columbia. It'd be great to see all three series cross over.

I was not a fan of the first film as I felt that film was underwhelming and the ending was a complete copy of Transformers: Dark of The Moon, but unlike the first film the story does not flow evenly like the last film. The film felt like it was all over the place like you were watching random scenes thrown together. I truly believe they pushed for more constant eye candy then an actual coherent story. There are some things I really enjoyed. I liked Ultron the most. Ultron was an awesome villain in the film. Part of me was actually rooting for Ultron. Vision was awesome as well. His look was immaculate and he had a great screen presence. Both were strong characters and helped the film. I also liked how Quicksilver and The Scarlet Witch looked, but I hate how they altered their origin story and their accents were God awful.

","Avengers: Age of Ultron is the Marvel Studio's movie equivalent to Hulk. It is big, fierce and green (translates to a lot of money), yet it is devoid of any real emotional component. The stakes are definitely higher as our favorite band of superheroes team up once again to take down another noteworthy adversary: Ultron. Unlike previous enemies in the MCU, the mischievous robotic creature voiced by James Spader, was created by error from the tasteful mind of Tony Stark. Ultron's inception was triggered by Dr. Banner's and Mr.Stark's dream of upholding world peace- well not exactly. Their ambitions were misplaced; when they decided to pursue the route of artificial intelligence and integrate it in Stark's already existent peacekeeping program (controlled by Jarvis). When things take a turn for the worse, Ultron misbehaves and chooses to go out on a bender to destroy mankind rather than protect it. ",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

They don't always get along, and all of the scenes with them assembled are not amazing, but this is more of what you expect with a team. Some of the scenes I enjoyed the most were scenes where they resembled normal folk. Scenes where they are partying or hanging out, or even in an old farmhouse with Hawkeye's (Renner) family; moments that focused on their humanity. Because for the most part, there isn't a lot of humanity shown otherwise. Part of the problem with superhero movies is finding an adequate challenge, and putting the main character in danger. In many popular comic book movies, ""Iron Man"", ""Wolverine"", and ""Thor"", all of these characters are stripped of the powers and they have to figure things out as a somewhat normal individual. In Avengers 2, there is no imminent threat felt, even though it is implied. While it's not a bad movie by any means, the Avengers seem to be overstaying their welcome at the moment. It's up to the Russo brothers (Captain America 2, and currently directing Captain America 3, and then both Avengers sequels) to get things back on track.

Aside from the witty banter and some ass kicking (that's Amazing Ass kicking, btw) what does the second installment of Avengers have? Even the so called immortals, even the gods who took upon themselves as the saviors of mankind have weaknesses. it is in these moments of weakness, pushed into desperation while trying to achieve a permanent peace chaos is born. What these saviors fail to understand is peace and chaos are not two different things. Yet, there is grace in their failure(sic). There is a subtle drama in this movie that blew my mind more that any other aspect of it. True, I am really excited about how this movie segues into the rest of the cinematic universe. But, more than that I like the way Cap, who is supposed to be the conscience of the team wavers from believing what is right or wrong. I like how Tony, Nat, Thor and Bruce all show their vulnerabilities and Clint the person you least expect walks into the middle with far greater purpose and courage than the rest of the team combined. The Avengers are supposed to be earth's greatest defense. That defense wavers because they shown their greatest weakness. A climbing mistrust of each other. They pulled thru this time but only time will tell if they learnt their lesson. This is what the second installment has in store. A new road to be paved while picking pieces of their own sins.

It features some amazing performances from all the main cast, with Jeremy Renner being the standout as he finally had something to do! I particularly enjoyed Bruce and Natasha's romance, because it felt real. It didn't feel like it was being forced at all, like it was with Captain America or Hawkeye (Natasha has a great love life.) James Spader as Ultron is just so incredibly awesome, he is the best villain I have seen in a film for ages, and definitely the best marvel villain (sorry Loki fans, Ultron is better). Joss Whedon has a flawless direction, and I'm really sad that he's leaving the franchise, but I can't wait to see the Russo's take.

I think an asteroid, a mere 1.5 kilometers in width, brought down from space at 45,000 kph will have enough kinetic energy to lay waste to mankind. Not as spectacular nor as cinematic as Ultron's ""raising a city"", and there's no chance for the Avengers to waste their time saving civilians, but it's a sure thing. In Gurren Lagann, (one of my favorite anime now) the Anti-Spirals planned to send the moon down to earth. That's a 3,500 km in diameter sphere from a distance of 365,000 km away.

979,3 May 2015,anchoreddown,9," One great thrill ride.
","For some reason, or another this film seems to have a mixed bag of reviews, some love it while others hate this piece. Want an honest review??? When the studio reached the 'point of no return' by getting to The Avengers, it was the first Marvel film to reach the billion dollar mark. Up until this point, most of the Marvel based films received good reviews. What went wrong?? It seems to always be the common denominator, the audience. Movie goers seem to get more nit-picky of films that have background material these days. They keep praying that the producers keep 'messing up' on their favorite comic book characters. However, I mean no disrespect to anyone. This being said, it puts more pressure on the studios to do their job right. This is why films like Spiderman 3 failed to bring full force is because Sam Raimi could not give the script he wanted full treatment. Now that I have laid down some ground in the way Nick Fury would, as if talking to the team, here's my review of this movie. It's good to see new and old faces. With the grouping of the characters in Age Of Ultron, it's difficult to really put character emphasis on any one or two superheroes. We know the ones we've already seen in the Marvel Universe. Once again, this is part of the start of phase two in the writing process of both the films and Agents Of Shield. We got to see the alien life force from the first Avengers, so it makes sense that Age Of Ultron would have robots to accompany Ultron himself, seeing that he has to upload himself to a machine in the first place. This also eludes to the reveal that Marvel fans will eventually get of Thanos. Not only that, but now Spiderman will be able to join the roster again. Everybody knows that Agent Colson is still alive, so we have yet to see him show up again, but more than likely, will stay with Shield. What makes this film special?? I think it's the Scarlet Witch who taps into the minds of others, making them face their fears of their past. Bottom line is, don't let anyone tell you what you should and shouldn't watch. Sometimes you have to test the waters,......trust me, if you relax and sit back you just might enjoy this piece of film you may call 'a piece of crap'.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

","As the title to my review suggests, Age of Ultron is not a terribe movie, but the consensus I'm hearing the most is that it could not realistically live up to the hype and quality of the first avengers. I agree with this but I do believe it could have been better than it was. First off, there was little to no dramatic tension in my opinion,(I've indicated a spoiler warning) the death of quick silver in my opinion did not do anything to push forward the plot of the movie or help in the least bit in establishing a darker tone. It followed too closely the same formula as the first film and even had a more likable, interesting and entertaining villain. Ultron felt too much like a generic evil robot, and I personally find he had no personality, and was not menacing, instead he reminded me more of a twisted version of tony stark with a lot of the same sarcastic charm and wit, but again with an evil twist. Other than the action scene with ironman facing the hulk, many of the other moments felt a bit sloppy especially the last act with bullets explosions and metal flying all over the place. It simply wasn't engaging and was a bit frustrating to follow, some more emphasis was given to other characters that didn't get their time to shine from the last film, this was not well complimented with side plots that felt needless and unnecessary. Some new character introductions notably vision were quite sweet, as well as other easter eggs like mentioning wakanda, and a Ulysses klaw cameo were also pleasant, the film itself felt a bit too much like a set up for future events and lacked focus. My last comment, turning a small city into, pretty much a meteor...I guess clever but uuhh...no. Overall not a bad movie, the characters were fine and again the easter eggs and references were pleasant and it did have a great stand out fight scene as mentioned earlier, So it gets a 7 in my books.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

The 3D is also extremely cool, most namely the opening action scene, which had a shot that got butterflies in my stomach. The comedy is consistently laugh-out loud funny, especially the Hulk gets punched several times one(the whole entire theater was laughing like crazy when that came along). I was also impressed by Ultron, who is both a ruthless villain who wants to destroy the world and a lovable robot that cracks several funny jokes.

","Joss Whedon delivers his swan song in the Marvel cinematic universe with more of the same that made the first Avengers fun. Admittedly, although this is supposed to be setting up phase 3 leading to 2018/2019's Avengers: Infinity War parts 1 & 2, it is painted on a decidedly smaller canvas than its predecessor. Aside from a brief jaunt to a metaphysical realm for Thor, almost all of the action is earth bound. No Alien juggernauts or floaty asteroid realms here, folks. No Loki. And it really does feel like more of the same. The hordes of more or less identical Chitauri from the first flick are replaced by hordes of ACTUAL identical robots to serve as the cannon fodder. And fist fodder. And laser fodder, and lightning fodder--you get the idea. Some of the same beats are repeated, too, with the obligatory Avenger vs. Avenger smackdown in the second act. The interplay between the characters is where its heart is at, and is really Whedon's forté. There's a blossoming romance, some nice back and forth banter. The odd one-liner that's worth a chuckle or two. Like I said before: more of the same. My biggest complaint comes into the money shots; Whedon's whirlwind shots of all the Avengers standing together, facing down the faceless robotic hordes left me a little overwhelmed--there was so much happening so fast--debris flying, lasers shooting, lightning, bullets, arrows, people, robots-- it honestly felt for a moment like a Michael Bay Transformers flick overload assaulting my senses. And he's still doing those damn ugly dutch angles just to squeeze all the action into the frame sometimes. But did I enjoy it? Yes mostly. Even if I felt I had seen most of it before in the first flick (also, Superman Returns immediately came to mind when Ultron puts his plan into motion). Ultimately though, I am glad Whedon is handing over the reins, because you can feel that he's not as hungry with his second serving as he was with his first.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

The movie felt a little crowded, but it's the Avengers--you obviously have to have all of them. Whedon's trademark humor is definitely present, and provides a nice balance to the darker story lines going on. But something felt very off with a lot of the characters' motivations. It felt like we were missing something vital about their thought processes, and their subsequent decisions were somewhat jarring and the bickering between characters was more grating than entertaining.

Joss Whedon knew what he was doing to work on the story, made a few changes that are not exactly right to the comics but it fits to the story.

I needn't have been so concerned; Marvel has successfully developed the characters of this (unlikely) team and added new elements such that the audience bask in the familiarity yet still enjoy the fresh chemistry of interactions among them. The ""creation"" of Ultron was natural given the megalomanic nature of Tony Stark - this somehow bringing out the moral that good intentions lead to hell - and the divergence and reaction of the team in face of self-created disaster was powerful drama. Since Ultron was too strong an adversary, allies and additions to the Avengers were necessary and these turns in the story did not, fortunately, have an artificial ""forced"" feeling to them. An interesting point was the twins were in fact characters from other tales of the Marvel universe, and Thor's hammer and ""worthiness"" was a recurrent joke. The use of stunts (given that Scarlett Johansson was eight months pregnant in the later part of filming) was masterly, and the resolution of the endgame crisis was much more realistic than other Marvel movies - with casualties, wounded hearts and broken spirits. Very good entertainment and I look forward to the next one in the series - did the post-credit scene suggest a marriage between the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy I wonder?

Unlike dc they deal with consequences of actions, individuality, and expressing who you are and what you believe in while dc films at their best have pushed propaganda for major corporations made excuses for government spying and the desecration of our constitution.

","Age of Ultron, I'm fairly sure, is exactly whatever you're expecting it to be. If you're a fan of the humour and the first Avengers in particular, you'll of course love this one as much, if not more. However, if you're like me and weren't sold on the first one, then you're probably in for more of the same. AOU promises a darker tone, The Empire Strikes Back of the eventual Avengers quadrilogy if you will. Despite this, the film lacks any suspense given that we know our superhero pals will be coursing back onto our screens for their next dozen blockbusters over the next few years. Not to mention the more dramatic tone, or lack thereof, as every scene feels inconsequential, with the Avengers playfully joking about as we wait for the next fight; fights which should spell danger and anxiety for them. additionally, sub-plots are picked up and never expanded upon. Why is Nick Fury suddenly popping up in the middle of the film, offering nothing plot or character wise? Why did Black Widow flirt with Bruce once at the start of the film only for the next time we see them together for them to be in a relationship? The film was originally 3 hours+, and it's blatant that important, character developing scenes have been cut out (that being said, if you're willing to wait I'd guarantee the director's cut of the film to be more satisfying). ultron is a menacing and worthy foe to the Avengers, and his screen presence is fantastic, however his motivations seem shaky at best and his intentions to cleanse the world seem weak, considering the story revolves around his might. despite these flaws, Age of ultron is a good film and a worthy sequel to The Avengers. It's more of the same, but in a good way. The action scenes are of course amazing and breathtaking at times, if a little suspense-less. The scenes with Quiksilver are brilliant, and overall some of the set pieces in the film are a wonder to behold, especially the opening tracking shot of all the Avengers together. Overall, this film is good, not great, as with so many Marvel movies as of late. Go and see it, it'll entertain you.

","That - wouldn't happen. A virtual identity called Ultron tries to eradicate the Avengers. Crucially, Tony Stark himself created the lethal foe. That wouldn't happen because several organisations would already have formed that only revolve around shutting down the Stark Towers, for exactly that situation. Captain America in particular gets to know Tony Stark in 'Avengers Assemble.' A more likely scenario should be that Cap pulls his cell phone and tells Fury (their leader) to pull the plug on the Stark Tower. By the time this movie happens, he should have secretly invested all his spare time to figure out the Stark Tower and its weaknesses. Probably power supply. But then again, Cap evidently isn't much of a secret agent. Maybe they gave that serum to the wrong person. There is a reason why Natasha Romanov has to make do with the Hulk as a partner. Because Cap as a partner would get her killed. Instead of keeping the relationship a secret, he probably would show off in front of Tony Stark. Coming back to the movie, Ultron would get hold of that relationship, too, and just has to take Romanov hostage. Cap even drops a stupid comment on the tete-a-tete between Romanov and Banner (Hulk's alter ego). A movie later, in Captain America: Civil War, Romanov picks Stark's faction over Cap's, at first, and then sides with Cap, anyway. Cap would have been the obvious choice from the beginning if he wasn't useless, as exposed in this movie.

",Avengers Age of Ultron is likely going to be the best experience I've had in a theatre this year and it is the best I've had in a long time. This is just a fun film. All of the main cast members of the original film return for the sequel and the chemistry is as good as ever. The comedy is great I love the jokes that are scattered throughout the movie. Robert Downey Jr is of course amazing as Iron Man but he is just so funny in this movie and this is probably the funniest I've seen him. One of the downsides of the original film is there is not quite enough Hulk but there is lots of him in this film. The action sequences are amazing and there are so many stunts in the film that leave you in awe. Hawkeye gets more attention in this film as well and we learn more about his character which only makes the movie better. After this movie Hawkeye may not be considered the dud Avenger. Plus there are great classic performances from Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson. Now there are also some new additions which I think are all added well and all are good strong characters. Quicksilver was certainly an interesting character I liked the effects they used when he ran and I also enjoyed Scarlet Witch who has already been confirmed as a returning character in the future. Then we have Vision who is amazing but doesn't get as much screen time as I would like but will likely play a bigger part in the coming films. Finally we have the villain Ultron. Ultron was not what I expected but he was not a disappointment either. James Spader does an excellent job for the voice but when I watched the trailer it looked like Ultron was going to be a villain we could love that was dark and complex. He is more sarcastic and funny than anything. I liked Ultron but I did not love him. The only other problem I have with this movie is I thought it needed to be longer. Director Joss Whedon has said already that the film was originally 3 hours long but 40 minutes were cut. I hope that when the film is released on DVD and Blu Ray we will get a chance to see the directors cut and I may even enjoy it more. This movie could very well be my personal favorite Marvel film and so far it is my favorite movie this year.

1091,30 January 2023,njdevils-75205,4," Not that different from mediocre Television
","The first Avengers film was not quite a good movie, but it was a marvel of narrative efficiency with Whedon job mostly reduced to keep as many balls rolling as he can while adding some grace notes in the sidelines (in some ways it was the high point of early Marvel aesthetics of combining a bland surface and undervalued quirk personalities to add some flavor to it, a formula they seem to have mostly abandon this past 2 years after deciding people enjoy those bland surfaces well enough). Age of Ultron is a good deal more ambitious which unfortunate is part of its limitations. The plot is more character based with Whedon putting a futile earnest effort to serve a dozen actors well and there's some genuine desire to dig into American exceptionalism (not always with success) and build things around its characters eminent loneliness. The final result is just a huge mess, it is both overlong and feels like at least half hour worth of connective scenes that needed to be there got cut. It has no sense of how to move from one big setpiece to the next. Plots that are important either seem to come out of nowhere or get dropped without resolution, for instance it is good to see Whedon actually trying to do something with Iron Man's past as an arms merchant but I can only assume a big scene between him and the twins end up on the cutting room floor and without the whole subplot goes nowhere (overall this ilm seem to equal givenhints of things of actually use them to add depth). The action is way too chaotic and this is such a comic book film it often confounds angsty melodrama for character work. There is way too much heroes fighting heroes scenes (that said the nerd inside me will never be against the 50 year honored Avengers tradition of Iron Man trying to take a short cut, Captain America getting all self-righteous about it, they coming to blows and Thor getting to settle it). The last act is very questionable politically, but it is good to get a Marvel film that at least puts some actual stakes into saving people over simple destroying things. I also enjoy how Whedon uses Hawkeye's guy with a bow and arrow number to ground the action even if his script gets to cute overexplaning what he is doing. If this felt under control it might have amount to something but as it stand it is the a lot of cliff notes that go nowhere.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

","Alright coming into this movie after reading the countless user reviews I had doubts, but I'll tell you first hand. All of those doubts were shattered six ways over. We'll start with the directing. Directing: Holy hell, does this movie look good, and better than its predecessor. If it's amazing group shots with awesome camera work, or just the dialogue scenes. After seeing the first two trailers, I thought the color tone looked really dull. It's not. The colors are bright where they need to be, and dark when they need to be. Acting: Standard Acting (which is a high standard coming from Marvel) Everyone is great in their roles. Leaves nothing to be desired. Writing: Near flawless witty dialogue, with only a few jokes that don't stick. VERY FEW. This movie can get very dark at times in terms of writing. Especially when they decide to dive into the origins. More on that later. Score: I nice subtle score, not to crazy, not to quiet. Leaves a bit to be desired. (Since this movie is primarily character driven I'll put a section for the characters) Characters: Origins Explored,and Developments Made. Hawkeyes gets the most development out of the group. Mostly because he had little to none in the first. Black widow has two different interesting story lines in this movie. 1: Her dark origin 2: her growing relationship towards Bruce. The hulk is the same as last time but still decent. Same can be said for cap. Ironman's storyline is quite similar to IronMan 3. Thor is basically his same old good self. The twins (Scarlet Witch, and Quicksilver) are really likable and surprisingly HUMAN. Ultron... okay I'll just go ahead and say it. He's the best villain since Heath Ledger's joker. He's Charismatic, funny and at the same time, Uncomfortably menacing. Props to James Spader. There is one character that I haven't mentioned but I'll let you have fun with that Verdict: By all means A Good Sequel, not perfect but good. It improves on the weaknesses,and strengthens the good parts of the original. Not to mention successfully and smoothly introducing 4 different likable characters.

","Well, First let me state that I am not a comic fan boy, but Iam a huge Whedon fan. I went into this with high expectations, and the action, scope, visuals, sound, and writing (maybe one too many one-liners) fulfilled all expectations. I was bummed by three things that are the caused of my below excellent rating. The performances aren't knocked out of the park, and are kind of distant. No one really struggled to act. I think the actor giving the best performance was Spader and his character is all CGI. Probably think with Guardains being so praised last year, this movie was edited to work on that pace, which works great for James Gunn. But I welcome more development with Whedon written characters and sets. so when these people stand in a room, its not filled rhetoric, there ought to be great ideas and explanations. Thirdly (not a spoiler because these appearances were listed in credits) there were so many secondary characters from other films that appear but are hardly used that I just go, stop it already. But ya know. Whedon and along with Nolan, Wright, and Tarantino seem tapped into not just what movies are today but where they are going. ",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

The Avengers was a worldwide phenomenon back in 2012, it became the third highest grossing film of all time, and it established Marvel as the powerhouse of blockbusters. What was so successful in the first installment of The Avengers was its ability to bring so many stars together for one film. Director/writer Joss Whedon had managed to gather the likes of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). For the second go round, Whedon had a more challenging task of appealing to comic fan-boys, cinematic critics, and the stars themselves (with the every growing cast, screen time is becoming more difficult to administer), all while topping the first film. However, Whedon has magically managed to pull off a film that achieves a kind of balance in all of these aspects with the second installment of The Avengers, The Avengers: Age of Ultron.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

Avengers: Age of Ultron does not disappoint for that matter, lol i saw earlier some review that said this movie was bland........you're kidding me right?! Action packed right out of the gate, and keeping it fresh with the new villain Ultron, and other new characters. The thing that I personally like about AoU over Avengers 1 is it didn't feel slow like the first 2/3rds of the first film, now talking about the epic ending battles... I think the final battle of New York was just a tad better, just a tad, because lets face it when Bruce went hulk and put his stop sign of a fist to the giant chitauri carrier, everybody in the world was like...this is a dream come true! And Age of Ultron gives me that feeling, but I don't know thats how hard it is to decide, but mark my words the battle against Ultron is not going to disappoint what so ever!! As for my final point: the acting! Robert Downey Jr. Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, Chris Hemsworth all get their equal share in this movie and all are as great as usual! Aaron Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen are very good as the siblings of Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch, and the fans i think will really enjoy Paul Bettany as the Vision...but the stand out of this film is James Spader as Ultron, sinister yet the humor is there for a great combination to an awesome and next to Tom Hiddleston maybe the best Marvel villain on film ever!

Taking this into account, I'd say this sequel is on a par with the original. Each scene segues seamlessly into the next and there's the perfect mixture of humor, drama and eye-popping adventure. We are not only treated with the usual top- quality eye candy (in this case, a peek inside the Avengers Mansion, the Hulkbuster armor and the Scarlet Witch-induced nightmares, just to name a few) but also great dialog and relationships. Yes, relationships are the core strength of this movie, as seen on the scene where they just relax sipping a drink and bet about who is worthy enough to lift Mjölnir, or when Cap gives love advice to Bruce.

","Another year, another Marvel movie, and this time, the heroes are facing their greatest threat yet...A hype train. Last year's one-two punch combo of ""The Winter Soldier"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" sees the studio sitting on a pile of money and critical praise. Now comes the sequel to the Avengers. It brings the earth's mightiest heroes, Iron Man, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Hulk, and Thor together again, and this time they're fighting the biggest baddie of them all: Ultron(James Spader), intent on making a city into a comet to evolve humanity by destroying it...or something. James Spader was a fantastic choice, and his menacing voice and evilly pompous personality could make for a great villain...if the end didn't come down to him splitting himself into multiple copies, and having those copies attack everything that moves. For the smartest Avengers villain yet, his plan is remarkably similar to EVERY OTHER ONE. Ultron is aided by Scarlet Witch(Elizabeth Olson) and Quicksilver(Aaron Taylor Johnson) who both do serviceable as both lesser bad guys and reluctant heroes. They are, however, hindered by some bad Russian accents. From the opening scenes, it's clear that the formula of dialog from the first Avengers film is still here. That's great. Witty banter gives way to strangely thought-provoking statements, and some cutting-edge meta humor thrown in there for good measure. Joss Whedon(Creator of Firefly, Buffy, and Angel) is a master at this sort of thing, and he's back in his element. In fact, the standout scenes in the movie are the quiet ones. Hawkeye's conversation with someone very special who I will not reveal, Ultron's many monologues that bounce between philosophical and hilarious, and a fantastic party scene all come to mind. There are bits of dialogue in this film that sound like poetry, like when Ultron comments that he enjoys the ""geometry of belief"" in reference to a church being in the center of a town. However, the problems come from his trying to re-create the magic of the first film too much. The opening action scene is all shot in the one-take style that made the final scene of the 1st film so memorable. This time around, it's hindered by bouncy CGI, especially where Thor is concerned. His hammer doesn't look like it's connecting with anything, and the laws of physics are so bent that everything begins to feel pointless. This stuff is absolutely unacceptable in a movie of this size. It's refreshing that the film isn't too dark, like the trailers suggest, because that's not what these films are supposed to be. However, it certainly looks dark. The vibrant colors of Avengers 1 are replaced with drab yellows and whites that look good in Fincher films, not summer blockbusters. The issue of battle fatigue that films like ""Guardians"" have so masterfully avoided rears it's ugly head in ""Ultron."" Instead of a thrill ride, the final action scene is a slog, with almost no audience reaction in my theater. The cast is in fine form, and their chemistry is palpable...except for the most out of left field romance I've seen in a film of this kind. Bruce Banner and Black Widow's dialogue and actions toward each other are about as subtle as a punch from the Hulk, and about as well-written. There are other problems too, some plot holes, some storytelling. Overall though, fanboys will love it, casual fans like me will have fun, but the joy stops there, something that could not be said about Guardians, Cap 2, or the 1st Avengers.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

Ultron was the best villain of Marvel phase 2 but his creation and character could have been fleshed out more and that would have added to this film.

","I really enjoyed the first Iron Man and Captain America. Unique. Good plotting. Good script. Then the sequels began and CGI a flash-bang took over. This one bored me from the start. The troops storm the castle. Been there, seen that. Tony Stark's ego expands until it bursts on the screen like an over-expanded bowel, and he creates Ultron without doing his homework. The rest was so snoring that I quit when Ultron joins the bad guys. I could care less about any of the characters by then. They opened Pandora's Box and now everyone has to live with it.

","I have been waiting since last summer for an movie which can be satisfactory. But after watching AOU, the wait continues. This movie has humor. The action sequences in the first half satisfies an adrenaline junkie but the climax fight is a huge letdown. The romantic angle seems forced. Overall a disappointing affair. You should watch it once for the epic battle between IRON MAN and the HULK. Captain America had a decent role while hawkeye's character gets explored. Thor seems to have developed humor which is enjoyable. Director Joss Whedon seems to have not developed the climax. A pretty engaging first half. Slow in the middle.

","what do you do when you have a big story to tell and a short window. You cut to the chase and start with a BANG. That's exactly what you'll get when you put on the 3D glasses and start watching the Avengers: Age of Ultron. It's a bit darker than it's predecessor yet the amount of humor in it is sure to keep the mood light. The movie gives up close and personal look inside the lives of the Earth's Mightiest Heros. Less talk more action. So, what does 9 superheros in one screen fighting together look like ? Let me put it like this, I've never, ever seen action this intense in any movie. But it's not lengthy nor is it repetitive. The first two fights go on like the first 3 gears in bike, then when it turns to the finale - it reaches top gear with utmost urgency and keeps on gaining pace. It has so much and more that it makes the fight scenes in the first avengers look like a long trailer. The only thing I didn't like was that Ultron wasn't as intimidating as he should have been. One than once his reactions seems humane. And how in the hell did he get tele kinetic powers ??? A definite summer blockbuster. Age of Ultron is supposed to tie up lots of loose ends between the first movie and Infinity Wars and it shows. The plot has too much content in one go. Introduction of quicksilver and Scarlet witch, creation of Ultron and vision, the mind stone, mentions of wakanda and Claw(relating to Black Panther), last but not least Thanos acquiring the infinite gauntlet. #sigh #NERDgasm A war is never without causalities and I praise the movie for being realistic. Although the sciences mumbo-jumbo stuff is also present to patch up the unexplainable glitches but that obviously comes with comic book movies. Last time they tried to teach us real science through a movie, science ended up getting his butt kicked into a wormhole and dropped in a bookshelf and again in a black-hole and ...aaaah it still creeps me out.

","No surprise that this film was one of the most anticipated movies of the year. Coming in at about $191 million US Box Office opening weekend doesn't hurt either. But I can honestly say Age of Ultron lacks the superior storyline and memorable moments of the original Avengers. The action scenes were great and visuals were spot on but they could not top the Hulk smashing Loki scene or even the Hulk transformation right before dispatching the Chitauri worm. My favorite moment would have to be the Iron Man/Hulk fight scene with the Hulkbuster armor. There were some things that bothered me, I didn't really care too much for the romance between the Black Widow and Bruce Banner....c'mon Marvel you can do better than this, that was pointless. The introductions of its new characters felt rushed. The reasoning and creation of Ultron lacked development given that he was evil from the beginning. Ultron is humanized to the point that he felt like just another everyday robot villain. The Vision is unveiled and lacked more screen time, of which he deserved. I understand there is only so much time allotted for this film but these are key characters. Comparing this film to the source material that was the comic books, the changes in this movie were noticeable . And that is just the thing, if I were a 10 year old (or just ignorant to the comic books) I may have liked this movie more, after all that is the market. The plot was not as solid as I would have liked but it still gets tied together at the end of the movie. Overall Age of Ultron is good but not great, especially when compared to the first Avenger film. Joss Whedon was able to balance all these characters to the point that the film comes together despite some obvious time constraints. We can only wait with anticipation and see what the Infinity War films will have in store for us. 3 out of 5 stars.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015
1244,12 March 2016,ohad-84719,10," Avengers: Age of Ultron
","Let's just start in that ""Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is truly the biggest Marvel movie sequel to date. It has lots of excellent action sequences ,battles and more ,But most of all was the titular Ultron, He is actually an evil rogue robot android and he is totally funny villain ,In his terrifying and eccentric performance ,James Spader give us what Tom Hiddleston's partly-dumb villain Loki in the previous film didn't gave us and it is fun and a real scheme. Ultron's scheme is definitely to eradicate human race and replace them with his robotic army and then to take over the Earth ,as all comic book villain does. However, Loki wanted to rule over Earth and humanity in order to become a king ,what he didn't got in the first ""Thor"" in 2011. AOU also has a great cast job not only by the original Avengers from the first film ,and not only by Samuel L Jackson's SHIELD Director Nick Fury ,but also Aaron Taylor Johnson who already starred as a superhero in the two ""Kick-Ass"" films ,this time ,he returns as a real superhero ,alongside the beautiful Elizabeth Olsen ,and then we have the excellent Paul Betanny who gave us voice acting for JARVIS in the three Iron Man films and in the previous film of the Avengers ,but this time ,JARVIS becomes Vision ,a powerful android created by our funny movie antagonist ,and he gives us not also worthy to the Asgardian mighty big bodied blonde Avenger's Mjolnir hammer but also shows us an android with sympathy and human features. The fantastic film music by the excellent Brian Tyler and by Danny Elfman ,who composed already two Marvel films (""Spider- Man"" and ""Spider-Man 2"") ,shows us what the great Alan Silvestri didn't succeeded to renew ,and the duo are doing it in so equal and epic way. For ending ,Avengers: AOU is definitely the biggest and excellent Marvel movie to date maybe more than its first proceedor ,and maybe more than the other MCU films that we saw years prior. Rating: 10/10 - It is an epic superhero movie about unity ,team work and back-to-back help when the things turn wrong.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

","I'm not that old but I grew up with superhero comics and TV shows. Ultron is story/character I have been waiting to see on the big screen for quite a while. After the first Avengers movie I gained an understanding as to what Marvel movies have evolved into. I define them as the movies you want to see just for the entertainment. There is no underlying message conveyed. There is no remark to current social issues. But you get to feel like Michael Bay in a store dedicated to the selling of explosives. I would only recommend to my friends to watch this movie in theatres, or on a very big screen with surround sound. This movie got the adrenaline pumping, but the classic marvel cheesy shots just don't do it for me. For example in the opening scene when they are attacking the base, and there is that slow-mo shot of all the avengers in a mid-air attack. I also still don't understand how Blackwidow is able to take out the Ultron bots with her little guns and ""kung fu."" I'd like to see a marvel MOVIE with proper immersion of the character into society, where there are real consequences. To be honest Daredevil is so far my favourite from all of their productions, but I'd love to see them take that show and use it as a template for their movies.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

His scenes, though limited were very entertaining and fun to see progress. Hulk/ Bruve Banner was a very weak character oh my gosh was his and Black Widows romance ever forced.as expected there was amazing CGI through the film. It really took the glass to reality in some scenes. Andy Serkis's cameo was cool to see but it was short lived and felt obligatory. It slowed the story down a bit and added to more unnecessary runtime. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were good but weakly developed.

Joss Whedon returns to the directing chair and does a bang-up job of helming the sequel to one of the biggest summer blockbusters of all time. Our favorite Marvel superheroes (including some great new additions) are back and better than ever in what becomes their most arduous battle yet. They are confronted with the malevolent Ultron (James Spader) who began from within the group and, because of his unique inception, begins to tear the group apart at the seams. Constant mind-boggling action, great character moments, and some choice comedic situations help to set this film apart from other generic superhero films. Age of Ultron is one superhero film, flaws and all, that is here to stay. Age of Ultron represents escapist summer blockbuster cinema at its finest and I ate up almost everything about it. The ensemble cast played off of each other excellently and their performances increased my affinity for each individual character. Marvel finally has another formidable villain on their hands in Ultron who is a layered and surprisingly comedic villain. The negative side to his character, and one of my main problems with the film, is that his motives were unclear and forced. his hatred towards the Avengers was not earned. It felt shoe-horned into the script. The greatest sins this film committed though include its uneven pacing and convoluted plot. Maybe this is my spoiled, novelty-craving self saying this but, I thought the first Avengers was a more balanced and, ultimately, better film. There is still lots of fun to be had with Age of Ultron as it is a close 2nd. It must be seen on the biggest screen possible. Marvel films are the best at combining fantastical action with true heart and Age of Ultron continues this signature characteristic. Avengers AOU is a rousing, albeit flawed, summer blockbuster that took me on an emotional roller-coaster I thoroughly wanted to remain on long after the curtain call! I give AOU a #8/10",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

Instead they should have bring Galactus,Thanos or something out of space villain,this robot thing is beyond able to watch again.Director should not have made this movie,i will never watch AOU again,my recommendation was not liked by my few friends who said this are same Hollywood boring style movies,why.

","Not only does Avengers: Age of Ultron succeed at being a great follow up to its predecessor, it also manages to improve on the original. Avengers: Age of Ultron is deeper and darker than Marvel's The Avengers, giving more humanity to the main characters while also lacking boredom. This sequel manages to be faster and more evenly distributed than the original in terms of tone. In the first movie, the first half is pure dialog and the second half is just pure action, making the first 45 minutes feel kind of stale. In Age of Ultron, the dialog and action are more consistent throughout, making it more entertaining. Althoguh the motivation and arc of this movie's villain feels rushed, he is still a ton of fun to watch James Spader completely own the role as the evil Ultron. This movie takes the weakest character from the first Avengers film and gives him a heartwarming backstory and makes him one of the film's best characters.

","There are a number of negative stances that one could take against The Avengers: Age of Ultron. You could argue that the film is repetitive and derivative, given that the Marvel factory has been reliably pumping out both tonally and visually similar films for the last half-decade. Any uniqueness that director Joss Whedon brought to the first Avengers installment feels comfortingly familiar rather than fresh and exciting. In particular, the action sequences have a been there, done that vibe to them. Rather than fighting endless waves of anonymous aliens, the Avengers now battle against endless waves of anonymous robots.

The content, which made me nervous and excited all the movie time, was really brilliant. The whole film was divided into several climaxes and the most exciting part, in my opinion, was the ""island in the sky"". Although it was the one of the exciting films I have ever seen, there was still something needed improving. The film was not so coherent as the last one I saw, all I remembered was groups of people fighting with each other. Besides, I thought the BOSS, Ultron, was so vulnerable in my view, but it still took them a very long time to take him down.

","The only thing I can I think of that's funny for the review of the grand opener of the grand sequel of a grand movie series is Chris Evans, which is ironic because he was literally the worst part of this movie (for being painfully un-funny) other than Ultron. This movie, for all intensive purposes, was better than the first. To put it simply, the first movie basically said ""look at all this neat stuff we can do with CGI and all the plot holes, lopsided character development and underdeveloped back story we can fill in with said CGI. The Avengers is always worth seeing, I ""enjoyed"" the first one and the second more so. Thor, our favorite demi-god is the best character. Seeing his face of pure shock when the Cap budged his iconic hammer was priceless. Ultron; bad villain, Vision; pretty neat, Captain Patriotism; meh, Irod Bad; entertaining, Black Widow; good and I wouldn't kick her out of bed for eating crackers, Green Arrow or Hawkeye or Link or whatever; I don't want your pathos or your gosh-forsaken back story, but you did make fun of yourself, Scarlett Witch; I like you, largely unexplored power and background, show her boobs every 196 frames, make a movie on her with Johnny Depp and Helene Carter-John Bonham whatever and directed by Tim Burton! YAY! Quicksilver; disposable because he was too invincible at the start, not very interesting, but I rather have seen Eagle-eye die to develop his character and possible another Marvel movie. Did I miss anyone? I'm almost over my time limit for writing this review. The movie itself, darker, scaled back a bit and less of the heli-carrier. Much needed development via the Scarlett Witch's power, which was pretty neat. Do more of that. What movie goer doesn't love seeing the subconscious of a boring character in a somewhat ""Sharingan"" from Naruto like mental power. Ultron! Love your voice! You sound like Max Headroom (look him up!) but your ideal went from cool to screw his garbage, kill everyone. No more running jokes, better villain (get like Benedict Cumberbatch or someone of use) and better characters. The Beyonder? Please?

","I am in love with the series, they are just getting cooler and cooler. Story line Movie starts with an on-going battle in all fictional country Sokovia, Strucker has kept Loki's Sceptor from the part1. The team fetches the scepter and Tony discovers the Gem in the Scepter is a complicated Artificial Intelligence which he now intends to use it for his Global peace keeping program named 'Ultron'. As we expect the program goes wrong the Ultron now controls everything on the internet. Ultron misunderstands the objective of peace-keeping and talks about extinction of Avengers and the entire earth for a new evolution. Meanwhile he recruits a twin who were experimented by Strucker, One is a fast moving with a Russian accent, the lady twin is a manipulator of minds and fire boomer. They have a childhood revenge on Stark, their story is heart touching. The Ultron with the help of a scientist builds an indestructible human form weapon which is meant to erase the mighty heroes. Luckily the team stops that and steals the weapon box or whatever its called. Tony gets a second chance to fix his program puts our favorite Jarvis into human form..That was really nice.. A human form with all the powers put together named as Vision comes out as takes side of Avengers against the Ultron. Maximoff twins too join the league. Now the whole crew battle the well spoken Ultron to save the earth. Movie is a mixture of artificial intelligence and Emotions.. When the mind-gamer girl takes everyone for a dream ride there are a lot of complicated scenes which we sorta fail to understand but Whedon has tried his best to put a lot of things together in short-time. Cast - Jeremy Reaner has got a lot of screen presence than anyone else..i guess he was disappointed for his screen time in his last edition. Scarlett (black widow) and the Banner (hulk) have some silent romance, that was unexpected but good move. Mark Ruffalo - Hulk as always larger than life, will talk more about this fight with Tony Chris Evans - Brilliant as Capt. America as always...the hot-star of fantastic four has mastered the art of Superhero Chris Hems - Thor - I din like him much in the first part, he has gone better much cooler in this and the hammer is a lovely weapon to watch. R. Downey Jr - best of all - He steals the show in every screen presence.. Any trend you talk about starts from Tony..!! Veronica.. Hulk-buster.. Jarvis brain.. A lot more..There is no Avengers without the Iron man. Paul Bettany - The actor from the priest ..the voice of Jarvis which we have loved for years.. Comes alive as Vision the new superhero.. Happy to see him.. He justifies the role. Ultron - Voice of John spader - the villain who rips of everyone is one new badass I liked.. Still smaug & joker are my favorite villains.. The voice is malevolently epic. Technology Where there is Tony Stark there is new technology... Veronica is the killer one in this episode.. Veronica is a Armour set which Tony is kept in space...which has a special suit.. Hulk-buster.. OMFG that was crazy...as the name says its made to kick Hulks ass if in case he goes mad. The artificial intelligence.. Though its quite aged.. Wasn't picturized before like the one in this movie.. The beauty of Vfx. The vibranium - The indestructible metal with which the shield of Capt. A Is been made. I love the names of these fictitious metals... Adamantium in xmen n Vibranium here..impressive. Critic The movie sometimes leaves you puzzled, asks you to connect the dots by yourself. By the time you connect the scenes it rushes to the next...one mark less for this. The climax is pretty sober ..doesn't keep you nail-biting... lifting the city up in the air above the clouds to use it as a meteor and drop it down.. Umm not so cool idea.. One mark less for this. Too many heroes vs one Ultron -- not so fair match.. Counting 5+3 heroes ..will get everyone less screen time please Hollywood don't repeat the same mistake. Some incredible stuff Hulk-buster & The Hulk fight -- paisa wasool part of the movie Humor on victory party.. and try lifting Thor's Hammer was very tickling. Quicksilver in slow motion ..the speedsters action shown in slow motion in a beautiful way. Atlast the fight with thousands of minion like robots with The avengers altogether at one place. Its a treat to watch all the powers come together. Good to see a complete performance by everyone but not by the director in-terms of narration. Post credits a new villain is shown as a Hint of next sequel who is probably bigger than hulk and he has a ironman handsuit which fires. Says.. Fine I ll do it myself. Lets watch for the next.

For me, this is a perfect sequel, just like Terminator 2 was. Im not saying that Age of Ultron is as good as Terminator 2, but it surely is worth watching. The movie ads 2 ""new"" characters to the Avengers Universe. They call them ""enchanced"", but they are really mutants from the x- men universe. I don't really like them, and I think that they are the biggest flaw in the movie. All of the characters in the movie have its own back story, which are surprisingly deep. The movie last for two hours and 20 minutes, and in its runtime it packs a tone of action, some twists and turns, epic moments, emotions, character development and many other things. It improves over its predecessor in every single way. Also, I would like to say that cinematography in this movie is perfect.

There were emotional parts, action packed elements and just like in the first film some excellent comedy. I adored the character of Ultron- he was evil and cunning. There are certain scenes that if you are a marvel fan, they will make you want to scream out in the cinema from amazement- the ending (the very end is just such an amazing moment) and the fight between hulk and iron man are some of these scenes- among others. The relationship between the avengers is explored so much more in this film and only adds to the film- their comedy bounces off one another and they really work and stick as team despite everything that comes to light in this film.

","Avengers: Age of Ultron was not a bad movie overall but there were disadvantages and advantages that I either liked about the movie or just did not like. Before reading more there are spoilers, so be cautious... The advantages that I enjoyed about this movie is that it defiantly started off good to me, it had good action and everything came together well. I rather much enjoyed watching scarlet witch and quicksilver. I also LOVED the fight between Hulk and iron man in the hulk hater suit, while watching it I did not want it to end... Adding the vision character in the MCU was interesting and cool to see, and I think the ending was awesome, but I really wanted it to be a lot longer because I enjoyed it so much. These are basically the parts in the movie that I liked. Some negatives things I hated about the movie was they did not explain how iron man got back into the avengers or even get all his suits back after iron man 3, there was a huge part in the movie that was extremely slow and boring and some of it was just dragged out. I feel like Ultron wasn't really that strong or did not really do much in the movie, they killed him so easily he didn't really fight or do much of anything other than looking cool. Last thing I did not like about this movie is they ended the fight between hulk and iron man in the hulk buster suit to fast, it just like ended by iron man knocking out the hulk, they could have easily put on at least 5 more minutes, but these are my likes and dislike for Avengers: Age of Ultron.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

Obviously contains its usual Marvel humor. Im going to see this a couple more times while in theater. I hate to admit it but I liked it more than the first Avengers.

","The sequel to 2012's breakout superhero hit, Age of Ultron obviously serves as a middle film in the MCU. Although the stakes are significantly higher than last time, some aspects feel a little underwhelming and inconsequential, despite the total or partial destruction of at least three major cities. Joss Whedon still proves adept at staging massive action sequences and giving his characters endless quips to throw at each other at even the worst of times, but taking into account that he has discussed several times that the making of the film exhausted him, it's occasionally noticeable, as he includes, by necessity from the powers that be in the MCU, many character cameos and hints of future plots.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

","Every movie Marvel had put it had been just one tough act to follow again and again, but somehow they always out do themselves! Downey Jr., Hemsworth, Ruffalo, Evans, Renner, Johannson are all back for the new installment. It's their great reunited team since 2012's ""The Avengers"". What makes this different from that first ""Avengers"" movie is that when we open up in this one with a bad ass scene is that everyone's strengths and abilities are helpful towards one another. They are an actual team that can work together and fight together. You truly get to see what makes each and every one of them a kick ass superhero! That's right, even Jeremy Renners Hawkeye! Marvel finally gave him some screen time and actual great stuff to do here. As far as other stars we got Aaron Taylor- Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen playing as Maximof twins, trained to be henchmen of Hydra but eventually become under Ultron wing, played by the amazing James Spader. Once James Spader's Ultron starts causing havoc, it's not only The Avengers strongest physical threat, but mentally. Adding the Maximof towns to this story was great because with their powers and wit, they manage to really make The Avengers face and think of their worst fears. Hallucinations and mind control and super speed, that's a hell of a henchmen team. There's a point in the movie when The Avengers have to hideout and not be on Ultrons radar, and for me that scene is when things were kicking off. There's a ton of drama in there and conflicts and still plenty of surprises about The Avengers talk about why they do what they do, and maybe some stuff in there which some of them take a negative feeling to what powers they have or not able to feel completed in life. What I've been hearing a ton lately is that the movie is too jokey in some parts, often too destructive, and just flat out too loud. I'm just gonna say some things to make up for what people have said. Is it jokey? - Why yes of course it is you can have humor so you can balance out the dark stuff that may be in there. Is it too destructive?- The threat is bigger so you'd understand why the spectacle is there, but it never goes the ""Transformers"" route where there is just unnecessary damage and death everywhere. A lot of fans walked into this film with the expectation from its very sad dopey trailer that this was gonna be like ""The Dark Knight"" almost. Is it ""The Dark Knight""? No it shouldn't have to be, it's got everything in place to be where it can be a little dark and fun. It's really not like totally for kids. All the emotional and tense stuff is balanced just right and this what I expected it to be! Also when a scene is tense, it's really tense! You can't always walk into a movie expecting it to be just exactly like the trailer, well on some conditions Maybe you can but overall just go on there with an open mind and enjoy yourself, I don't see how you couldn't, like Ultron says, ""Oh for Gods sake!"" It's ""The Avengers""! It's a punch a minute, a laugh a minute, ugh it's what you want for an ""Avengers"" flick! It's what I mentioned at the beginning, Marvel outdoing their selfs with every film. And yes, Marvel's ""Avengers:Age Of Ultron"" is so far they're best adventure to date, unless July's ""Ant-Man"" can knock it off the top rank. What's funny about that comparison is that I'm serious, it could, Marvel is just THAT good.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

1316,26 April 2015,eylambartal,9," Age of the first true ""Avengers"" villain
","The first thought that popped into my head when I left the theater was: ""I've got to watch this movie again"". This film, much like its predecessor, serves as a junction for the paths paved in all previous Marvel films- therefore, the great detail and simultaneous procedures on screen reach a ""Game of Thrones"" -esc crumminess but, it works! The amazing thing in my opinion, is each character's presence felt just prominent enough in this feature. Iron Man- Tony Stark is back big time with his endless sense of humor, as friction between him and his fellow Avengers reach a critical point in ""Age of Ultron"". Although his most interesting relationship by far in this film is with the titular main villain. Captain America- feels like the WWII super soldier has outgrown his cardboard superhero roots and delves further into his interesting and reflective sides, already seen in ""Captain America: the winter soldier"". Thor- Personably, I love him! but it is notable that alongside his friends he looks like a last minute reinforcement, both action and story-wise. Yet he does manage to give this film its strongest emphasis of being a part of a well developed universe with to come. Hulk- As a hero who got just one solo film portrayal in the shared universe so far, Age of Ultron gives Bruce Banner and his monstrous alter ego, a well deserved emphasis over his more well established buddies. His Character also corresponds well with the movie's main theme of losing control over one's creations. Black widow- Super-spy Natasha Romanoff, Despite lacking any solo film yet (and maybe because) seems to own this film a little more. It explores her dark origins as the team's ""other monster"", hence creating an intriguing and promising bond between her and The Hulk, with The good old Hulk's 90's animated show feel to it. Hawkeye- Also in lack of a solo feature, fills the role of the only ""normal"" Avenger, but rather as a fact that makes him both interesting and unique among his monstrous and neurotic teammates. A few more familiar faces come back from past films such as Agent Maria Hill, War Machine, Falcon, Baron Von Strucker and Nick Fury- most of them get just enough good screen performance to leave you wanting more. Also, ""The Vision"", a newcomer, gets a small but significant role and it is undoubtedly a pleasure to see Paul Bettany displaying his full acting abilities for once in the Marvel films. The twins Wanda and Pietro Maximoff- the new dominant super powered pair, I take care not to call them ""Heroes"" since during much of the film they are loyal only to themselves rather than side with good or evil. It is quite intriguing to witness characters which go against the common super hero genre dichotomy. Wanda and her mysteriously unpredictable powers, is more interesting than her super fast brother Pietro, who is a pale version compared to his wonderful portrayal in last year's ""X-men: Days of Future Past"". And the best is saved for last, Ultron- in a single sentence ""He's like a classic James Bond villain who watched all the previous Bond films"" (""I'd like to take this time to elaborate my evil plan"" *stops speaking, starts blasting*) that rogue A.I. is masterfully portrayed by James Spader. Ultron is a villain that fits the Avengers like a puzzle piece, Challenging each one of them at their own fields of play. I always liked how he tries to constantly display his differentiation and superiority over human beings in the comics, only to prove how strongly the human DNA of his creators stuck in him. That theme is up-played in the film, for the first time Ultron is portrayed with fully expression able face, his voice, despite a light metallic echo, his voice is humanly warm and emotional and his black sense of humor serves as a (rightful) competitor to Iron Man's. The filmmakers set themselves a goal with Ultron, to engage Marvel's cinematic universe's lack of charismatic and memorable villains. Ultron faithfully reaches that goal and I personally hope his villainous successors down the line would manage to fill the very large shoes left by the dreaded droid (Lookin' at you Thanos!). My sole complaint of Ultron is that Spader didn't manage to give him enough separate identity from his famous portrayal of the smart and slick crook Red Reddington from ""The Blacklist"".

But this is what you get when the avengers is more about saving the world, and other movies are more story based. Makes you wonder more about the behind the scenes. Ultron was invigorating funny.

The movie was awesome, the Avengers were more focused as a team rather than individuals, and they have been developed from their last appearance with more interaction between characters and more action in fight scenes. The villain was perfect, Ultron posed a deadly threat which in his viewpoint was simply a mission he must enact. This directly adopts Ultron's persona from the comics which was also such a malevolent character. The story felt unorthodox but great seeing as this is a team-up movie and not a solo film. It was really awesome to see that Ultron had this weird idea that he was right and his plan, ultimately, was a huge surprise to both fans and moviegoers. The actors and actresses did their job well. In addition, Elizabeth Olsen's character was good but Aaron's Quicksilver needed more screen time, Hawkeye was done some justice by appearing as a mentor to Olsen's character.

","I want to start off by asking this of everyone who thinks the first movie was superior: can you name one thing that Age of Ultron didn't improve on? Now this is certainly just one man's opinion, but I felt Whedon proved his ability once again to handle nearly a dozen superheroes on the screen together with ease. The fight sequences were thrilling and they showed us more of the Avengers working together despite their differences in methods and ideals. I laughed much more than I had anticipated (""Iron Man: Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep"") and the moments of calm provided not only comic relief but some elements of well executed and genuine emotion. In fact, Hawkeye steals the show in multiple scenes, which was satisfying to watch after he was under-used in the first film. Of course, Age of Ultron is by no means flawless but so rarely does a movie come this close to perfection. I was slightly underwhelmed by the main villain Ultron who, while charismatic, never came across as being especially menacing. But this can be overlooked as all the heroes bring their collectively impressive acting talent and charm to every single scene. Even the brief mid-credits scene left me in awe because it reveals what is in store for the next two Avengers movies and what is in store for the future looks very exciting.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

I never would have thought iron man could beat hulk. Avengers made the same mistake as iron man 3 with having too much comedy in the movie. The comedy had its moments but overall killed the movies's tone. Future marvel movies need to be darker like DC movies and the winter soldier. Ultron was the biggest screw up of the movie. Ultron was less threatening than the winter soldier of all villains(props to the Russo brothers). Whedon made the Vision too powerful, for he could have beaten Ultron himself. One new bright spot was quicksilver. I enjoyed every scene he was in. It is to bad they had to kill him off. Thor is the most powerful member of the team, and he should have got more screen time than he did. Joss Whedon picked a little more than he could chew on this motion picture.

","The Avengers 2: Age of Ultron Review: I was so amazed about why this film really existed in cinemas worldwide. Quite frankly I did not even know why it really needed to. It's just not only one of the best MCU films ever,but also one of the best films of 2015. And yet i believed that it was a lot better than The Avengers 1 which is one of the highest-grossing films of 2012. So how awesome can this film really be? Let's find out. Story:I have been so proud of Joss Whedon for all of the movie he wrote. The plot is so amazing. Yes folks i'm totally dead serious about that. The story wasn't so big without it's own dark and menacing tone. I mean come on, how could you definitely love that kind of tone? In addition, my goodness the screenplay looks so fantastic. So in conclusion all of the story is spectacular. Characters: every single character in the flick is truly unforgettable to watch. And Ultron is one of the best villains in all of movie history. You guys better or better not get in his way. Also Wanda and her brother are twins with superpowers? That is pretty awesome in my book. And would look who got the most screen time in the movie? Captain America you played well for now. All the characters from the film are so very well-acted and trust me when I say that they're all well worth watching. Music: My freaking god. All the music from the flick is so incredible to hear and listen to. And I am for one giving a big kudos to Brian Tyler and Danny Elfman for it. It is also good having Alan Silvestri's themes back for the very first time in a row. I'm more than happy about that. Visaul Effects: All the Special Effects and Visaul Effects are brilliant. And there is absolutely no question about that. The design of the Ultron Sentanls is so cool that I can not ever bear it.

","I was very concerned after reading some of the negative reviews. After finally seeing the flick after a late release overseas, I don't think the movie could've been much better for my expectations, though I do understand why some viewers don't quite agree. No movie can cater to everyone's taste. It just depends on what you're trying to get out of it and what you're expecting. If you're looking for some concoction of profundity or depth, this is simply not the right genre. If you think it lacks character building, my opinion is that you've gotta be realistic with respect to the number of characters and the limited film duration. There had also been plenty of opportunities in the previous standalone films for character building. The film did move at a frenetic pace, requiring a fairly comprehensive spectrum of knowledge and familiarity with the MCU in order to keep up as well as to fully comprehend and appreciate all the seemingly minute but essential details, which, if connected together effectively, would've made the experience much more rewarding.

","Being an incredibly passionate Marvel Universe fan, I went into Avengers: Age of Ultron with expectations extremely high; the first film was near perfect in my opinion, so I was ecstatic to see what Whedon would have in store for the second. The very first thing that stuck out to me was the stunning fight choreography-they really stepped up their game in this one and added a lot of incredible team moves. There is a moment when all of the Avengers (+ Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver) are standing in a circle protecting the core, and the camera moves around each of them in slow motion as they are fighting, creating the most breathtaking and exciting scene in the entire movie. The characters in this film are more angry, conflicted, and complex. Scarlet Witch shows each Avenger their greatest fear, and the results are chilling. We see Black Widow's haunting past as well as a little bit of Captain America's PTSD-both add emotion and depth to the characters. Despite a cheesy, eye-roll worthy love-interest plot between Banner and Romanov, I enjoyed seeing the characters' hearts ripped out a little bit. Despite the vast changes from the comics as far as Ultron and Vision's origins, the movie was compelling, exciting, and stunning. James Spader's Ultron was flawless and chilling-easily my favorite part.

","==The Avengers: Age of Ultron== This movie is directed by Joss Whedon.It is bigger and better than it's prequel 'Avengers'. Sure it repeat a lot of same formulas of the first film, but to different effects on a very different narrative. In the first Avengers movie we had the Thor vs.Hulk fight sequence. In this movie we were given the Ironman vs. Hulk.The action sequences are amazing,especially the opening scene with the Avengers leaping off trucks and destroying everything in their path.The movie is a tedious one though, as it is slow and tiring but still it is worth watching this movie. Ultron is bad-ass villain in the movie.He was forged with the strongest steel in the world, carries an infinity stone, and his best power is his cape-shape-ability.Ultron is created by Tony stark and Dr. Banner using Loki's stick as a peacekeeping program. But this invention went wrong and Ultron tries to destroy humanity.Thus,The movie revolves around the efforts and struggle of Avengers to control Ultron. Avengers make the business of being a hero look in the film's opening scenes, the movie is ultimately about the hard work needed to do what's right in a world that doesn't make that any easier, for the extraordinary and the ordinary alike.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

","first of all, I have to admit that even after watching the first avenger movie, I wasn't yet, fully convinced with the incredible talent of joss whedon...which is very unfortunate; considering how surprised I am walking out of the age of ultron experience; he was able to create a wonderful chemistry between this very different characters and give them very efficient arguments and vision about what's the right thing to do , it felt almost like a great drama film with awesome and well executed action sequences, as well as the constantly good performances by everyone, especially RDJ.... it's worth mentioning that the villain -ultron- was kind of likable with his well delivered quotes and his thoughts about the evolution of mankind, even though he hadn't that much stuffs to do especially at the end of the movie. besides,other characters were introduced in this movie, and ""vision' was without a doubt the one who stole it; through his great debut speech and his marvelous appearance. However, I wasn't that much invested in the two others,especially quicksilver who I think was more of weak point in the movie,in addition to some little plot holes like the first appearance of nick fury and the way the avengers have defeated ultron ... overall, I think that this movie is the perfect continuation of the MCU, and an amazing mixture of fun,humour with some solid action and great characters development.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

It was also stated by Joss 09 hedonistic multiple times that there was footage that didn't make the final cut as it would've made for a movie longer than the hobbit, making it feel a face paced movie. I get this and think that it is a great set up for the coming Marvel movies, and may set up Antman and clearly sets up Black Panther, as the Klaw was created by ultron (not by intention) and the city/country of Wakkanda. It also sets up our infinity war story as it describes the infinity stones, and features the Infinity Gauntlet. It also begins our plot of the Civil War to come, as well as expanding our universe of characters, such as Winter Soldier references, War Machine Mark II and even Falcons new suit. The only thing I find a problem is Quicksilver's death, as it was his opening film. Other than that it is a great movie and recommend it to anyone who enjoys action with a dash of comedy, just as any other Marvel Movie.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

While this movie may have similarities to the first movie that some are complaining about there is also a lot that changed also. The saying that goes something like ""If it isn't broken, don't fix it"" can apply to some parts of this movie which is a good thing. To the people are saying that its the same ol' type of action movie and are disappointed, I think you are looking too deep into and expect too much. Not every sequel has to be completely different then the first movie of any series. I feel that people are also giving it bad reviews because they are the close minded type who always think the first of any series is the best and no sequel is better.

","WHAT I LIKED: A movie of such size that still has soul. 'Age of Ultron' truly is massive, an ambitious round of great, explosive action, special effects, setup and an incredible (and massive) cast. But Whedon manages to pull all that together in a way that the movie still feels personal. This is thanks to his level of characterisation and relationship development which bring some realism to the overall spectacle, giving the audience excitement, awe and buckets emotions throughout. In fact, by far the best scenes here are where the Avengers just talk, grounding everything ready for more incredible action. And because of this roller coaster ride, 'Avengers 2' has to be the MCU's best film to date. Nothing like it brings together everything great about all the films and comics we love like this does. Well done Whedon. WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Perhaps the reason for this film's overall average reception is the marketing campaign, which built expectations for an entirely different film. Without that, 'Age of Ultron' only really falters with small things. In a film this ambitious, there are bound to be niggles (Thor's cave etc.) But the beauty of it is that they hardly take away from the overall experience at all. VERDICT: The MCU's best film is a thrilling, beautiful roller coaster. Whedon steers it with perfection - and achieves a blockbuster with real soul.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

","It sounds like most of the people who reviewed this movie didn't care much for it. I don't know if I'm abnormally easy to please (I certainly don't think so) but I loved this movie. I thought it was fantastic. I thought the humor that was present throughout the movie was true to the characters and added some personality to what could have been a very dark & dreary movie. I thought that there were some great small moments of character development (let's be honest, we can't be expecting every one of the dozen main characters on screen to undergo a dramatic personal growth in this type of ensemble effort) and there is just enough of a story (not a complicated one) to bring the impressive action sequences together nicely. In fact I think one of the strengths of the movie was the character interactions/dialog. I'm admittedly a fan of the way Joss does that in just about all of his projects (I know some are not) but the little hints (some subtle, some not) & moments of reading in between the lines does a lot more character development than some want to give credit for. If I were to judge by the theater's reaction, everyone seemed to come out of auditorium thoroughly impressed. There was laughter, gasps, oohs and ahhs all throughout the movie I'm sure there are some folks who genuinely didn't like parts of this movie, but it seems that at least some of these bad reviews are coming from kids who are just too cool for school. I thought Joss did a great job and that in many ways Age of Ultron was the equal to and in some moments surpassed the first movie. I had read some of the reviews before seeing the film and was resigning myself to maybe being disappointed or the movie not living up to my own expectations. I ended up loving every second of it. I felt like a kid in a candy shop for 2.5 hours and couldn't find a bad thing to say. I guess everyone has a different take on it, had different expectations for what sort of movie it would be or what the characters would be doing... but I for one, couldn't recommend this movie any higher.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015

Even maybe Professor X can't affect him. In some point with the fight with Hulkbuster, he gets kind of exhausted. This was very wrong. Hulk can fight for weeks without stopping and he gets stronger with that. If he gets strong enough, he can destroy Hulkbuster with a single punch. 3- Quicksilver isn't that slow.

I have read 5 pages of ratings to see if maybe it's just me that doesn't like it, but the first 5 pages are nearly all 1 and 2 star ratings. I don't get it.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015
1416,4 June 2015,bloodysatana666,9," About Loki and scarlet Witch
","I am really disappointed that Loki wasn't in it. It was all about Loki's scepter and he wasn't even in it. They had to give Loki a little role just one scene or more, but they didn't. I am also surprised that Scarlet Witch is the twin sister of Quicksilver. In the Comics I read Quicksilver was the son of Scarlet Witch. I also know other theories about Scarlet Witch. One theory is that Scarlet Witch got a son with Wolverine, the child have Wolverine powers. Other theory is that Scarlet Witch is the daughter of Magneto. After she lost her children she is mental damaged and she destroyed the Avengers. One other weird theory is that scarlet witch is the daughter of Magneto and sister of Quicksilver (like in the movies). Well I hope this review is useful.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015
1417,3 May 2015,kc-49817,8," Great fun with a few glaring flaws
","Firstly, Age of Ultron is a good movie. I'm going to pick apart a few mingling annoyances. But these are still minor gripes, and ultimately, this is the most fun I've had in a theater since Guardians of the Galaxy. I did not leave the theater thinking I'd wasted time and money, I left enthusiastically chatting with my viewing companions about what would happen next.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015
1418,2 May 2015,meganparkin-53508,8," Avengers: Age of Ultron is a great film that is just missing half an hour from the beginning...
","Avengers: Age of Ultron is a great film that is just missing half an hour from the beginning. The action scenes were, as always, brilliant, the dialogue was hilarious and there really were some emotional scenes in this film. However I feel that some of the story lines were either rushed or came out of nowhere. One of the main ones was the hulk/black widow romance. Now don't get me wrong I actually quite like this couple but we went from them having a pretty normal (or as normal as can be with the avengers) relationship to them pretty much being a full on couple, there was no in between. Also the hydra base at the beginning was a bit unexplained. My other issue with this film was Ultron. Based on the trailers I expected a really dark, different villain, but instead Ultron was funny and more human than I expected for a robot, even though he is based off Tony Stark. This is actually a really funny film, I was laughing out loud at several points in the cinema, Hawkeye, especially is brilliant and is now one of my favourite avengers but Ultron having humorous dialogue felt like a little too much, he should have been darker to balance out the humour of the avengers themselves. I also felt like the film makers rushed into his whole 'I'm going to murder humanity' mind set as he is basically created and 5 minutes later ready to cause global extinction. Despite these criticisms I really enjoyed this film and Joss Whedon does not fail to keep the audience engaged. Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver make great additions to the team, Vision is awesome and we get to see more of what motivates the avengers than ever before. Overall I think Marvell did a good job but we could have done with seeing a bit more which is again, probably a good thing!",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015
1419,20 September 2015,fpatmirth,1," All Germans are evil Nazis
",Really? The same old story of all Germans being evil Nazis? I think the people making these films need to take a closer look at the demographics of the American population and reconsider the same old story of hatred for the Germans over a war that war was 75 years ago. I'm part Jewish and am still getting sick of Hollywood spinning hatred about something they can't get over instead of sending a message of unity and humanity trying to get along with each other going forward. Using Hollywood to try and brainwash people into enough hatred to start another war just isn't going to happen. This has gotten ridiculous. I'm sick of the hate. Get over it.,/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015
1420,1 May 2015,djkg1,9," The most spectacular movie I've ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","I was a little worried when I saw that this movie only got 75% on Rotten Tomatoes.com. So I paid $11.25 today at 1:00 for 3D with guarded expectations. I was literally on the edge of my seat for 80% of the movie. It was everything I wanted it to be and exceeded my expectations by far. I simply don't understand how a fan of Marvin movies could walk away disappointed with this film. I'm going back to see it again to get clear of some things that I didn't quite get the first time, especially the mind blowing technology in the infinity stones.Sometimes when a movie like this adds so many characters, things get very confusing and jumbled.But this director made it all come together perfectly and every character makes sense and has purpose.

","it was like Guardians of the Galaxy i was smiling the during the film and i couldn't stop it Ultron was the perfect villain in the movie, He was funny/Angry When T.Stark en Hulk was fighting each other some parts were funny the special effect was mind blowing if you watch the movie you could feel that Civil War was coming i still don't understand why Quicksilver had to die, it was so sad. Hawkeye was perfect in the movie, he was perfect guy to lead Scarlet Witch. Black Widow and hulk? oh my god perfect, when i saw The Avengers i was like Black Widow and Hulk? yeah why not? black widow is the key for hulk to become normal again.

1422,22 May 2015,michaelwebby,8," Impressive Sequel
","A really impressive squeal! Without any shadow of a doubt this movie goes in my top 15 favourite movies of all time. I have never been a big marvel fan but I have watched the Iron Man movies, the Thor movies, the Captain America movies and the original Avenger's movie which I thought were all very good. I do tend to dislike squeals of excellent films because as we all know sequels of great films tend to never cut the mustard. one of the best examples of this would be The 3 squeals to the original pirates of the Caribbean movie, they have all be dreadful compared to the original however I am happy to report that Age of Ultron does not fit this pattern, it's a film with unparallelled action scenes and some outstanding acting performances. The story is a bit complicated if you don't know a lot about marvel but with a 5 minute explanation from a marvel geek and you will have no probs understanding the story. The theme itself centres on what can happen if we let artificial intelligence to its own devices, other themes include love, family bond, regrets and power.

","This is a great film, I've seen it twice and cannot understand the hate, maybe people expect to much from a film about superheroes in a comic? Sure its a bit similar to the first, but what do you expect its about a team of heroes trying to stop world destruction, heck even the upcoming infinity war movies will be similar in this fact except the Avengers will be saving the universe not just earth.",/review/rw3238460/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_2015
