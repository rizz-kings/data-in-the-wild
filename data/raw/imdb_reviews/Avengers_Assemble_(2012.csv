0,21 August 2021,SPZMaxinema,10," Can't beat the originality of uniting a superhero team! Aside from Avengers 3 and Spider-Man 2, best superhero movie ever made!
","This might be controversial to say but this is my personal favorite MCU movie. Up until this point, nothing had been done like this in film and it was executed magnificently. Going into this movie in 2012 (having only seen Iron Man beforehand) I was skeptical and not interested. Then my brother took us to the theater to see it and it was one hell of a blast. I was blown away and wanted to watch all of the other Phase 1 movies and learn more about these other heroes. The casting and chemistry between them is on point, the villain is compelling and gets under your skin in the best way, and Robert Downey Jr.'s humor all around is unforgettable, and how can I not mention that glorifying theme song?? Not to mention Stan Lee's perfect cameo!",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012
1,24 June 2021,aidanratesmovies,9," The Avengers Assemble for the First Time
","It's a film that future generations will still be gushing about, much like previous generations did with such classics as Star Wars and Indiana Jones. It may not be perfect, but The Avengers lives up to its promise and delivers quite a punch. I feel The Avenger struggles as most superhero movies do with finding a way to naturally introduce its characters in a way that doesn't seem forced or formulaic. They do a decent job for what it is, but there are certain times you will feel the campiness of older works coming on as you view the film, and truly you just have to sit through it to get to the action that eventually will be at hand. Besides that though, there isn't many flaws. The acting is rather good, Samuel L. Jackson may take a line too seriously or too, but it's all in good fun. Again Tom Hiddleston as Loki is a major standout, and I also enjoyed the return of Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man and Chris Hemsworth Thor- as well as an improved performance by Chris Evans as Captain America and a great performance from replacement Hulk actor Mark Ruffalo. The action scenes are exciting and tense, there is some camera angles here and there that can be a bit annoying, but for the most part it is rather clear and not awfully tedious action- as many films of this type could be. In the end, despite its campiness and formulaic actions- The Avengers is an incredibly fun time. It takes pride in its stories and characters and makes the most out of an experience that could have easily been phoned in. Its a film that will live on for some time, and one i'm rather glad I got to experience first hand.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012
2,2 July 2017,ivo-cobra8,10," Bad-ass descent-amazing superhero MCU action flick defenders of the earth my favorite
","Marvel's The Avengers (2012) is an awesome descent MCU superhero action flick that is spectacular and a real good one. The first time I watched it on my computer I loved it. I have seen this movie many times in the row I have this film on DVD and Blu-ray. The movie features an ensemble cast that includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders, Stellan Skarsgård, and Samuel L. Jackson. Joss Whedon did a fine job directing the film and I loved it is definitely in my top 10 favorite MCU superhero films. In the finale battle in New York the moment right there.. WILL NEVER... EVER.. BE AS COOL.. LIKE THIS WAS A COMIC MASTERPIECE.. I don't even read comics, but I did superheroes when I was younger.. I have a feeling justice league will never have this cohesion... this team work.. and will never be able to recreate this feeling.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012
3,10 August 2014,TheLittleSongbird,9," Not 100% perfect but still an outstanding film in so many ways
","Superhero films are always fun to watch when they are done right, and while to some degree it is understandable why people wouldn't be totally enamoured with it(as seen in a lot of the negative comments, a lot of them being condescending though- enough with the ignorant conspiracy theories already!- and some not even worthy of being called reviews) Avengers Assemble for me was an example of a fun and intelligent superhero film that was done right. True, the story is formulaic but not to the extent that was too distracting. In fact my only two complaint was to do with one performances that didn't quite work personally. And that was Jeremy Renner who was rather on the dull side as Hawkeye, whose character development did seem a little rushed and underwritten, that Hawkeye has inner demons is made very clear but it could have come through more strongly. However the rest of the performances were great, a big shout out going to Tom Hiddleston who is serpentine personified as Loki, though Robert Downey Jnr's charismatic Iron Man, Samuel L. Jackson's no-nonsense Nick Fury, Mark Ruffalo's very confident Hulk(he doesn't make you miss Eric Bana or Ed Norton), Chris Hemsworth's dynamic and not wimpy Thor(if he was I put it down to his hidden demons character development) and Chris Evans' modest, heartfelt Captain America were equally great. Scarlett Johansson convinces mostly too, Black Widow's back story is intriguing and Johansson is wonderful when she acts fearless but when in her emotional, imploring moments her acting is rather forced and out of character for Black Widow. For a film with as many characters as seen here, Avengers Assemble still makes a vast majority of them very interesting(only Hawkeye really disappointed), in character and not one-sided and all of them have their turn to shine. It didn't feel to me like a film that tried to cram in too many heroes all at once for the sake of it. The film is very slickly made with astounding special effects and dazzlingly executed stunt-work. Alan Silvestri's score pulsates with power and the action sequences are exciting. The story may be formulaic and standard good-and-evil but is crisply paced and intelligently handled with just the right blend of humour, pathos and action with not one component over-shadowing the others. What was really enjoyable especially was the toe-to-toe with Thor and Iron Man and Hulk. What was really remarkable was the script, filled with thoughtful exposition and snappy banter that stayed true to The Avengers while also with Joss Whedon's own style that was apparent in a lot of his other work. Overall, Avengers Assemble may not be 100% perfect or among the best ever but it is still an outstanding film with a lot to love about it, and no this is not coming from a fake account or a plant, just someone who can be hard to please who genuinely enjoyed it. 9/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","I have got to tell anyone who will listen that this is one of THE best adventure movies I've ever seen. It's almost impossible to convey how pumped I am now that I've seen it. I purposefully avoid hyping myself for movies because when expectations are too high, nothing seems to be able to reach them. I usually avoid the hype train whenever possible. That said, I was jacked to see this movie and was fully aboard the hype train. It couldn't be helped. So, I was certainly open to intense disappointment had this movie not been good.

6,20 April 2012,facebook-124-955845,10," The Avengers assembled flawlessly
","I'm sorry to say The Avengers isn't a good movie; it's a GREAT  MOVIE!!!! It's not only the best team superhero movie ever made, but it  may just be the best comic book adaption made period!  The Avengers is the culmination of what began in Iron Man; and  continued through The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain  America. It was only a few years ago that my son and I had just  finished watching Iron Man and as the credits were ending, Samuel L.  Jackson appeared on screen as Nick Fury and spoke to Tony Stark about  joining Avengers Initiativein that short scene, the framework for  potentially the greatest comic book movie of all-time had begun!   Director Joss Whedon, most known for the T.V. series Buffy The Vampire  Slayer, takes the foundation that was built in the prior films and  brings together the greatest team of superheroes in film history, The  Avengers: Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain  America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk/Bruce  Banner (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye  (Jeremy Renner) as ""assembled"" by Nick Fury. Whedon's scripts usually  include clever banter, gripping action sequences and an air of mystery  and The Avengers is no different. Whedon has an utter love for comic  books, and it is proudly put on display in The Avengers.  The cast does a great job of bringing these iconic characters to life,  beginning with Robert Downey Jr. Unlike Iron Man 2, in which Downey  seemed to skate through scene after scene, Downey plays Stark almost  effortlessly, delivering his lines with relative ease allowing his  charisma, charm and smugness to shine through; Robert Downey Jr. IS  Tony Stark! Chris Evans' solidifies himself in the role of Captain  America. He was very good in his solo film, but truly owns the role  standing alongside Iron Man and Thor. Chris Hemsworth's Asgardian god  Thor has some incredible battle scenes and indirectly provides one of  the film's most funny moments. After being seriously underutilized in  Iron Man 2, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow is provided a back-story,  which helps in developing the character and provides an opportunity to  prove she is much more than just a pretty face; she's as dangerous  psychologically as she is physically. I could envision myself enjoying  a beat-down at the hands (and feet) of Black Widow. The character I was  most concerned about being given little story and the least amount of  screen time was Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye; happily, he's not left by the  wayside and does a more than admirable job of developing the character.  Hawkeye stands alongside Robin Hood and Katniss Everdene (The Hunger  Games) as the best archers to grace the silver screen. I'd like to see  more of him in a film of his own. Mark Ruffalo, the most recent choice  to play Hulk, is far better suited to the role than Eric Bana (The  Hulk) and Ed Norton Jr (The Incredible Hulk). Ruffalo looks more the  part of the nerdy scientist Banner and plays the part without looking  angry in every scene. In The Avengers, the Hulk is at his most  impressive, both in his on-screen transformation and the violence he  displays when the opportunity calls for him to ""hulk out"". If any  character appeared to stand out a little bit more than the others, for  me it was the Hulk. Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury is finally more than  just the guy making surprise appearances. Fury is finally able to  stretch his legs some, and Jackson slides quite easily into the role.  Clark Gregg's Agent Caulson returns, and Cobie Smulders makes her  Marvel films debut as Agent Maria Hill, and she is a welcome addition.  The film's main villain is Thor's adopted-brother Loki, played by Tom  Hiddleston. You would think the part would be a difficult one to play  being opposite such powerful personalities and strong characters, but  Hiddleston does a fantastic job; the performance should not go  unnoticed, because it's one of the strong points of the film. Loki is  not a villain without purpose and Hiddleston comes across as a devious  mastermind without being cartoonish.  At a running-time of 2+ hours, The Avengers is well paced and time  flies by. The effects are top-notch, the acting is very good, and the  script drives the movie elevating its strengths. For viewers that may  not have seen any of the other films (and if so, why not!?!?), we're  provided just enough information to bring everyone up to speed without  feeling overdone. Whedon provides more than just a standard comic book  film, but a story with reason that's backed up with incredible action  and humor.   Although the film is filled with larger than life characters, none are  short changed; each character is given at least one great scene to work  with, and the opportunities don't go to waste. The film's finale  provides a deafening crescendo of action that is breathtaking. As usual  with Marvel films, be sure to stay around for the post credit sequence,  which provides a surprising reveal.  I went into The Avengers with unfairly high expectations, due to all of  those that were involved, as well as the films that came before it.  After viewing the initial trailers and not being blown away, I had set  myself up for disappointment. It was only a matter of minutes after the  film started that I was put at ease, and just minutes later when my  expectations were blown away. I never imagined that it was possible to  put onto the screen, what I was watching. I'm happy that Marvel had the  sense to keep these properties to themselves and to move forward with  these characters in the manner in which they did. Marvel Studios and  Disney are going to make a boatload of money off this film, and  deservedly so; because there's never been another movie made of its  caliber.

","If you're a fan of epic adventure movies, then this is your dream come true. This is the type of film you fantasized about growing up! It really is the ultimate superhero mash-up and it's done perfectly. The makers of this film certainly understand spectacle but they also get the intricacies and depth these type of characters can provide. That right there assures this instant classic will be thought of as the best as well as the biggest film of 2012. The depth of this movie really did surprise me. Even though the high quality of the actors involved and there previous work as these very same characters seemed to indicate otherwise, I was expecting a wild popcorn movie. I was wrong in thinking it was too much to convey in one film. I couldn't be more pleased because they balanced everything masterfully. Sure, there's the popcorn fun we were all expecting but there's also a definite soul to the film and a smart plot as well.

8,12 May 2012,planktonrules,7," The world loves it, though I still think the original ""Iron Man"", ""Thor"" and ""Captain America"" were my favorites.
","At this point, ""The Avengers"" has made around 100 trillion dollars (or so)--and so it's obvious that people love the film. My own daughter went to the premier in New York and then went to it on opening night in general release--and was mad I didn't take her with me tonight to see it! Obviously, she loved the film as well. As for me, I liked it but didn't quite share the overall exuberance for the film. Mind you, I liked it--but I think I preferred the earlier films before the Avengers team was formed. There was a certain charm that I didn't quite see recaptured in the film. Now the film is good--it's just that what I like in these other films I would have liked more of in ""The Avengers"". Specifically, the movie could have used a bit more humor and a bit more character development. When I read the IMDb trivia, it seems that originally the film had about 30 more minutes--all showing Steve Rogers (Captain America) trying to adjust to his new life. I would have LOVED seeing all this--and less of the HUGE battle at the end of the film. For me, it just felt numbing after a while and I would have liked more of the characters when they weren't fighting. Again, however, I DID like the film....but the earlier Marvel/Disney films I liked just a bit better. Just my two cents worth...",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

18,9 July 2012,dee.reid,10," ""The Avengers"" (2012)
","As you well know by now, ""The Avengers"" is a large-scale superhero film that was four years in the making, with no less than four individual - yet inter-connected superhero films - feeding into this film's overall story. Joss ""Firefly"" Whedon was the director and co-writer on this highly ambitious project that is an adaptation of the Marvel Comics superhero team co-created by Stan Lee (who also appears in a very small cameo, like almost every other movie adaptation of a superhero he had a hand in creating) and the late Jack Kirby. Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Natasha Romanoff/The Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), and Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) are the six misfits chosen by Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Samuel L. Jackson) to defeat the traitorous Asgardian misfit Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and his alien army from laying waste to New York City. And of course, six characters usually accustomed to working alone have to work out their differences and come together as a team to save the world. What gets ""The Avengers"" many points is that beside its big action sequences, fights and special effects, we never really lose sight of the characters (who are usually relegated to the background in a movie like this) and who they are. I liked that the movie actually spent time developing the individual characters so that we get to know them all over again - even though they've all already appeared in previous superhero films. It's all big superhero fun, with a knowing wink and an outstanding sense of humor that manages to elicit some strong laughs from anyone viewing this thing with an open mind.

I don't remember when I enjoyed a movie this much! Such cool fantasy but what makes it extra special is following this film after all the other solo efforts from each character. I enjoyed the others films quite a bit but they all delivered something different. Seeing them blend together in Avengers and the sparks that resulted was the extra special treat. Example: They blended the grounded futurist (Tony Stark) with the Norse thunder god and his angry brother in a perfect way. Same could be said for every other character. It all works. In fact, it doesn't just fit, it's a symphony and that dyconomy and difference in characters are what makes it truly great. It's why this movie stands so tall above any other franchise at the moment.

28,21 May 2012,saadgkhan,10," Finest superhero movie ever
","The Avengers – CATCH IT ( A+ ) The anticipation for the avenger's movie is undeniable. We have been waiting for this from years. To understand the Avenger's movie it's really important that you've seen all previous Ironman, the Incredible Hulk, Thor and Captain America's movies. As the avenger's give time to build characterizations for their heroes so getting into the avengers empty headed about hero's history will be foolish. The Avenger's brings back our beloved Marvel's heroes Tony Stark (Iron Man), Thor, Dr. Bruce Banner (Hulk), Steve Rogers (Captain America), Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow), Clint Barton (Hawkeye), Agent Maria Hill, Agent Phil Coulson and Director Nick Fury. Each hero's journey starts from where it ended in their respective movies. Now, The Avenger's stands strong in every department, from direction, production and performances. It won't be wrong to say that it brings out the best out of all the heroes. The humor, action and graphics are far brilliant than all the previous Marvel movies combined. The credit goes to generous brain of Joss Whedon. He brings out something very special out of each superhero. The interaction between all superheroes is something we don't see often, they tease, make fun and even fight with each other. Robert Downey Jr. (Ironman) is great as always. He brings his charming personality and wicked humor into his character which made him the superstar of today. Chris Hemsworth (Thor) is truly a god of thunder. His entry is as Big as Thor's entry should be, it makes you jump of your seat and cheer for him. Chris Evens (Captain America) is indeed the ultimate American Hero, he got the charm and personality of a true America hero. Some of the most standout moments in the movie belong to Mark Ruffalo (The Incredible Hulk). For the first time we see some humor in the actions of Hulk, he is just not a fury green monster this time around. besides Hulk, the biggest surprise is Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow), we have seen the part of her in Ironman movie but this time around we completely understand the strength and wickedness of Black Widow. She is absolutely stunning and fantastic. Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye) is good and I hope to see him someday with Black Widow. They had this amazing chemistry which requires further attention. Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders and Samuel L. Jackson the S.H.E.I.L.D are fun to watch. Tom Hiddleston (Loki) is superb, he was the ultimate villain and considering his brilliant performance in Thor, he has out done himself again. Gwyneth Paltrow (Pepper Potts) appearance is appreciated and I would have loved to see Natalie Portman (Jane Foster) in it too. On the whole, The Avengers is the finest brilliant superhero movie of all time, it's filled with great performance, humor, action, graphics and brilliant direction.

Robert Downey Jr. brings his usual panache to the fore as Tony Stark/Iron Man, and Chris Evans is a wonderfully well-scrubbed Captain America, but others in the all-star cast (particularly Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L.

","When my friend asked me to see the Avengers with him I thought he meant the Steed and Mrs Peel Avengers . Unfortunately , it was the comic book Avengers . While I am not such a big superhero action movie fan , I did enjoy the Batman and Watchman movies . However, the Avengers is one film I could have easily passed up . After first battling each other , the Avengers unite and join forces to save the world from the same common enemy . A lot of the action takes place on a gigantic flying aircraft carrier ,No.64 ( not the CV-64 USS Constellation ). This movie consists mostly of very fast paced CGI's and cheesy Iron Man Robert Downey Jr one-liners . Our heroes and (super villain) are practically indestructible as they are beaten to a pulp but always manage to bounce back time after time . I don't know what the Black Widow's super powers were except martial arts and pistol shooting . Some unintentionally funny moments came when Iron Man Downey was speaking from inside his metal suit . It looked like a talking head from inside a goldfish bowl . It just looked so silly ! There isn't much chemistry between these cardboard characters either . If you are 10 years old or an adult with the maturity of a 14 year old boy , who is obsessed with reading comic books, and are addicted to video games, I'm sure the Avengers is your cup of tea . If not, you will be thinking of the 143 boring minutes you just wasted or what other movies were playing next door you could have seen . If you do decide to see this movie , select a seat in the last row to avoid nausea . I would like to see movies that rely so much on CGI's to be made into animated full length cartoons instead .

This is also the best Hulk film ever made and makes it more of a shame that the ball was dropped so badly in his own films.

","This is one of those movies that has both good points and bad points. For starters, I thought ""Iron Man"" (Robert Downey Jr.) and ""the Hulk"" (Mark Ruffalo) were absolutely sensational. Likewise, most of the other characters were well played too. On the flip-side though the introduction of ""Hawkeye"" (Jeremy Renner) was terribly planned and presented. Not only was the character development badly mishandled but the fact that this person got so much screen time when there were others with much better credentials just boggles the mind. Not only that but his costume-or basic lack thereof-also stuck out like a sore thumb. Additionally, although I liked the CGI I thought it and the non-stop action were just too overwhelming. Even more important was the fact that there were too many characters and not enough film to go around between them. This made the film look extremely uneven. Too many cooks do indeed spoil the soup. Be that as it may, this movie should have been very good but in all frankness it turned out to be a jumbled mess. All things considered then I think the really good points were dragged down by the lack of direction which resulted in a very mediocre film.

","Ugh! ""Avengers"" wore me out. Lets begin with this spoilfest review. The character I was most looking forward to being fleshed out was Hawkeye, who starts out as a zombie.... Loki has a good entrance, but his alien-buddies are never fleshed out, named, or given any character development whatsoever. Apparently, their ""advance warfare"" includes just really-drunken aerial driving. Thor was a pure letdown. He had no swagger, wasn't boisterous, and his costume changed without rhyme or reason. PLUS, he just *poof* appeared, and this killed the beautiful and tragic unrequited love ending of ""THOR"". PLUS, PLUS, he didn't even try to find Jane, or even pound her with a hailstorm or anything! Maria Hill was just annoying eye-candy whose stunning visage countered her lack of plot-points. And Captain America was lackluster. Black Widow was okay. Hulk was funny, but it was kind of creepy how he went after Black Widow. He spends half the movie telling everyone not to bring out the bad guy, then he kind of reveals in the movies silliest moment that, oh, golly gee, I can do this anytime I want to. And Pepper Potts as a daisy-duke wearing penthouse babe? I don't think so. The worst continuity of the series fell on Iron Man. At the end of ""The Incredible Hulk"", it was setup where Tony Stark was forming the Avengers, then we find out in ""The Avengers"" that he wouldn't even be accepted? No Odin, No Jane, No tender flashback scene for Cap's love-interest... I felt the movie really could have benefited from some roller-coaster ride, instead of all peaks. I was surprised to see ""Jenny Agutter"" listed in the credits, apparently she was an unnamed council-member who was so poorly lit she didn't stand out. The best part was Agent Coulson who died (wtf?). And who was the rogue pilot who took it upon himself to nuke New York? No hints at future teammates....

It has a couple moments of delight (but so did the Phantom Menace), and the effects are state of the art, bar none. But, this is the 50th movie in a row where the photorealistic effects impressed me.

74,30 October 2014,lucyyy,10," Avengers is an amazing movie with an amazing cast
","""The Avengers"" brings together a group of extremely talented actors and epic superheroes, to create an action packed movie with hilarious banter laced into countless scenes. Superhero movies give actors a chance to play new characters with personalities they have never portrayed before. Chris Evans is the extremely passionate and kind hearted Captain America, while Robert Downey Jr is the tougher and sassier Iron Man. The film is very creative with introducing each character and later bringing them together. The villain, Loki Laufeyson, played by Tom Hiddleston, even shows his weak spots and is almost seen as part of the Avengers team. The actors have fantastic chemistry with each other on and off screen, and they make man- tights and capes look more fashionable than ever. The majority of the film is done by special effects, made by an amazing team. They transform New York City into a place for heroes, placing Tony Stark's towering house in the middle of the city. Even at the end of the film, the unsuspecting Tony Stark is willing to sacrifice himself for the good of everyone else. This is a wonderful movie to watch if you want to be thoroughly entertained while having your feeling played with at the same time.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","Without a doubt, THE AVENGERS is the most expensive video game ever produced; why the techs would want to try to integrate live-action elements, however, is beyond me: the cartoon was okay without them. Robert Downey has the best lines (half a dozen one-liners, to be precise), though Thor's contention that Loki ""was adopted"" was just as funny. Sam Jackson looks just plain bored throughout- which is saying a lot when one considers the fact that he's the most overrated actor in Hollywood. You know a movie's heavily padded when fully one-third of it could be cut and never missed: the first third of this game is mind-numbingly clichéd and plays out like yet another pseudo-military video game (what used to be called ""first-person shooter"" games but are nowadays referred to as ""first-person action"" games) or television show the likes of which we've seen a thousand times. The skrull at the end was a nice little touch, but I wonder why comics- and now their celluloid incarnations- tend to focus on alien invasions for their ""big get-togethers"" when there are more than enough wannabe tyrants here on Earth...?

","It's finally here. OH MY GOD. As a big comic fan it's amazing to see how far the genre has come in the last decade. We finally get star studded spin-off featuring a large cast of some of the greatest characters. If you've been living under a rock, then you may not have noticed that over the last five years, Marvel have been churning out their big hitters and building up to The Avengers. Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and Hulk join forces to stop Thor's brother, Loki and his alien army. Sure, the plot is simple, but that's what we want for a big smackdown. For any team we need a great leader and Marvel have found the best in Joss Whedon. With his familiarity with large ensembles he effortlessly gives every hero their due. He also manages to flesh out characters in very short scenes. We get a sense of Stark and Potts relationship, some back story for Black Widow and Hawkeye, the confusion of Rogers and so forth. He does his best work with Hulk. I've loved every incarnation of the Hulk so far, so I was wary of Ruffalo's performance. He captures it perfectly, going for a more nervous and geeky Banner. When the Hulk is unleashed, Whedon makes sure to not take it too seriously. Hulk gets the biggest laughs in this surprisingly comic film. The action is fantastic, with a number of exciting set pieces. The final battle has so many wonderful character moments immersed in the action, and they really do work as a team. There are a couple of shortcomings. The alien race is just pathetic, and never really feels like a threat. Add to that the whole mother ship destroyed and every alien dies plot convenience. The film lacks any real threat. We hear about the many people Loki kills, but we never see anything that relates to this. Without seeing the sacrifices made it's hard to get too involved. There are also a few moments where characters just happen to show up. These are things that are minor nitpicks. After all, the only way to do a perfect Avengers movie would be to have an unlimited budget and unlimited running time. What it does achieve is simply amazing and very exciting for the future of superhero films.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","Everything has converged perfectly, delivering what is now the new king of the genre. The Avengers is certainly the best overall comic adaptation film ever made. Really, how could it not be? They positioned this thing with FIVE other set up films that were each remarkable in their own right. Not only does it all come together but I'm happy to say this amazing cast delivers in every way. Believe it or not, every single character featured previously in those five films gets time to really shine at one point or another in this astounding movie. Even though the set up has been epic, the result was anything but assured. It would have been easy to be overwhelmed by the task of putting all these great character together and making it click but they pulled it off perfectly. Maybe it's because the characters themselves are complex and intriguing and that they have been brought to three dimensional life by people that really care. Whatever the case, EVERYONE hits a home run here. They fleshed out perfect cohesion while remembering to include the fun and humor that have made those other five films good.

","Here we have ""The Avengers"", the five-year-old movie from 2012 that was really breaking all box office records back 5 years ago. The director and co-writer was Joss Whedon, at that point mostly known for Buffy and Toy Story, the film that brought him an Oscar nomination. But now, this one here is certainly his career-defining work. The era of superhero blockbuster films had already started back then and RDJ's Iron Man franchise was going well enough for using his popularity to bring up a Marvel superhero all-stars film. Thor and Captain America of course have their own films now too. But back to this one here. Hiddleston was still doing a good job and Loki as a villain definitely does not get old too quickly. Some great potential this character has. Not a surprise at all, Whedon was also going for comedy next to the fantasy, drama and action sequences. Most of it was working out well like the restaurant scene at the very end. The only parts I did not like from the comedy perspective were probably the Tony Stark one-liner moments, but that's also subjective.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

But the fact that they brought together all of these different characters from all these different movies and put them together in 2 1/2 hour film was unprecedented and almost seemed impossible. But the optimist in me got me to the theater with me expectations shaky. Once the film started I was quickly drawn in and once the title appeared on the screen I knew that Joss Whedon had done it. The Avengers is without a doubt my favorite Marvel film and even my favorite action film ever made. Whedon did a great job writing this masterful, witty script that ingeniously put together all these characters and made it flow perfectly. The actors did such a great job playing these characters again and it didn't seem like anyone was underutilized and everyone got a chance to be in the spotlight(especially the hulk). Once you see all of the characters assemble and fight the bad guys you can't help but fill with happiness. The entire movie was such a fun thrill ride from the beginning to the end and the ending battle scene was brilliantly done.

I admit, the first time i saw this movie in theaters, i was having a blast and enjoying it very much. However, the film gets worse for me each time i give it a second watch. The film is centered around Loki(played by Tom Hiddleston), who wants to take over the world, while the avengers work out their ways to stop him. It is as generic and lazy as it sounds. The film barely has any story or even character development/interaction. It's nothing but one liners and action. None of the characters have a defined personality. Tony Stark is a one dimensional clown, Thor is has the charm of a wood that speaks in a Shakespearean way, black widow and hawkeye are nearly the same, only their gender are different. Hulk has his moments, and captain America is one of the most boring comic book characters i have ever seen in this movie. It's basically a Michael Bay movie minus the women objectifying, but same level of obnoxious and out dated film making. One of the most overrated trash movies i have ever seen.

","I missed this movie when it came out at the cinema because, from what I could see from the trailers and elsewhere, it looked a bit 'silly' for want of a better word, kid's stuff perhaps. We've come to expect much more from comic book interpretations. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the Iron Man series, Spiderman and Batman reboots. Where I draw the line I think, is with characters such as Thor and Captain America and to a lesser extent the Hulk - characters who haven't dated too well at all and should have been left in their respective times. They just look so out of place sitting along side the more believable and 'cooler' looking characters like Iron man in present day settings. But anyhow, having seen the high ratings the movie was getting (including on here) I thought 'maybe it cant be so bad after all?' and gave it a look. Sadly my initial instinct was right - this film is well made, has great CGI and acting, but.. its entirely spoilt by the inclusion of silly outdated characters with dubious special powers and a guy who turns into a CGI cartoon green man/monster. I realise that it wouldn't be as much of an assemble without these characters and to substitute spiderman or other superheroes might well upset some purists, but might have made for a better film. Thor in particular is from a bygone era of comic books and should have been left there.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

You know - characters that evolve, logically sound motivations and tensions, good pacing, an antagonist defeated through skill rather than luck - that sort of thing. From this perspective, the setup movies fell mostly flat for me. Iron Man was fabulous fun but it's sequel was poor. The Hulk was meh.

In one word – Superb. I don't mind watching it once again. S.H.I.E.L.D director, Nick Fury is threatened by Loki and his armed forces. Loki is sinister brother of Thor who was dethroned from Kingdom of Asgard for his misdeeds. He plans an attack on Earth by opening a portal through which his army can arrive into the Earth from Asgard and wage a war against mankind and turn human into Loki's slave. In order to protect Earth from destruction, Nick Fury assembles a team of superheroes represented by Ironman , Captain America , Thor and Hulk along with Black Widow and HawkEye. Together , they must fight the evil Loki before he captures the people of earth and turns them into his slave It would have been really challenging for Joss Whedon, director of Serenity, to make a film by assembling all the superheroes in one flick but to my surprise he did a fantastic job and turned this comic-story into a must-see film. The movie begins by introducing each superhero character and their personalities. Of course, if you would have followed their original parts then this will be easy to continue. The differences between the characters has been portrayed ecstatically. 1st half is more of story building where as it is the 2nd half which gathers steam and makes it more entertaining. Couple of scenes that easily stands out are the introduction of Hulk , the fight between Thor and Ironman and especially the climax scenes where the main fighting is depicted. Screenplay is effective along with punching dialogues Cinematography is enthralling. The CGI is magnificent with thrilling visual effects. On the flip side , any superhero movie is supported by electrifying background which is clearly missing here. Nevertheless, it is compensated by powerful performances by rest of the starcast. Robert Downey Jr. clearly stands out in his portrayal of Ironman and witty one- liners. He is just getting better with each film. Surprisingly, I liked Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/The Hulk. His puts in so much effort and is complete natural when as Bruce Banner and his change of expression as The Hulk.

When Mark Ruffalo was announced as taking over the mantle of the gamma powered being with anger management issues, I'm sure many like myself would have been bewildered, but Ruffalo shows why he's the best Hulk just yet, and is a mean Bruce Banner as well. We get back to seeing Banner being a scientist, enlisted not for his raging abilities, but that of being the go to expert on gamma radiation. That doesn't mean he's a pushover when it comes to the crunch, and with Ruffalo being motion captured rather than having the Hulk purely CG, is something different, not to mention the countless of cool scenes the big monster gets himself into thanks to his powered abilities.

","The Avengers is simply a superb movie in every way that matters. Forget comparing it to other films of the genre. I'll save that for a later date because it really isn't important. Judging it as a stand alone piece of entertainment, it's the best time I've had in theaters in a very long time. First off, forget what you think you know or expect because it operates at a higher level then anyone would have guessed. There is very little clichéd about the film. They establish their own universe by themselves but it is so aided by all the previous solo lead in films. If you've seen them all, you're in for a real treat with Avengers. If you haven't, you'll enjoy them MORE now watching them after Avengers. They fearlessly take the adventure wire to wire but manage to make you really care about every circumstance, character and scene. Every character is believable given the nature of the universe they establish. You really are drawn in to the world and to the each and every character right from the first act. That connection makes the action more meaningful, just like with the best of movies regardless of genre. The dialog has been called superb by fans and critics alike for a reason. The conflict and tension present between EVERYONE (protagonist, antagonist, friend, and foe) absolutely makes the film. The performances that stem off of that are all remarkable. The charisma this film packs, and there's plenty of it, comes from the flawless performances and the dialog. Also, the supporting cast is utilized perfectly. This is as good and as fun of a film that has ever been made. Bold statement, I know. I rarely rely on critics but when nine out of ten of them praise this film they are doing so for a reason.

I thought the way they tied in parts or Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger through the Tesseract was cool. I also liked how the movie centered around Loki and his quest to rule Midgard (Earth), by stealing the Tesseract from a S. H. I. E. L. D base, taking command of Hawkeye, Selvig and Shield agents, and him teaming up with the Chitauri to attack New York and eventually the world. The story and dialogue was even good, I liked how the Avengers would always bicker together, and I also liked the punny jokes. I also loved the fact that the soul reason The Avengers decided to work together was due to the death of Coulson. Like always, the acting by everyone was great, even the new additions. Lastly, Tom Hiddleston as Loki was absolutely amazing. He played the role to perfection again.

","The Avengers (2012): Dir: Joss Whedon / Cast: Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson: Here at long last is a combination of comic book superheros brought to the screen to the delight of fans. Hopefully nobody will confuse the title with that crap handed John Steed Emma Peel 1998 film that everyone wanted nothing to do with. Perhaps a title change? We have a host of superheros including Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, The Hulk, Hawkeye, and Black Widow. The villain is Loki of the Thor film and he has a world domination scheme that is every bit as corny as any other world domination scheme. That doesn't matter because viewers will attend to see the combination of powers become a reality. Loki is a great villain and thankfully he is targeted by all of these heroes thus giving us great action sequences. His run-in with the Hulk is especially amusing. Joss Whedon is the right director to bring this spectacular together and the special effects created are explosive. Whedon also gives each cast member a good fair share of time. We have Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark / Iron Man whose sarcasm is a scene stealer. Chris Evans is thawed and ready as Captain America. Chris Hemsworth as Thor sets to bring Loki back to his planet for justice. Mark Ruffalo is terrific filling in as the Hulk whose anger is subdued until fans are given the payoff in full blown green fury. Scarlett Johansson oozes sexiness as Black Widow, a skilled spy trained by S.H.I.E.L.D. Third act descends to action combination of the various talented ensemble that is a thrill.

This super team will remain more or less together in this primary incarnation blowing our super hero film loving minds through 'Endgame' in 2019. Joss Whedon does a stellar job as a geek fanboy extraordinaire in the director's chair. This film combines a wonderful script with depth and plenty of the on the nose humor that these MCU films have excelled at.

The plot is, Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Bruce Banner and Thor are recruited by Nick Fury and the spy agency S. H. I. E. L. D. to stop Thor's brother Loki from taking over the world. Now, to some, that story may sound a little bit too miniscule. However, for a film of this caliber, a simple plot is warranted. It allows for extra character development, as well as better action and fight scenes. In some cases, that may be too many characters for one movie alone, and there's not too much character development. But, here's the thing, in the films leading up to this one, we already met these characters and know everything we need to know about them. That's one critical thing Marvel did correctly, they did individual superhero movies and built up to the team-up. Whereas DC did it backwards, and did the climactic team-up first then the individual films later. They just had the heroes run into the action without any character development. That's one of the biggest cardinal rules of cinema, in my opinion, character development. Without that, then the movie won't have any impact. Marvel did it all correctly, and stared with character development first, and that's what allows for ""The Avengers"" to shine even more. Unlike watching modern day DC films, when you watch Marvel movies, you actually care about the characters and what's going on. Any way, I won't go into any details about the plot. But, I guarantee that it's a story that you'll remember for the rest of your life. This film may be 142 minutes in length, but it goes by in the blink of an eye. When a long movie goes by fast, you know it's a winner! As far as the acting goes, it's just as outstanding as the story itself. The whole cast gives it their all with their performances. That's another thing Marvel superhero films do better than DC, acting. Good acting is critical for a movie to stand out. It just shows how passionate Marvel Studios is, and makes this film all the more enjoyable. The cast is absolutely insane, their on-screen chemistry is impeccable! All of the sets/locations are beautiful, and give the film an stunning atmosphere. They really help make it look like a real-life comic book! As far as the special effects go, they are perfect and still hold up to this day. Which is no surprise, being made in 2012! Finally, the soundtrack composed by Alan Silvestri is exceptional and his film score sets the perfect tone for the movie. Alan Silvestri is one of my top ten all-time favorite film score composers, and the soundtrack for this movie is no different. Every film score I've heard written by him is very well done, to say the least and this one here is no different. ""The Avengers"" is a phenomenal superhero movie, and it has found a place on my top five favorite Marvel films. It's still just as fun to watch today, as it was back when it was first released. I can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. I'm giving this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""The Avengers"", what are you waiting for? Go and see it today! Just skip it's sequel, ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015), that movie sucks and it's easily the worst Marvel Cinematic Universe film. But, before you see ""The Avengers"", I recommend watching the first few movies first. It'll make the payoff with this film much more worth it. If you don't watch ""The Avengers"", look out for Loki!",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","I don't care about what some people say on how this movie just had action and no story and cheesy humor because those people obviously have no taste. Anyways, I just got a chance to see the most awaited film of 2012 and honestly, I wasn't disappointed. The movie was actually the most epic movie I have seen so far. Yes, I might change this decision after I see The Dark Knight Rises or MIB 3 but this movie has certainly impressed me. The movie has major plus points and one of them is the dialogs. The mix of action and humorous dialogs entertain and provide good moments to appease the audiences. I am sure, several people loved the dialogs but I just admired them. The action scenes, were not overdone and were certainly better than G.I Joe series which was not really anything impressive for me. But, there is a lot more to this film that gave me that feeling that this is the epic movie and It wasn't a waste to wait for so long. The action scenes are good, though there was a lot of explosions, they impress. The best part is the acting, our superheroes and even our villain say funny dialogs and perform good action. Plus, the story is effective for a 2 hour movie as many movies longer than 1 hour 30 mins are usually lagging in parts and fail to present a good story. But, this movie doesn't drag and doesn't make you fall asleep. Acting is top notch, Robert Downy Jr. is the best, Thor is good, Captain America, the rest are awesome.

","The Avengers didn't age well but is a highly entertaining movie regardless of your knowledge of its characters and universe. Sure it's cliche and super predictable just like any other superhero movie, but remember this is nothing that you should take seriously. It's just a big excuse to get all your favorite characters kicking each other's butts on screen with great special effects. Compared to all previous MCU movies it's very well-paced and while being fun and self-mocking it never gets to unbearable peaks of trashiness. The writing was surprisingly well-cared too this time. The characters have good chemistry, and each one of them gets introduced the right way, with the right amount of information being given still without getting too verbose. I still don't think that having Hulk suddenly being able to control his powers is a good idea though. It pretty much kills the whole concept of being indestructible but a threat to anybody around him at the same time. I understand that there are times he can't control himself when under stress like in the first part of the movie, but it's still too much of an easy card to play. Having the Avengers use his powers against the enemies but struggling to keep him in control at the same time would be more believable and balance the game better. Also Loki after being presented as the ultimate bad guy the first half of the movie gets completely lost after the aliens come in. Didn't feel his threat at all.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","Ladies and gentlemen, WE HAVE A WINNER! Most Superhero comic book movies seem to share a problem in tone. Most films try to cope with wild concepts by emphasizing darkness, even over-emphasizing it. Troubled, brooding characters, black leather and anger rule the day. Here, the Avengers mix everything so well. It leans to the dark but touches on fun and the interaction of every character just enough. Maybe it's the fact that all the lead characters got their chance to be introduced in their own movies or maybe it's because they wanted genuinely real dialogue but the movie feels real and believable. It's truly better than any other comic-book based movie that I have ever seen. I say that not to egg on fans of other properties because I AM a fan of other properties. Because of the groundwork that has come before and because of the high level that this film operates, it IS bigger than any have ever delivered. ALL the dramatic beats really click. Besides the depth and action pieces, so much of the humor works because it is so well written. The writing displays true character establishment and development over the course of the film but never gets bogged down by the shear number of characters. What's also rare for any summer movie is that just about every scene packs real emotional weight. This is what you get when you mix fine acting talent with outstanding material. They make it shine and give you a remarkable movie that people will be talking about for years to come. The TV clips seen leading up to the movie tease at the action but there is SO much they saved for the actual running. I can't thank them enough for that factor. They knew they had a hit on their hands so why spoil the word of mouth! If you liked the trailers and TV stuff, YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING YET! That in and of itself was a pleasant surprise.

If I have to guess it's the amazing chemistry between the actors and a great writing (unlike awful Game of Thrones,season 8), which makes it tick. There are no grade A actors in it , aside perhaps Robert Downy Jr. and Sam L Jackson, yet in this one, every one is a star. Both Evans and Hemsworth embrace their role to perfection and aren't just a pretty face. They are captain America and Thor respectively, and I cant' imagine anyone else in that role. A typical acting of Mark Ruffalo, actually works perfectly and one might say that he did his difficult role of Hulk even better than Ed Norton, whom I personally consider to be one of the best, though notoriously known difficult to work with, actors. Scarlet Johanson Gave a superb performance and for me this is one of her best movies ever. Not to forget everyone else, who gave an outstanding performance. This movie is not without its flaws, yet the sheer enjoyment and inspiration it provides, makes up for it.

","It has been a long time since I've anticipated a summer movie season as much as I've anticipated 2012's. And what better way to kick it off than with one of the most anticipated movies of...well if not the decade, then at least the last 5 years. The Avengers was a very impressive accomplishment by Joss Whedon, and it was well worth the wait. This is one of those movies that had its work cut out for it for quite some time. This was going to take some skill as a movie-maker. How in the world would anyone be able to bring all of these larger-than-life characters together in such a way that it would not seem too jammed packed and jumbled up for its own good? How would all of these heroes be showcased in a movie that is almost all main-character and lead actor? And to answer those questions, all I can really say is this: I don't know. And after seeing the movie, I still don't know. All I know is that it was done, and it was done very well. I have to admit, when I found out Whedon was going to be at the helm for this one, I had some doubts (which, I'll admit were only based on my lack of attention to most of his work as a writer). However, after seeing Cabin In The Woods a few weeks ago, I saw what Whedon was able to accomplish with what was, technically a film that goes into the horror genre, but really was one of the best and unique films I've seen in a long time. And even though he was only a script writer for Cabin, anyone who knows anything at all about screenplays knows that that was one that was penned by a very talented and creative guy. So at that point I was more than convinced that he could pull off something great with The Avengers, and after seeing it tonight, it's safe to say that Whedon was certainly quite up for this task. If you love movies then go see this one. It has the action, it has the acting, and more than anything (and is so important when it comes to a film like this) it has the story and script. This is the quintessential summer movie that everyone hopes for. But, and this is the good part, it's also got so much more that makes it so much more than the quintessential summer movie. So, the summer movie season has officially arrived. And now, the rest of the season has its work cut out for it.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

But I got to say, this is one rare movie that really focuses on and mixes great action, swift camera movements, and hilarious touches of humor in one package. For a movie that's well over two hours, there isn't very many slow scenes (except maybe some action sequences) and it feels like the story moves along nice and quick. All the heroes and their actors all had their unique parts. As with the other Marvel movies, it's always fun to spot Stan Lee. From the Avengers getting together to the battle in New York City, it was a fun journey while it lasted. All I got to say is that the Hulk was visually updated and looked amazing in this movie.

This movie seemed to be lacking in character development and back story that make movies like the first Iron Man, X-men and The Dark Knight exceptional. It felt like I should have done my homework before seeing this one. This movie had a lot of action, but I never felt connected to the characters I hadn't seen before - Captain America, Thor, the Scarlett Johanssen character and the Jeremy Renner character. The Hulk was very inconsistent as well. In some parts of the movie he was uncontrollable, and in other parts he was a team player. And how did Hawk Eye take so long run out of arrows??? My idea of a ""great"" movie is that you get to know the characters through the movie itself. I shouldn't be expected to watch four or five other movies to get it. I enjoyed it, just not as much as I would have expected. Both my wife and I needed to get to the credits see get the character names of Black Widow and Hawk Eye.

Also, if I'm being completely honest, I went in assuming it would be another highly overrated superhero movie that couldn't like up to the hype. It definitely wouldn't be the first time I disagreed with the critics. Boy was I mistaken. Outside of the films from Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, this is easily the best superhero movie ever made. They plot developed perfectly, the action sequences were incredible, there were a lot of unexpectedly humorous scenes and dialogue, and the characters and actors were all great. One of my concerns going in was how they would possibly give each character their fair shake. Well the great Joss Whedon did a great job keeping a perfect balance between staying true to the individual characters while further introducing a developing Black Widow and Hawkeye. Another thing, Mark Ruffalo did a marvelous job as Bruce Banner. A lot of people were worried about him in that role and were upset about the change from Edward Norton. Maybe it's because I'm biased and loathe Norton but I thought Ruffalo did a better job as Banner. I wouldn't have minded them focusing a little more time on the Hawkeye character and I wouldn't have minded if they actually squeezed in Natalie Portman's character for a quick scene or two but the movie really didn't need it. I just think if you can put Portman on screen, you put Portman on screen, lol. I also wouldn't have minded if they focused a bit more on the villainous pawns and where they come from but I have a feeling we'll find out more about them in the following Avengers sequels so I can't be too upset about that.

The plot is... Wait a second, what plot? The only positive thing in this movie is Robert Downey Jr, but he alone cannot make up for all the flaws that exist in this movie. Certain points in the movie feel very long, and I assume this is because of the actors lack of talent, they are dull and have no feelings.

","""The Avengers"" is a great exercise in the art of fantasy movie-making. Its exemplary and superior production value, great performance by a stellar cast all portraying iconic superheroes, clever and witty dialogues (albeit with some nonchalant sarcasm thrown by RDJ as the charismatic and philanthropic billionaire with an obsession for high end technology and sophisticated gadgets), superb pacing nary a monotonous moment, adequate and sufficient background information for the uninitiated (those who haven't seen Thor, Captain America, The Incredible Hulk & The Iron Man franchise) but not overly cumbersome in its flashback of the introductory sequences, magnificent cinematography and mesmerizing VFX, profusely suitable background score without unnecessary cacophony and a brilliant, tight-knit plot giving each and every character enough time and screen presence to develop their respective characters, makes this as the best movie of 2012 by far without any hyperbole and on par with Batman:Dark Knight as possibly the greatest Superhero Movie, comprising of a heavy hitting ensemble cast delivering undoubtedly MARVEL's finest effort till date. Director Joss Whedon has done an exceptional and brilliant job. A must watch movie, which is surely going to be an Epic. It's an amazing movie full of heart, gravitas, emotion and depth. The On-screen chemistry between all the lead characters is uncanny and unparalleled. 10/10, a must watch for every Hollywood movie buff & Superhero aficionado.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012
334,13 May 2012,zardoz-13,10," One of the Best Super Hero Epics!!!
","Since the epilogue in ""Iron Man"" (2008) when Nick Fury broached the idea of the Avengers Initiative to wisecracking Tony Stark, Marvel Comics has been patiently whetting our appetites for ""The Avengers."" This imaginative ensemble epic assembles not only Iron Man and Hulk, but also Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Nick Fury. Agent Phil Coulson is back, too. Ostensibly, these paragons of virtue are all that stand between Thor's scheming step-brother Loki and the fate of mankind. Happily, Loki brings more to the table than he did in Kenneth Branagh's anemic ""Thor."" Indeed, Thor and Loki seem to have matured considerably during the interim. Loki ranks as a first-rate villain; he is ready, willing, and eager to kill anybody who confronts him, and actor Tom Hiddleston relishes every moment. Ultimately, ""The Avengers"" qualifies as Marvel's ambitious attempt to deliver an all-star, no-holds-barred, alien invasion thriller to rival both ""Independence Day"" and ""Transformers"" franchise. Of course, we know that our heroes won't capitulate, but this 142-minute, PG-13 extravaganza takes everything down to the wire. Inevitably, the extraterrestrial villain--only hardcore Marvel Comics fans may recognize him—who boasts about subjugating Earth is as presumptuous as audiences who fail to appreciate the artistry of ""The Avengers."" Unlike other ensemble pieces—like the venerable ""Star Trek"" movies that always relegated some regulars to obscurity, ""The Avengers"" gives everybody a chance to perform an integral part in this larger-than-life smackdown. Reportedly, ""Serenity"" director Joss Whedon shot more footage of Captain America than reached the screen. Nevertheless, the fish-out-of-water, World War II hero still participates in a major way. Melodramatic, with more humor than you might imagine, but just enough tragedy to make things bittersweet, ""The Avengers"" doesn't wear out its welcome. Moreover, this far-fetched nonsense holds up under repeated showings. I've seen it four times, and it loses none of its spontaneity.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","When the Tesseract suddenly activates itself, it briefly opens a portal. A small one, but nonetheless it allows Loki(who uses his illusions well) to pass through... and he now has a sceptre that allows him to take over people by touch. He escapes with the aforementioned seemingly limitless source of energy, and with the threat of it being used to allow an invasion of Earth by the alien force the Chitari, what can Fury do other than... Assemble Avengers. This is an excellent piece, that lives up to the hype. It will satisfy comic readers and more casual viewers of this franchise alike. A lot of people will be exclaiming that, so I will try to back it up instead of just fawning over this(and believe me, I could go 1000 words just doing that). It follows up on all... no, *all*... of the threads set up in the five films that came before(and yes, it will really help to have watched all of them before this... then again, if you have any interest in this, you probably already have). Nothing is abandoned or ignored. The sheer planning that went into this... and this is still full of fantastic surprises. And for all the development(all of that in this is highly credible, by the way) of characters, powers and conflicts(and this takes the ball and runs with it, and adds the interpersonal relationships of these people who have not shared a screen before now, who are rather different people) that precedes this, there is a solid amount of it in this, as well. All six(and no, you can't tell that two of them, one of them especially, haven't gotten much screen time before this) members of the faction are treated to an astonishing introduction(actually, that goes for Nick and the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier, both very cool, as well), a strong heroic act that only they could have accomplished, *and*... a situation of immense peril(not to mention that they(and we) are treated to one continuous tracking shot that showcases all of them taking names using their talent, one by one, once they've grown into a team, working together... no, they don't start out like that, and yes, there is indeed infighting early on, and yes, we get every one-on-one that anyone wants, and it is glorious... the trailer is literally just the preview). All of them have something to do(and they are recruited gradually, no one overshadowing anyone else... and somehow, this gets all the aspects that make them work individually, in their own movies, somehow, without getting tonal schizophrenia), some reason to be in this, and the threat(Hiddleston is friggin' intimidating) is grand enough that we need all of them, and for them to band together. Tony has to prove that he is selfless, that he doesn't just fix his own mistakes(and he brings his mainstay of taking what can barely even be called calculated risks, that come out to putting a severe dent in the enemies). Steve has to adjust to a world and time completely foreign to him, and bring them all into one, effective unit(and he is the great leader that is required, one that you yourself would follow, and, indeed, a Super Soldier(a title he earns)). Thor(who brings godlike might, and a Shakespearian sibling rivalry with the bad guy) and Natasha(who is the real brains of the operation, and can manipulate the foe... they use one of her qualities well, that being her apparently complete detachment from emotion leading to an uncertainty of what she does feel and what not) are dealing with a lot of guilt, on account of it being an Asgardian causing trouble for the planet and her... dark past as a spy who'd take on missions for or against anyone, respectively. Clint(who brings his specialized arrows and extreme accuracy to good use) has his own to make amends for(you'll see...). Bruce(who comes with the sheer destructive weight of his alter ego) is brought on for his expertise on the subject of Gamma radiation(he can help find the vital cube), and... I don't need to spell out what he feels bad about, do I? He does seem to have gotten the Hulk under control... or has he? This builds up the transformation, and he remains a danger. He's the only one to have another person attached to it than played it last, and while I had no problem with Norton(who I love in other stuff... in that, he didn't do all he could with it, though), this part is Ruffalo's. There is this very terrifying aspect to him, he could metamorphose and cause significant damage and pain... and he plays it like you'd expect him to be, very non-confrontational and anxious, yet smart and confident in his field. All of them risk their lives and limb for the good of mankind, saving countless people. There are not many supporting roles(Phil Coulson does return, and he is enjoyable, with a fandom of Cap; there's also a female agent named Hill, who kicks ass... in fact, every woman in this is hot, independent and not objectified... kudos for that, along with the rest, Whedon), with focus placed where it should be, on the ensemble cast. Is it necessary for me to devote space to let you know that the acting is spot-on? You've already seen Chris, Robert and Liam do incredible, and they do so here, too. Everyone does. The writing is phenomenal. I am struggling to find one line of dialog(with Iron Man-like wit and banter) that isn't quotable, sharp and well-delivered. The action is plentiful, has distinct stages to it(none of that unaimed, mindless crap), culminating in a truly massive climax, and somehow never running out of steam or exhausting the audience. This keeps to a pitch perfect pace, and at nearly two and a half hours, there is nothing tedious or rushed. The FX? Breathtaking. 3D? Used right(only little distinctly moves towards/points at you).

","The Marvel comic book based films have made millions at the box office, and everybody must have been thrilled with a number of the best superheroes of the series being put together in the same film, and presuming you have seen the previous films with them it has been building up to this. Basically Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), director of S.H.I.E.L.D., is meeting some colleagues in a remote facility where the energy source the Tesseract has been found and activated, opening a gateway transporting the Norse god Loki (Tom Hiddleston) from Asgard to Earth. He steals the powerful cube and takes over the minds of personnel like Clint Barton aka Hawkeye (The Hurt Locker's Jeremy Renner) and Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård), and this forces Fury to reactivate the Avengers Initiative, recruiting some of the world's most powerful and special heroes, starting with Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). She goes to find Bruce Banner aka The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) who is hiding somewhere in India for his scientific knowledge of the Tesseract - no mention of ""The Other Guy"", while Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) approaches Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) who also has technological knowledge - and his powerful mechanical suit, and Fury also brings Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans) up to date with the situation, and he is still trying to get used to the modern world. While Loki disappeared into the abyss he was approached by the alien race the Chitauri, led by The Other (Alexis Denisof), and they came to an agreement that if they got the Tesseract they would help him take over the Earth. Suited up, Captain America and Iron Man travel to Germany where Loki is meant to be hiding and trying to ignite and stabilise the power of the cube, showing his evil intent to many people kneeling before him, he surrenders though when they fight and catch him. In this process though the villain's half-brother Thor (Chris Hemsworth) arrives, also transported from Asgard, and he plans to take and deal with him in his own way, and this turns into a fight between him, Iron Man and Captain America, but it eventually stops. Loki is placed into a cell, designed to hold The Hulk inside if Banner turns, and now with Thor recruited as well the Avengers argue about how to handle the alien dictator, and there is the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plan to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons. Fury explains that he heard about what happened in Mexico, when Thor was previously on Earth, and that the attack makes Earth an easy target, and the weapons will be good defence for a similar attack, and as the argument continues Loki's mind controlled agents infiltrate the ship, the Helicarrier. Captain America and Iron Man try to start the engines again, while Thor tries fight against Banner who has become The Hulk and may destroy the ship from the inside, and fighting with Barton, Romanoff discovers a hard hit to the head will knock possessed people back to normal. In the struggle Loki kills Agent Coulson and escapes the ship, Banner as Hulk and Thor are ejected from the ship and fall to the ground, and Fury uses the death of Coulson to encourage the Avengers left to come together, work as a team and save the world. They know that the villain wants to become ruler as well as destroy cities, and using Dr. Selbig he has created a device to open the gateway and allow the Chitauri to invade and attack Manhattan, and it is up to Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Thor and The Hulk to save the day. In the end, after Dr. Selvig is revived, so much explosive fighting, and a prevented missile blowing up in space, Loki is taken back with the Tesseract by Thor to Asgard, the Avengers go their separate ways, until a new threat to the world emerges, and the final scene sees The Other meeting his master, who turns and reveals himself to be Thanos.

It should be noted that the title was changed in Britain from The Avengers because there would be confusion with the Honor Blackman/Dianna Rigg TV series, and also there were small complaints about Spider-Man and Wolverine absent, but it doesn't matter. Anyway, the story and scripting are very well made, and what steals the show is the brilliantly paced fight sequences filled with the most spectacular and ground breaking special effects to create all the superhero gadgets and gimmicks, invading creatures, and constant explosions, this is definitely one of the greatest superhero movies of the last few years, a must see action fantasy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Special Visual Effects. Very good!",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","""There was an idea to bring together a group of remarkable people, so when we needed them, they could fight the battles that we never could."" After the God Loki finds his way to Earth, steals the powerful Tesseract and is close to fulfilling his goal of destroying the planet there is only one group that can stop him. After years of recruiting Nick Fury's (Jackson) team is ready. This is a movie that people will pretty much just watch without any prompting or reading reviews because of the hype and build up but I'll do one anyway. I have to start by saying that I never was a huge comic book movie person. When they first started being made it was pretty much just how much stuff can we explode and how cool can we make it look. Over the years they have been getting better and better and I think the success of the ""Batman"" movies by Christopher Nolan has raised the bar. He has shown that a real story, plot and great acting can make a typical ""popcorn"" movie into a legitimate movie. All the years of honing the genre have led to this. Not only is this a fun movie to watch but it is also a great acted movie and everyone is perfectly cast. Downey is the leader but is in no way overpowering and this has the feel of a real ensemble cast movie in the way that ""Crash"" did. After years of movies like the ""Fantastic 4"" and ""Spiderman"" they finally realized the key to not just making a good comic book movie, but a great movie period. Good acting and writing are needed. Both are on display here. I have said for years that I am not a comic book movie fan...this movie may have changed my mind. Overall, not just a good and fun comic book movie but a good a fun movie...period. I give it an A-.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012
369,22 June 2012,RNMorton,10," It all fits together
","The most recent Marvel comics film efforts have had several things in common - excellent casting, just spot on casting; great characters developed for years through the Marvel comics; good dialogue; but often muddled and/or derivative plots, and usually overlong. For example, Spiderman 3 had chunks of useless segments and a plot shamelessly recycled from earlier Spiderman movies, interspersed with some gorgeous moments of action. This one is interesting. It wouldn't have been as effective without all the introductory movies for many of the characters, including Captain America, Iron Man and Thor, which actually set the table for this main course. The collection of heroes make this movie greater than the sum of the individual works, it just fits like a glove. There are so many good performances - Evans is good again as Capt. A; Downey has made Iron Man his own, and he's got most of the best lines; Ruffalo is amazing as The Hulk; Johannson is solid as the Widow; Jackson and Gregg fit as Nick Fury and his top agent; and just maybe Renner trumps them all as the unflappable Hawkeye. I saw this with my youngest in 3-D, the next night I went back with both my kids and saw it again in 3-D and enjoyed it just as much. Hiddleston does an admirable Jaye Davidson-esque turn as the bad guy, with some help from an other-worldly invasion force. The CGI stuff works, interspersed with some eye-opening live action. The best moment comes when the camera does a slow 360 degree circuit of the Avengers circling the wagons in NYC. There's a lot going on here, and there still is some fat mixed in with the meat, but as a whole this thing just works grandly.

What more or less usual humans like Black Widow and Hawkeye can do to survive such a battlefield for super heroes is beyond my understanding, too. Not to mention the usual showcasing of US equipment (F-35 e.g.) and a ""skycarrier"" which in some way made me think of ""Space Battleship Yamato"". And last but not least no one of the ones responsible seems to have read Marvel comics when they have been young; I did, and there's no way that Iron Boy and Miss America could hold up to Thor and Hulk. How did Iron Man put it correctly in the comics (with regard to Thor/Hulk): ""With enough energy I can keep up with those guys (on the Super Hero top list)...for two seconds."" The end with interviews and statements on the streets and of course before that the use of nukes to close the portal brought my till then five stars vote down to three.

The Hulks special effects look a million times better in this film as compared to The Incredible Hulk, and though I liked Edward Nortons performance, Mark Buffalo also does an amazing job as a recast.

389,30 April 2012,Donnie_Quixotic,4," Wanted to love it, but couldn't
","I've seen the inflated review aggregate, and at the risk of being dismissed a contrarian, I seriously disagree with the accolades. The Avengers movie I saw contained no character development whatsoever; no character starts off ignorant, growing to enlightenment, or overcomes cowardice to become a hero, or any other example of behavioral character arcs. By the end, they are as they begun, unchanged, and definitively two-dimensional. The lack of character development is compounded by uninteresting, witless, filler dialogue (despite a few one-liners which managed to draw a giggle), with Dr. Stark and Dr. Banner, i.e. the alter egos of Iron-man and the Hulk, occasionally foraying into esoteric scientific jibber-jabber, that only served to bore me even more. In saying that, Downey Jr's, Tony Stark was the only mildly interesting and amusing character in the entire piece; the rest of the characters I couldn't give a shite about, despite liking them in their stand-alone movies. It seems Director Joss Whedon and pen pal, Zak Penn, are unaware of the law of diminishing returns, whereby the repetition of anything – in this case, fist-fights, and gun and super-power battles – eventually numbs to the point of indifference. Speaking of indifference, the limp-wristed, laughable, horn-wearing villain, Loki, was about as menacing as having a series of ping pong balls pitched at you. And the death of (no spoiler here) was about as emotionally moving as having your pet weevil larvae die. Effects-wise it seems despite the advances in CGI made by Avatar, and Rise of the Planet of the Apes, The Avengers decided to go retrograde, the Hulk looking nothing more than a three-dimensional cartoon, and likewise with Iron-Man and the endless stream of generic alien henchmen. The green-screen for the most part looked phony due to the artificial interior lighting illuminating the actor, mismatching the natural exterior light of the background – an Age-old problem that some directors don't seem to care about, however seriously it affects the suspension of disbelief. Anyway, enough of my moaning; if you like mindless-action with practically no story other than goodies versus baddies, and if you're a fan of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, you'll love this.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

When you get right down to it, however, they seem to rely mostly on beating each other over the head with whatever is handy.

The plot might seen simple at first, but in reality gives you more than what you asked for. The interactions between the characters are amazing and is the reason why I love these big superhero team films. Loki is one of the best comic book movie villains as he not only gets under the Avengers' skin, but also is able to tear them apart, which leads to internal and external conflicts. Robert Downey Jr is the far the star of the movie as he maintains Iron Man's personality through out the film at a consistent level.

Needless to say, The Avengers is everything you want and more in a superhero blockbuster flick. MARVEL truly put a lot of effort into this movie and it really does show a lot. They not only did a huge team up movie, but they also created one that was deep, compelling and brilliantly done. Every hero we've seen in this movie is given not only a fair amount of time on screen as a group, but each one also individually. We see their struggles with their times as a superhero and each one of them has an arc of their own. Even some of the side characters get their own fair share of screen time and I for one applaud that. The action scenes are beautifully well done in this movie and some of the best I've seen in a superhero flick; especially the final battle. Not only does this movie succeed in also being strong in character development and action, but its humor is also top notch. I burst out laughing at a lot of those funny moments and I think you will too when you see them. There is a lot of eye candy to behold in the movie as well and everything looks brilliant and feels brilliant. I'm not going to go into more of this movie so I don't dare spoil anything for you all, but it has to be said right now. The Avengers is quite possibly the best movie of 2012 I've ever seen.

","I have no idea how Joss Whedon has made this film work. Not only does this work, but this is one of the best superhero films I've ever seen. Surprisingly the script isn't as biased towards Iron Man as I thought it would be and every character gets a good amount of screen time and their chance to shine. Black Widow and Hawkeye more than hold their own and they aren't just in the background whilst the other superheroes dominate the screen and have all the action, Widow and Hawkeye do some unbelievably awesome things, and are crucial to the story. The dialogue is consistently witty and hilarious, every character gets to deliver a good punchline before the film is up. The final battle in Manhattan lasts a good half an hour at least, and I didn't want it to end, the action was of an epic scope and was absolutely jaw dropping. But the real surprise and best part of this film by far is the Hulk. After 2 so- so films they FINALLY got the Hulk right, and dare I say it, he's my favourite avenger after this, and this will probably be the case for most of you when you leave the theatre. This film was action packed, but it wasn't Transformers, this film had heart, intelligent dialogue and a cast of brilliant actors playing conflicting egos and colourful characters. Every actor is spot on in their respective roles, Tom Hiddleston makes for an excellent villain playing Loki, Thor's brother, and Robert Downey Jr. is much better here than he was in Iron Man 2. The only problem I really had with it was that in the middle it dragged on ever so slightly, but this was forgotten by the time the credits rolled. It has to be said though, if you haven't seen any of the Marvel films before this, you won't have any idea what's going on, and you probably won't really care for the film until the last hour or so kicks in.

It was not just put there because the writers thought it would *move the plot along.* It was there because all of these guys have very specific personalities and at times they clashed. Samuel L Jackson was very much in charge, that man is perfect as Nick Fury, it's as if the role was created for him. The exchanges between Captain America and Tony Stark were amusing and at times downright clever. Chris Evens and Robert Downey Jr were perfect. None of the actors hit a wrong note but special kudos to Tom Hiddleston. As Loki he made the film what it was. He was the perfect antagonist. That smile of his was enough to chill, yet the scene between him and the Hulk had the entire theatre roar with laughter. I am not going to go into a real description here as many of the reviews already have but I will say this. The Avengers is one of the best comic book movies to date. It ranks up there with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, V For Vendetta and Watchmen. Thank you Joss Whedon for understanding the medium of comic books and having the vision to be able to bring The Avengers to life. I just hope we see more film like this in the future.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","Joss Whedon is a nerd treasure, after having earned his geek street cred with some of the most iconic TV shows and characters around. My favourite of his creations remains ""Firefly"", an all-around extraordinary show, at the same time my deep dislike for Fox after the cancellation of said show, also remains intact. It was the popularity of the show and the loyalty of the fans which brought Joss Whedon back with his fond and well deserved closing act (?) to the Firefly saga, in the form of the excellent but oft overlooked ""Serenity"". It was through directing ""Serenity"" that Joss Whedon showed that he can easily and comfortably venture beyond TV land and into feature films.

","Pros:
1. The score gives the film a lively and adventurous feel, particularly the vibrant Avengers theme tune.
2. The CGI mostly looks great, and is mixed expertly with the practical effects to keep it grounded.
3. The action scenes are choreographed well and are very entertaining to watch.
4. There is excellent chemistry between all of the actors, especially those playing the avengers.
5. For the most part, the set and costume design is brilliant and they build the world perfectly.
6. The humour produces many laughs, is inserted appropriately, and never outstays its welcome.
7. Robert Downey Jr. (Tony Stark/ Iron Man), Scarlett Johansson (Natasha Romanoff/ Black Widow), Tom Hiddleston (Loki), and Mark Ruffalo (Bruce Banner/ The Hulk) deliver fantastic performances.
8. The character altercations and progressions are handled deftly, as well as concluded nicely.

449,15 September 2012,Ziya90,8," The Dream Team
","The film opens with a spectacular action sequence and you almost understand that the movie will be in epic scale that disappoints or does not, that's another story. Let's talk about the team members first! I know that I am in the minority and sorry, but my favorite Bruce Banner was Eric Bana, it is and it will be, not Edward Norton. In fact, as an actor, I like Edward Norton much more than Eric Bana, but as a character, Bruce Banner, I think that Norton didn't fit the character at all. I mean that it was like I was watching Edward Norton, not Bruce Banner, it was not convincing for me. As for Mark Ruffalo, he was believable as Banner, so better than Norton, but worse than Bana. My only personal problem with Hulk was I couldn't like this ""bad-ass"" Hulk. I know that many of you will surprise when you read that, but I really tried, but I couldn't. It is not important, but also I would prefer my giant to be bigger and taller. Black Widow is, one sentence, she is so hot! Period. Captain America was better in his own movie. He is ""cold"" here. I don't know he was unlikeable in this movie. As action, I can't say that his parts were bad, but it was disappointing. My favorite scene in the whole The First Avenger movie was the shield fight and in this one, there is not any scene in the same level (for Captain America) And I didn't like this new costume either. The conversation between him and the agent in the plane was realistic? or poorly written? You decide. Hawkeye is cool, but before this movie, honestly I didn't know about that character, may be because of that I didn't feel any kind of excitement towards the character. I just ""watched"" him. The Iron Man is The Iron Man you know, so Thor is, but there was a minor problem about Iron Man, he was too powerful in this movie, but really too powerful! Despite the parts take place in the helicarrier feels like Star Trek a little bit, it was great, great action! The main villain of the movie, Loki has some problems as a character. It reminded me Magneto, especially when he ""finds himself"" in a cocktail. It was a pointless scene if you ask me and as a villain, yes he is ""paper-tiger"". He can't be a dominating villain not because of the actor, because of the script. As for one for one fights, Whedon delivers, he doesn't disappoint! Iron Man vs. Thor fight was breathtaking, Hulk vs. Thor fight was great too. Dreams came true... However, ""the battle of words"" between Iron Man and Captain America was insulting for me, it was far fetched. In general the team work works. The very long final climax made the film, despite at times, it reminds you Transformers as many people realized. Yes, the cube, the machines, all these recalls Transformers, but there is the dream team, different type of action, a lot of creative ideas, better direction, better action, you just forget it or you just don't care about it. Some people ask where is the military? Well, I have two answers for that which relieve you I hope: if the military had engaged the enemy, the movie would have been just the copy of Transformers movies and the movie would have been cliché and boring. There were not S.W.A.T. also, that would make the movie cliché and boring too if you ask me. Only The Avengers and the enemy, think like that. As said before, I enjoyed, but didn't like Hulk in this movie. As I seen, most of the audiences loved the ""the punch"" and ""the slamming"" moments, even some people said these were the best moments of the whole film! Sorry, but I disagree. It was just too funny for my taste. I mean those moments ruined the tone of the film for me. Also that fight could have been a serious one, but no problem. It is like I liked this bad-ass Hulk, but also I didn't like. Another thing I disliked about Hulk was he was moving like a monkey at times and that annoyed me. The action, the one-liners, everything else was great!",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","This review will not contain any spoilers. I want those of you who have not seen The Avengers to have the same experience I had when I saw the film. To put any spoilers in this review would be unfair to those who have not seen The Avengers. You probably wouldn't believe me anyway. I went into this film with very high expectations. Something that has never happened to me before happened when I saw The Avengers. The film exceeded my already high expectations. I remember the very end of the first Iron Man when Samuel L Jackson appeared as Nick Fury, then Robert Downey Jr. appeared as Tony Stark At the end of The Incredible Hulk, Samuel L Jackson was back and Nick Fury in Iron Man 2. . At the very he end of Iron Man 2 we saw Thor's hammer. Samuel L Jackson appeared as Nick Fury in Thor. At the end of Thor we saw Capt. America's shield. In Capt. America Samuel L Jackson played Nick Fury connecting all 5 films featuring 4 of the greatest Marvel comics superheroes of all time. Now Tony Stark Iron Man, {Robert Downey Jr.} ,Captain America Steve Rogers {Chris Evans}, Thor {Chris Hemsworth}, and The Hulk and Bruce Banner {Mark Ruffalo} are together in The Avengers. Nick Fury played by {Samuel L Jackson} brings all these superheroes together along with black Widow agent Romanoff {Scarlett Johansson} and Hawkeye {Jeremy Renner.} I'm in agreement with some of the posters who said that The Avengers is the best comic book adaptation ever made. The script was well written. The cast gave master class performances. No one else could have portrayed these characters other than the actors who played them. I was blown away by the special effects in the film. I became a kid all over again watching this The Avengers. This was an excellent movie.

To see if they could work together when we needed them to, to fight the battles that we never could"". - Nick Fury. And producer Kevin Feige brought that idea to life 10 years ago. I remember being excited to watch the movie with my family and everything still holds up. The jokes, the fight scenes, the cast's chemistry and the incredible musical score from Alan Silvestri. It was all crafted beautifully thanks to Joss Whedon's amazing direction and killer script. Even Thanos' cameo still holds up until his scene-stealing performance in ""Infinity War"" and ""Endgame"". It still remains one of the greatest superhero movies of all time and one of the greatest movies ever made period. Just like ""The Dark Knight"" became an influential movie in the superhero genre, ""The Avengers"" is a influential movie on how to make crossovers and team-up stories the right way. Growing up in the 2000's, Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" trilogy, X-Men and The Dark Knight were the superhero movies that had a impact on my childhood but didn't create a lot of buzz because of ""Harry Potter"", ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and ""Twilight"". The 2010's became the gold standard for superhero movies as ""The Avengers"" and later ""Endgame"" broke box office records and the MCU became the new ""Star Wars"".

474,26 April 2012,Absolem,8," Very entertaining. Superhero ensemble done right.
","Over the past five years we have been exposed to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which has introduced us to a multitude of characters. Finally, it all comes to a head in this massive ensemble. Following the arrival of the Norse God Loki (Tom Hiddleston), S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) assembles a team of six of the most powerful individuals the world has ever seen to combat the threat. However, their egos and suspicions of one another create a lot of friction in the group. Many feared that the screen time of this film would be dominated by a single character, with the rest simply playing supporting roles. They needn't have worried, as each Avenger is given an appropriate amount of attention. Returning to their roles from the previous Marvel films are Robert Downey Jr. as the pretentious yet well-meaning industrialist Tony Stark/Iron Man, Chris Evans as the recently resurrected World War II hero Steve Rogers/Captain America, Chris Hemsworth as Norse God Thor (Loki's stepbrother) and Scarlett Johansson as enigmatic spy Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Jeremy Renner expands upon his brief cameo in ""Thor"" as Clint Barton/Hawkeye, by far the most interesting member of the group. Replacing Edward Norton as Bruce Banner/The Hulk is Mark Ruffalo, who fills the role surprisingly well. Badass as usual is Jackson as Fury. We also see quite a lot of fan favorite Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg), who makes his most memorable appearance so far. Returning in supporting roles are Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Dr. Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard). Introduced in this film is Agent Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders), who doesn't really get enough screen time to make a proper impression. While the entire cast is solid, the best performance by far is by Hiddleston. As the film's primary villain, he cuts an imposing figure, peering a death glare at the audience and relishing every word as he attempts to get inside the heroes' heads. Director Joss Whedon, the man behind ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" and ""Firefly"", once again shows his ability to create a well-made ensemble piece. Following in the footsteps of Jon Favreau, Kenneth Branagh, Louis Letterier and Joe Johnston, he was the ideal choice for this film. Whedon was able to cover all of the necessary areas, from the emotional impact of the death of a major character, to the film's many moments of humor and the many heart-racing action scenes. Another triumph is the film's special effects. The motion capture used to create the Hulk has made him look more realistic than any previous live-action portrayal, Loki's army of Chitauri aliens are a convincing force to be reckoned with and vehicles are created that could never exist in reality. Furthermore, Whedon alumni Alexis Denisof is unrecognizable as The Other, a mysterious villain who hints at what is going on behind the scenes (and what will come to the front in future installments). While it won't win any Oscars, The Avengers succeeds in all of the intended areas. A character-driven story with heart, action and humor, it brings these iconic characters to the big screen in a way that does them justice, and will thrill audiences from beginning to end.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

That's where most action films are lacking. Avengers has got genuine wit. Great subtext and character development. Dialogue. Deft banter. The way the relationships build is convincing and unforced. Plenty of camp, but well balanced and never becomes mockery. And the action is perfect. So many action films try to dazzle so much you can't tell what's going on. The Avengers goes totally ballistic in the concluding battle, but you can always tell exactly what's happening on screen. I am not going to go deep. I'll leave that to the pros, and there are already plenty of positive reviews. I just wanted to say that this is one of those rare big-budget action films that lives up to the hype. Major winner.

Chris Evans,Chris Hemsworth,Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner are impressive..but the biggest surprise is Mark Rufallo as the Dr.Bruce Banner a.k.a the Hulk(""the other guy"")..he Delivers probably the best scenes in the movie and oh boy he steals the show big time..!! never enjoyed anything on big screen as him(The Hulk)..coming to the others Tom Hiddleston is good as a much formidable opponent to the group of superheroes, slimy and evil in equal measure.

","No other movie has done a better job combining different main characters with different ongoing storylines. The Justice League got nowhere close (even the overrated but better than original Snyder Cut), not Jurassic World Dominion, not Star Wars (the sequels which are also very bad). The only piece of fiction that I would argue that did as good of a job combining characters is Game of Thrones. This movie also set the standard for invasions and cgi fights. I kept you invested and was pure fun to watch. When Hulk stops the giant alien worm and the 6 unit in a pan around shot complimented by the legendary music every audience member goes nuts and you are left with goosebumps. This same music is played during the Thor Wakanda entrance and portal scene from Endgame. Point being that this theme is used only for the most epic music. This is a top 20 scene in fiction and one that would shape history in film. Before this, comic superhero movies weren't all that popular. This is when, as a young kid, I became hooked and am still now with the MCU. Very disgusted to see how bad Phase 4 is turning out to be. Iron Man and Hulk carry this movie with Samuel Jackson's Nick Fury and Black Widow adding strong support. I will say this was a weaker movie for Thor and Captain American and his awful costume. Nick Fury and Black Widow do a great job of tying all the main characters together and introduce the audience to SHIELD. Every scene on the Helli carrier was worth watching. I loved how randomly Tony pointed out the Galaga player and the team's argument. Hulk is terrifying, which he should be, and we get see him on both sides. His fight with Thor was short but epic. Loki is an amazing villain to go up against everyone. Hiddleston gives a great performance with little. It makes sense why they didn't kill him off in this one. The death in the movie was sad but necessary to provide some stakes. The end invasion was kept simple enough to show off every character. And it ended in a unique way. Captain America vs Iron man is a great concept and started in this movie. They make for great allies and rivals. Black Widow, Bruce, Iron Man, and Captain America's opening scenes were all good. This is the only movie in which I have liked Ruffalo as Bruce. I will say he did great in this one. I don't care about the comedian in the other movies.

But it is a fantastic summer action movie with some of the greatest comic book action we've gotten so far in film and, when you really think about a movie with the scope of THE AVENGERS, this movie could've failed in so many ways. But it didn't. It amazed. It was beyond fun. It was an excellent finale to what Marvel has come to refer to as ""Phase I"", which means we can expect to see more story lines and characters overlapping in Marvel Cinematic Universe and it's made me so freakin' excited to see what the future holds for Marvel's film franchises. The movie begins as we see S.H.I.E.L.D. in possession of the Tesseract from CAPTAIN America, experimenting in the possibility of unlimited clean energy. Unfortunately, the Tesseract has attracted the attention of Loki and whatever dark forces he's bargained with. Loki has plans on using the Tesseract to open a portal to another dimension and bring war to Earth with aspirations of enslaving the human race. Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. are in over their heads but, thankfully, the past year has introduced a series of superheroes that might come in handy in just such a scenario: Iron Man, the Hulk, Thor, and Captain America.

You have to suspend any logic or common sense to be entertained. If you can, this movie will keep you occupied for over 2 hours. Don't be tempted to make sense out of the story because it leads to questions that invite logic and common sense. The comics can get away with so much because in that world, it comes across as that is what happens in that world. Trying to transfer comics to the screen becomes challenging because trying to bring a super hero to reality is not easy. So we settle for the next best thing which is to make it entertaining. The director pulls that off quite well. In the end, you want to ask your self if you got your monies or tickets worth. The answer is yes. This is not a movie that invites you to come back and see it again. There are no memorable scenes which is its only flaw all things considered.

","Avengers Assemble is the best superhero film ever made. I thought it was better than The Dark Knight and as soon as it started, I felt like seeing Harry Potter all over again at the cinema.

509,29 April 2012,bendi_in_luv,9," Loki for an Academy Award please
","I read a few of the other reviews, and while some mention the incredible performance Loki gives, none capture the true brilliance. I expect Tom Hidelston to win an Academy Award for his role in this story. Loki is not evil. Not purely sickeningly evil. Heath Ledger takes top honors for that portrayal as the Joker. Loki is different. He has goals, motives, desires, and pride. He is above all else mischievous, cunning, and calculating, as he attempts to and temporarily succeeds in turning the world's greatest heroes against each other. He truly delivers one of if not the best performance of the movie, and in particular shines a little after an hour into the movie, when Black Widow confronts him on the carrier: ""Your ledger is dripping, its gushing red, and you think saving a man no less virtuous than yourself will change anything? This is the basest sentimentality. This is a child at prayer— pathetic. You lie and kill in the service of liars and killers. You pretend to be separate, to have your own code, something that makes up for the horrors; but they are a part of you, and they will never go away. "" All other main characters give stellar performances as well. The Samuel Jackson (an actor I usually despise) brings back all the greatness of Pulp Fiction, except this time bald and with an eye patch. Captain America dominates every moral issue, and though one of the weakest of the team, is the greatest unifier and leader among them. Thor brings back the elegance and civility of a bygone age, combining with Iron Man's sarcasm and cocky swagger in just the right ways to leave everyone grinning. And Bruce Banner finally gets a chance to shine as a brilliant yet conflicted man more than as a raging green beast. Even Black Widow and Agent Caulson have their moments. The only slightly disappointing acting was by Hawkeye, but most of the time he's not fighting, he's brainwashed, so you expect him to be acting a little strangely anyways. And the ACTION. Incredible. Once the final battle starts, there is no letting up. It is brilliant flash after brilliant flash, punch by punch, hit by deafening, glorious, hit. It never lets up, and it is almost impossible not to cry out in excitement. I felt like a little kid all over again. Each team member gets their cameo time fighting off hordes against all odds, and then comes scene after scene of team work. At one point, you follow Iron Man as he blazes a trail, literally, through the oncoming horde, pausing briefly to help each hero as he rushes by. Captain America leads the ground assault, Thor dominates the skies, and Hulk smashes with such agile speed and deadly efficiency you are left squirming in your seat. I am an action junkie, and while I found the opening salvos somewhat dull, especially the car chase, I loved every mini hero battle and almost cried in delight through out the finale. The only Marvell movie I think that stands up to The Avengers as best comic based movie is Woverine: Origins. While Avengers did have better and more exciting action, including the finale, Origins had a more heart wrenching and slightly better told story. The end of Origins, when Wolverine's love dies in his arms, I have a hard time not choking up. That gut wrenching, heart tearing, happy-and-dying-inside-all-at-the-same-time feeling, that make movies like Spartacus and Romeo and Juliet so great, that helped make Origins great, never once came to me in Avengeres. For that reason, I think Avengers did not appeal to me as much as it could have. I just did not feel it inside like I have other stories. Overall, an excellent movie. It started a little slow for me, probably because I was so anxious to see the heroes fighting an alien army. And while I did find the movie very funny at times, I think the trailer kind of ruined it for me: there were lines I remembered loving from the trailers that, in context, were much more serious, and hearing all the laughing in the theater, even though they were lines I laughed at when I watched the trailers, seemed somewhat inappropriate. I rarely give out 10 stars, but I'm still riding the adrenaline from the finale, even without which, I'm not sure I'd lower my score to a 9. Out of 100, this movie definitely scores somewhere in the 90's.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","This is one of the films me and my friends were dying to see this year (the others are Prometheus, The dark knight returns, The hobbit). When it came to the theater I was completely out of my mind. Finally we bought the tickets and the show was about to start. The idea of making movies about comic-book heroes one by one and then mixing them all in one film is a genius idea (economically and sociologically). Iron man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America were great movies but this was beyond great. This is what a comic book hero film should be. 1) The acting. All of the actors are so comfortable and relaxed that one has the feeling they truly ARE those characters. Most of them are Oscar nominees, some of them Oscar winners. Mark Ruffalo is the best Bruce Banner (hats of to Norton but he was not Banner), and he gives the best dramatic performance in the movie. Robert Downey Jr. is, I believe, no longer acting, he is Tony Stark. Cris Hemsworth, I had the feeling, never really stopped playing Thor and gave the exact same performance as in his own movie. The greatest surprise was Jeremy Renner. He was mind blowing as Hawkeye. He got the very essence of how Stan Lee imagined him. Scarlett Johansson gave a slightly different role that in Iron man 2 (probably because she had a bigger and more important role here) but it worked just fine. The only one that was a little off track was Captain America. A young actor such as Chris Evans just couldn't break through on the screen with all the other strong characters. And of course, the almighty Samuel L. Jackson is the master, the student and the God as Nick Fury. It's really a shame he had so little screen time as he did. 2) The story. An amazing idea of creating a super villain that uses an alien army to conquer Earth is something new, a fresh idea. The fact that it was Loki (another great performance) makes the idea even better (because of the relationship with Thor). The movie is divided in three parts, and the first and third are the best. The problem is the second part of the movie that was a little too long. 144 min. is a bit to long. Everything that was said could have been said in 15 min time less. The end battle is so nerve-breaking that I literally had no more nails to bite off! Quite a long story that concentrated 2/3 of the movie on the heroes themselves is great, because every story that deals with people (heroes or not) is a good one. 3) The music. Alan Silvestry can do a good job, but here he did a little less good. In my opinion some sequences should have had better musical backgrounds. The only sequence that the music fitted perfectly was the very end of the movie. All in all, a MARVELous movie, with magnificent performances, a great story with many layers of emotion, humor, drama and psychology. If you haven't seen any other movie of these heroes you might have a problem understanding who is who, and the relationships between them, but in the end you get it all (and that is a sign of a great script). Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best superhero movie ever made!",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

The entire plot is a lot of nice computer animations covering over a veritable train wreck of predictable - yet quite often inexplicable - events, actions, and cheesy comments. And the cast is eminent - if celebrity and not exercised talent is the 2012 definition of eminence. A Danish movie director who has had fair success in Hollywood was once asked what it took artistically to make a blockbuster movie. His answer: ""Understand that the average viewer is male, 12 years old, and moderately gifted. And understand that there has to be something good, something bad, something awesome, and something pretty. The rest is less significant."" Well, this movie has it all, here are some examples of the stereotypes: Heroes=good. Aliens=bad. Fighting=awesome. Scarlett=pretty. If you don't want to spend an hour and a half getting stupider, go watch 3 episodes of Friends, The King of Queens, or something else which is at least mediocre.

In the case of The Hulk it really doesn't matter. So newcomers are welcome but some familiarity with Thor may be of preference although personally I didn't have it. In terms of the development it seemed as though there was an inevitability that some would get the upper hand. Namely Iron Man, Captain America and Thor with some coming for the Hulk.

To accomplish this momentous task, Marvel brought in Joss Whedon(Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Firefly, Serenity) to both co-write and direct this film of sky high expectations. Whedon, whom has proved himself to be excellent with ensemble casts, has not directed a theatrical film since 2005′s Serinity which may have left fans scratching their heads when he was announced. On top of the wildcard director, the film also has to bring in all of the stars from the past Marvel Cinematic Universe films into one movie without taking away from the other casts members.

","What can I say about the Avengers that everyone else hasn't already said? Well, believe the hype! it's great! why? well numerous reasons. One of them is the director they chose for the job of bringing one of the most iconic super teams in comics to life.Joss Whedon has showed time and time again that he knows about both the Marvel Universe (see his run on Astonishing X-men) and Team dynamics(See Firefly or any of his other works)and he works his magic to the max here. another reason is the great cast. while all good, two performances really stand out to me. The first one is Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk and the second one is Tom Hiddleston as Loki. While I enjoyed Ed Norton's Banner, I felt something was missing from him, Likability. Mark Ruffalo had Likability. Tom Hiddleston's Loki was a great villain that really had that sinister aura about him and he's better here than he was in Thor. Another Reason is the action. Not only does the final scene have An epic battle that rivals Robots trashing Chicago in Transformers 3 (This is way cooler) But other great action scenes come throughout the movie. one of my favorites is the scene at the beginning where Loki steals the Tesseract/Cosmic Cube and takes down a whole bunch of S.H.I.E.L.D agents including Nick Fury and Hawkeye. Also, The plot is fairly simplistic but what really makes this movie shone is the character dynamics. So final verdict: possibly the best movie of the summer of 2012.

","The Avengers is a fan's dream come true. Five years fives films and the most incredible build up in film history leading to this the most ambition filled film ever. It could've fallen flat on it's face. But the film makers who made it clearly love the heroes involved and wanted to show it in terms of story and character development. Joss Whedon takes his time in letting the film unwind and he let's action show up when it's needed. The Action stunts and CGI all take a backseat to the story and acting which is great. Whedon lets the characters speak for themselves and let's the story develop at it's own pace. Which is important because all of that leads to the incredible action packed climax. The interaction between the heroes shows them bonding and feeling each other out as well as rising to the menace which leads to the formation of the Avengers. The story ties up dangling plot lines from the other Marvel films and comes up with a plot that demands the Avengers. S.H.I.E.L.D is experimenting with the tesseract a cube of awesome power when Loki Thor's half brother enters our world and after a battle with Nick Fury and his forces Loki takes the tesseract and leaves taking with him some converts. His plan is to use the Tesseract to open a gateway to let a hostile alien force invade Earth and once Earth is taken down he will step in and Rule it. Nick Fury quickly puts the Avengers plan into action and calls forth Captain America,Iron Man,The Black Widow,Thor, And The Hulk to help find Loki and to battle whatever Evil he is about to unleash. Some bumpy moments happen along the way until they finally form as a team with Hawkeye lending a hand. If You're a comic book fan this is a supreme moment of triumph for you.

Then what, he came to earth and got that cube from Nick Fury (Director of S.H.I.E.L.D). Then as usual Nick Fury wants that cube because it will destroy the earth. So he has to assemble the super heroes, because Loki has the alien's army. Rest of the story we all know. I told about the response from the theater for the Avengers movie. From the six super heroes (Iron man- Robert Downey Jr, HULK- Mark Ruffalo, CA- Chris Evans, Thor- Chirs Hemsworth, Black Widow- Scarlett Johansson, Hawkeye- Jeremy Renner, Loki- Tom Hiddleston and Nick Fury- Samuel L Jackson) initially Ironman got the number fans but the end of the film some of them were changed to HULK not me .

""The Avengers"" is the movie that comic-book fans, as well as the entire world, have been awaiting for a long time. Take me, for example. I'm one of a handful of people from my generation who has never read a comic book. So I know nothing about how this movie, or the films that predated it, follow their source material. I saw this film with a crowd of folks, many of whom undoubtedly were familiar with the comics, and I think I cherished it just as much as they did. It is one tremendously smashing movie; one not to be missed! I need not report that the film brings together the heroes of recent Hollywood extravaganzas. What I do need to report is just how seamlessly and smoothly that transition is. The movie brings together the characters of the ""Iron Man"" movies, ""Captain America: the First Avenger,"" ""Thor,"" and the ""Hulk"" pictures while paying idiosyncratic respect to each of their characteristics and personalities. None overshadows or takes away from the other. Hard to imagine, since it features Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), one of the biggest egotists in recent movie history. Yet he does not steal the show from the mostly personality-free Captain 'America' Rogers (Chris Evans). The same applies to the ""in-between characters"" such as Nick Fury (an eye patch-toting Samuel L.

","The Avengers became a big success at the box office but, in reality, it's not that great. It's a fine film, with a lot of action. In the end, however, it's a passable Hollywood product. The plot is something that only a comic book reader will enjoy or fully understand, and it's there only to show several different and iconic superheroes working together. The actors do a fine job but, for me, there were no standout performances. Perhaps the only one who stood out was Chris Evans as Captain America because he was righteous, old-fashioned, and he wasn't sarcastic. And this brings me to the script by Joss Whedon, which is quite poor. I guess it wasn't easy to write a good screenplay in which each superhero has to seem relevant. This is the biggest reason why the script fails to surprise. For example, Robert Downey Jr. is his usual self as Iron Man but there's nothing that stands out in his performance. He had a lot more to work with in Iron Man (2008), and there was plenty more drama there too. The script is rather predictable, and the characters don't come off well because they have nothing important to say. The main villain Loki is also a letdown. I like Tom Hiddleston but his character has little to do except walk, talk and look menacing. Add to this a horde of enemies about whom we know almost nothing and we have one rather boring second half of the film. The heroes fight the enemies like they're shooting cans at target practice. They employ their skills, and it's all quite dull because there are too many weak and faceless enemies. The final battle reminded me a lot of Transformers (2007). Joss Whedon does a good job as director, but The Avengers is still a by the numbers action summer blockbuster. Yes, the special effects are impressive in places. Other than that there's nothing here to get excited about. Films like Iron Man (2008), Thor (2011) and The Incredible Hulk (2008) had more to like than this film. The addition of silly and predictable humor only makes the film seem more forgettable.

","Big, bombastic comic book movie about a bunch of Marvel Comics characters teaming up to defeat alien invaders. Four of the original Avengers are joined by two other Marvel heroes, Hawkeye (Renner) and Black Widow (Johanssen). For the most part, all are properly costumed (unlike X-MEN) and fit their roles admirably. Hulk continues to stand out like a sore thumb as he remains strictly a CGI creation, but mercifully we see little of him until well into the second half. The actor playing the hunted, tortured Bruce Banner (Ruffalo) easily turns in the film's strongest performance.The two additions to the original roster, the Widow and Hawkeye,are without superpowers, but are just as effective when push comes to shove. Director Whedon of SERENITY fame paces the film extremely well, so that we're not overdosed with video game-like CGI until the big finale. There's plenty of character development for a two-hour comic book movie. There's also plenty of humor, and the punchlines come and go faster than Thor (Hemsworth) can twirl his hammer. The film also boasts a villain worthy of the gang: Thor's half-brother Loki (Hiddleston). That actor has by far the silliest lines to deliver, mainly to do with he conquest of Earth and the subjugation of the human race, yet manages to make them sound convincing enough. He also knows when to play it for laughs courtesy of Whedon's sharp direction. While Downey as Iron Man may be out-acted by Ruffalo, his character is the glue that binds, even though Capt. America (Evans) is the Avengers' leader. Without Downey's quirky Tony Stark, there would be no AVENGERS movie. Sam Jackson makes his third film appearance as Nick Fury, agent of SHIELD, although I'm not clear on why he was dressed for a MATRIX movie. AVENGERS is worth a look, even if you're not a comic book fan. You can always skip the big battle at the end, which is straight out of a video game. Funny thing: Whedon reveals the villain who will appear in the sequel, following the credits. This villain makes Loki look like a circus clown.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","In a late scene Hulk beats the daylight out of the one credible super-villain in the film - Loki - and you realize having a team of superheroes - even one that spends a lot of time bickering - does tend to unbalance the scales of justice to the home team. The superheroes also include an indestructible beast - the aforementioned Hulk - and an immortal god - Thor. Like the old Jerry Seinfeld line about Superman - ""why would he needs the rest of the Superfriends - he's Superman!"" Why do you need, for example, Hawkeye - essentially Katniss Everdeen with piercing blue eyes - or Black Widow whose superpower seems to be looking good in leather? This leaves Robert Downey, Jr.'s Ironman who, by contractual arrangement with the $25M a picture actor gets all the good lines. Two in particular, when he calls out an extra for playing Galaga and refers to Thor as ""Point Break"" are instant film classics. Unfortunately, Whedon, like the rest of us, is slave to RDJ's ego so he's left to give just dull exposition dialog to the boring and largely obsolete Captain America (""there's only one God and I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that"") and one-note Samuel L. Jackson (""hey you guys, we need to fight back!""). Having said all that, although a little talky, the film presents expensive-looking prolonged and noisy CGI action sequences which distract, if not entertain. The movie understands its nerdy male audience by lingering on the backsides of the female characters whenever they exit the shot for a meaningful but not creepy length of time (Gweneth Paltrow runs with this trope by only achieving ambulatory movement by strutting at all times). An excellent cast (actor's fees only must have hit the $100M mark) also contributes to a worthwhile outing.

There are times when the film is too thick with exposition, but the characters and the actors are all so good that it rarely drags (there's one long sequence where a bunch of characters are fighting amongst themselves that I thought felt a tad forced).

I saw this on a plane several years ago. I've seen several others in the genre. In this film--they all seem to be like this--the heroes are battling to save the world. Sometimes, they battle to save the galaxy, or even the universe. In this film, the plot setup is so ridiculous, I can't take any of it even halfway seriously. But the genre fans are pleased, because it delivers the one supreme thing they care most about: beings with super-powers fighting each other. Much of this very over-long movie consists of characters battling, flying around, running around, more fighting, etc., etc. My reaction: giant yawn! What a bore! See, before these kinds of movies--say, before Star Wars, as a point of reference--most movies were not focused on battle scenes, explosions, fate of worlds, etc. They were about characters and human (not alien, etc.) beings. Action scenes, even in action films, did not take up most of the screen time. Now there have been so many of these films, they all seem alike. It's way beyond saturation. So, if you are entertained by lots of fighting using special effects, you may well like this. Otherwise, don't waste your time.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","The Avengers is what we all dream about on reading those superhero comics and watching the movies. We always would love the concept of having all superheroes assembled and fighting for justice and that if such a thing happens, nothing ever could happen to our planet Earth. However, rational thinking would suggest putting them all in one basket would make movie making quite difficult since the logistics of bringing an all conquering villain along with the bonding of the superheroes would change the dynamic of the superhero movie concept and can be a double edged sword if not handled properly. Certainly they cannot make a movie where the heroes are summoned to fight evil and they come and finish the job and they leave.

","I would like to preface any comments i have regarding this movie with a confession, i never thought The Avengers Assemble would ever happen. Even when Marvel started to weave the characters and films together (rather cock handedly i thought) i still felt it would be a step too far. The main problem (or so i thought) would be to balance the characters and actors. Indeed, the very thought of Robert Downey Jnr, Edward Norton (replaced here by the excellent Mark Ruffalo), Chris Evans and Samuel L Jackson in the same film is enough to melt even the hardened film fans little heart. This perceived problem is definitely the films major strength, the way Joss Whedon (finally getting his props) allows each character their space to shine whilst adhering to the 'confines' of the super group is exemplary. None of the team are ever neglected, no matter how varied or relative their strengths seem to be. The obvious odd men out here, Hawkeye and Black Widow, get just as much screen time both kicking ass and burping exposition as Stark or Banner do. Its this care and attention that gives the movie its weight, that even when we are watching a 20 minute slew of explosions and flying kicks, we are still pondering the fragile dynamics of the group.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012
651,26 November 2012,mherriman32,9," The Avengers
","The Marvel's movie The Avengers is an action packed comedy sci-fi movie all in one. It has everything and everyone in it. All of the Marvel characters in one brought together by Nick Fury because Loki stole the Tesseract that was found in the Captain America movie. It has Thor, Hulk, Iron Man, Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Captain America. All the characters are extremely different, which made it very difficult for them to come together as one team against their other worldly foe, Loki. It takes the super heroes to get past their own egos and accept each other's help. It's difficult for the characters to come together because they're personalities are all so different, and they're also used to being the stars by themselves so that makes ten times more difficult to come together. There is a lot of inner conflict with the characters too. To start off with, the inevitable Iron Man. He is still the same Iron Man, a genius with a lot of money and a huge ego. Captain America just has came back from being frozen since the World War II times. He isn't used to all the technology that is used to really enhance the movie. That causes a conflict because Iron Man refers to Captain America as an ""old man"". Then there's Thor who is Loki's brother, there's more conflict. He comes to help because he is against his brothers antics. Loki believes that a world shouldn't have freedom like ours does. He comes to be the ruler and demands it. Then there's Natasha or the Black Widow, to me the typical woman in a super hero movie. She's almost seductive. They have her in tight clothing and she's manipulative. I am surprised that she can hold her own. I figured they would have made her more of a damsel in distress because she is the only woman in the movie really. Her friend Hawkeye becomes under Loki's spell trying to defend Loki from getting the Tesseract. He ends up having to fight Natasha and then comes out of the spell the help in the end. Then there's Hulk who has been trying to hide and stay away pretty much from people so he can keep calm. He hates becoming the Hulk, but when he does, he doesn't care who or what is in his way. He fights the other characters and tries to hurt them without really being aware.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

Now I am not downing this movie since it's not as entertaining as the first time seeing it. But you just notice some weaknesses. Now when it comes to the plot there really isn't anything all that original. A certain team needs to get their act together and not quarrel, bicker and fight amongst each other. In order to fight and win against a battle or a game when the odds are against them. Seem familiar? Because it has been done countless times. But the execution is the most important thing and the execution for the movie is well done and entertaining most of the way through. The final fight at the end is worth the price of admission. However when it comes to the plot there really isn't anything special that makes it stand out. The plot and editing in ""John Carter"" in my opinion is more well done than this in my opinion. But unfortunately ""John Carter"" didn't do so well at all when compared to this movie. Now Josh Whedon did a pretty good job when it comes to the Marvel characters portrayed in this movie and stuck pretty close to the comic book materials. But in the comics although the characters are arrogant there are other elements that turns it away from it being the main focus. For this movie arrogance is the main part of what the characters face and is one of the biggest obstacle in their path. What ""The Avengers"" do is constantly have a penis measuring competition with each other when the world is at stake. Anyways the fighting and action sequences are really entertaining and cool to watch. Some scenes are like superhero smackdown battles so those scenes were entertaining as well, despite it all happening over arrogance and pride.

Yes the superheroes are all pretty cool but that's why they each have their own film. I feel that having all of them there didn't really allow for any development of the characters who all seemed to be competing for screen time. It was fairly unoriginal considering the films out there, an invading alien army comes to take over the world (by which I mean an alien army comes and invades America; the only place aliens ever seem to attack). I feel they tried to fit so much in that the story in general was entertaining but also seemed a bit rushed and not very original, as far as I could see it was something straight out of Hollywood. 2.5/5",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","The culmination of Marvel's four-year, five-picture master plan is, puzzlingly, both as good as I'd hoped and a mild disappointment. It excels at playing up the larger-than-life aspects of the story, from the testy initial relationship between heroes and the looming magnitude of the threat they're called together to face. Such moments are dispersed liberally, perhaps once every five minutes, and they're an effective method of keeping the audience on the hook for the duration. What's missing, at least from where I sit, is a measure of substance or depth behind those fireworks. Robert Downey Jr. is again excellent in his nuanced interpretation of the paradoxical Tony Stark, and Mark Ruffalo might just be the best Hulk to grace the silver screen, but by comparison the rest of the cast feels quite thin, shallow and (for lack of a better word) cartoonish. Captain America, for example, wears a completely different personality than he did in his solo picture, and never feels quite right as the commanding field general he's presented to be. The most intriguing aspect of his character, an emotional detachment from modern culture, is barely even mentioned. He, and the rest of the team, feels like a suit of armor with a few good one-liners, not a living, breathing human being. It's a trap that was mostly evaded in the stars' preceding solo shots, so it's a shame to see it tripped here, especially given the amount of time and effort that was expended to define each individual's motivations. Those nitpicks certainly aren't enough to stop me from enjoying the closest thing we'll ever get to an all-splash-page crossover mega-event on the big screen, but they're also irritating enough to keep tickling the back of my mind while the next set of fuses are lit. It's a herculean effort with some truly great rewards, but not the picture-perfect ensemble masterpiece it would have you believe.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","I cannot believe The Avengers has received such stellar reviews. By 1/3 the way into the film, none of the characters draw one in, the story is uncompelling and I find myself only waiting in boredom for the next fight scenes which turn out to be formulaic and insufficient to warrant further viewing. The designs for various scenes and characters also fail. They look plastic and cheap and distracting from the story rather than immersive. Save your time and money and skip this title. Evidently these reviews have a minimum line count which is equivalent to paying by the word. So let me be verbose. This film was not even fun to watch the villains tearing apart the world because they look so silly in their costumes, their character building moments are horribly predictable and shallow, and what is up with the designs for Loki? He looks more samurai than Scandinavian god, which I am sure is a tip of the hat to the samurai influence in comic books, but let's get real for a moment. He's a bloody Norse god. He should look Norse. If he's going to look so radically different from Norse mythology -- all cybernetic-anime -- then there needs to be some kind of story and character building to explain it.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","I just saw The Avengers movie and still don't know what to say about it.Its Funny that real everyday people write real reviews on this moviesite and the next entries placed above the reviews are from fake accounts giving this movie 8 or 10 stars,real talk.This is a 5 star movie.Its good but not great. The Avengers is first of all- Not the best movie ever made nor is The Avengers better than The Dark Knight or even Spiderman 2. If someone tells you different , they may have the mind of a five year old. The action is good and the characters all play their roles great, but something is missing in this movie.If the main villain Loki and his crew of aliens became a threat to any city in the U.S. I would laugh and take my chances. Am I the only one wondering where were the U.S.Airforce ,Marines,Army or even the Navy,when a whole entire city is being attacked ? Who were the aliens shooting at when they came from outerspace ? They sure wasn't hitting the people running around in the middle of the street during the entire battle scene.Did any hardworking bank employee,cop,or other random person running in the street get hurt? I didn't see any. Bad writing and action sequences ruined this movie. I was also wondering,couldn't Thor just electrocute most of the aliens for about 30 mins instead of fighting them one on one? He can control lighting. I would still say this movie is entertaining but watched by fans and viewers with common sense , this movie is a comedy and very very very overrated.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","It has been a long time that I had to wait in line to buy a ticket and then wait in line again to get a good seat. The Avengers was well worth the wait. Director Joss Whedon definitely got it right with this film. Although the film was nearly two and a half hours long it did not feel like it because the momentum of the story flowed so well. As you can tell by the trailer, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has returned to take over the earth and is met by a cast of superheroes assembled by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). All of the main characters were true to form. Iron Man / Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) was exactly like you would expect him to be; arrogant, smart and playful. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) follows his so called brother Loki to earth and the tension between them has not changed from the last time that these two hit the big screen. The Hulk / Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) somehow manages to somewhat tame his beast and join the party. Captain America / Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) has the daunting task of trying to catch up with time while forming a relationship with his new found comrades. I found him to be the most endearing of the heroes because he had so much catching up to do since he was thawed out. The two heroes that did not have their own introduction prior to this film were Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye / Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner), although I think that a prequel could possibly work because I think that there is definitely some history there. I have to say that I was not expecting this film to have the level of comedy that it did. I think that the whole audience was caught a little off guard (myself included). Everything about this film was excellent; the acting, the special effects, the character development, the script I could go on and on. I am almost certain that this is not the last time that we see The Avengers. I smell the beginning of many more sequels in the future and I will once again stand in that long line to go and see them. This is not the time to be frugal. Dig in your pockets and go and see this film at the IMAX in 3D. I am giving this film a glaring green light.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

The plot is getting quite confusing too, as things have to get in progress in order for the final battle to happen.

763,10 May 2012,tomb_92,8," Essentially a dumb, loud, explosive action film, but a dumb, loud explosive action film done well.
","I had my reservations about Avenger Assemble for a long time- it is not my sort of film. The only previous films in the saga I saw before this were Iron Man (which I didn't like) and Captain America (which I did). What made Captain America for me was that it was interesting that is was set against the backdrop of world war II, and the redeeming feature of Iron Man was the witty dialogue between Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow. So the task is, how do they make a film with all of these stars, with so much back-story, set in the modern era, without it turning into Iron Man 2.5 (which it does in places), that lives up to the MASSIVE hype? Let's face it, since the film has been building up people's expectations for that long and with so many huge stars competing for screen time and the best dialogue it was never going to be anything but a little bit of a mess. What it is though is an enjoyable mess. They don't go down the route of the Transformers films (Revenge of the Fallen in particular) and just spend 2 hours making 2 dimensional robot characters smash each other up. Avengers Assamble is enjoyable because of the characters involved. It is to its advantage that the back-stories for most of the main characters have been established already, it means that we can just get on with the film and not spend to much time discussing the wherefores and the hows. It is also good that despite having only seen 2 of the previous 5 films I was able to understand perfectly well what was going on the film. The story is very simple and not at all confusing (unlike Transformers ROTF) and requires very little thinking. If you do take anytime to actually think about the film it is clearly just a ""slot A into tab B"" affair- very predictable and formulaic- but if you take it for what it is and enjoy the ride it is very entertaining. It is the characters that make the film. Unlike the Transformers films the characters are all unique and well rounded. They all seem to have their own part to play (apart from Black Widow, who aside from looking good and being the token female seems to have nothing to do and no real superpowers). It does turn a little into Iron Man 2.5 at times, after all it is clear he has the best powers and Robert Downey Jr. is the biggest star so it is hard not too. Some of his lines do get a little less witty and a little more silly at times but it is never really too much of a problem. Each character does have their part to play and it was interesting watching their interplay on screen. The film as a whole was nothing more than a formulaic affair, going from confrontation to confrontation without much to link it together, but this is not really a problem. It relies heavily on special effects, which is OK since they work well in the context of the film. The final huge CGI fest that was the end battle was done very well, with each character getting a similar amount to do (with the exception of Black Widow) and it was consistently interesting (unlike the climaxes of the Transformers films which were just dumb smash 'em up's for an hour). I do take issue with one thing though- a tiny amount of CGI in the climax battle was quite poor (Scarlett Johansson flying on the hover-bike thing)- almost unforgivable in a film that relies to heavily on special effects and which has such a big budget. The actors do a great job, for me Mark Ruffalo stealing the show with his unhinged, unstable Banner, though Tom Hiddleston was great too. It is this that makes the film so watchable. Without such interesting characters the film would just be a big dumb mess. In the end the film is nothing more than formulaic but a very well done formulaic film. The director Whedon clearly knew exactly what he was doing at every scene of the film. I think it is very commendable that with the amount of hype surrounding the film and the number of stars competing in the film that he has formed anything other than a complete mess. When it comes down to it Avengers Assemble is an enjoyable film, made so by the characters and the actors portraying them. It is very funny at times and surprisingly never boring. It's not particularly clever but it know's how to appeal to a wide audience and fans alike and it is an achievement.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","""The Avengers"" is an okay superhero movie; that's it. A great deal of the problem is that there are too many characters at once. The viewer doesn't get any time to understand most of the characters' backstories or motivations. They are suddenly called up for duty to defend the earth against the scrawny and mysterious alien supervillain based off of a Norse god. Most of the superheroes were not interesting, as their personalities were not that well-developed. The exception to this is Iron Man, who is wonderfully played by Robert Downey, Jr. Iron Man is depicted as a wealthy sarcastic playboy who isn't necessarily a hero for altruistic reasons. The smarminess and smugness of Iron Man's character may turn a lot of people off; but hey, at least it's a ""character"". There are a few scenes where the Hulk is really funny, but that is only as the Hulk persona, rather than as Bruce Banner. The rest of the superheroes are bland and undeveloped as characters. The film is also confused as to its tone. It tries to take its superhero world seriously, like the Tim Burton's ""Batman"" but also adds in tongue-in-cheek humor and makes attempts to be self-referential and campy, like the Joel Schumaker ""Batmans"".

","I remember this being largely anticipated. I watched the Iron Man movies, so I was going to see this. It had lots of action, but the plot was a little weak. I also didn't understand why they took the villain from Thor and couldn't use someone like Thanos (which is rumored to be the villain for the sequel). Yeah, it had lots of jokes but most of them were too cheesy for me. The best jokes come from Iron Man. It gets a bit boring in the middle part. Overall, I don't think this is a bad movie but I don't think it deserves a spot on the top 250. You should also know I almost never give movies a 10/10. Also the fan base for it is a bit annoying but I should leave that out. The plot is basically a bunch of middle-aged superheroes coming together to fight one of the superhero's brother and his army of Skrulls or Chiatauris if you will. Ruffalo's performance as the Hulk was the best out of any of them, unfortunately there is no Hulk sequel planned for MCU: Phase 2.

","""The Avengers"" is not an average action flick. In fact, it is an excellent one. The success of this film relies not only on the spectacular visual effects and sustained action sequences, but mostly on the characters and the interactions between them. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow, the Hulk, and Hawkeye are treat to watch as they kick ass, exchange clever one-liners, and desperately work together to fight off Loki and his minions. Each actor portrays their character with zeal and believability. We don't just see Robert Downey Jr. sarcastic nature or the ripped biceps of Chris Evans. We see Tony Stark/Iron Man and Captain America saving the world from certain demise. As a result, we find ourselves cheering them on! This is what makes a great super hero flick!

So do I need to maintain my integrity as an amateur reviewer- person by going against the grain and finding fault with the movie? Or can I feel secure in my own opinion, even if it's shared by fanboys and nonfans alike? (Hint: it's the latter.) Who are The Avengers, anyway? Well, there's Captain America (Steve Rogers), who's actually from the 1940s but was frozen for about seventy years. There's Iron Man (Tony Stark), a man in a weaponized metal suit. There's The Hulk (Bruce Banner), who smashes. There's Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff), a superspy with some powers of her own. There's Hawkeye (Clint Barton), a master archer. And then there's Thor, a Norse god. We've been introduced to most of them already through their own films, so they seem like old pals to us.

Don't get me wrong, it's not because the story is bad, as a matter of fact, it's better than most ""we-gotta-save-the-world"" stories involving superheroes. But where The Avengers fails, is when it comes to getting the audience out on the edge of their seats. You never really believe that they actually might fail, and it might be because this movie was aimed at an mainstream audience, that darker themes were left out. After superhero movies like Zack Snyder's ""Watchmen"" (which mixed, ideologies/politics with other deep themes) and Nolan's Batman franchise , The Avengers feels more like a well-made CGI orgy, with funny moments, amidst a story that fails to capture you.

Robert Downey Jr returns once again as Iron Man to help put the avengers initiative into full motion. Chris Evans returns as well as Captain America after being frozen in ice for decades who is still trying to adjust to the new and improved world to also help recover the Tesseract. Chris Hemsworth returns as Thor to help bring a end to Loki's terror on Earth and bring him home. Mark Ruffalo takes over from Edward Norton's Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk and I much like his portrayal a bit better than Edward Norton's just, because I feel like he captures Banners/Hulks likeness a little bit better like it should be. Scarlett Johansson returns as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow to save Clint Barton/Hawkeye played by Jeremy Renner who is under a type of hypnosis by Loki's control and bring him back to fight on the avengers side. Tom Hiddleston is more menacing and terrifying than ever as Loki, making his performance in this one of my favorite villains in the MCU.

","Hands down, best superhero movie till date. It had the right mix of story and action sequences. The movie spends the first half of its time in building the story. Although Marvel had already laid some foundation for this story in its previous movies. (Tesseract was seen in Captain America: The First Avenger) The second half of the movie is where you get to see all the action, hulk smashing the giant flying robot, hulk smashing Loki and hulk saving iron man. Geez, it seems like hulk was really enjoying himself out there. Well, coming back to the story so, S.H.I.E.L.D was trying to harness tesseract energy and thus it fell on the radar of the Loki(or we should say thanos). Now, Loki had made this deal with thanos that he will deliver tesseract to him if he helps him in conquering earth. So, Loki arrives on earth, steals the tesseract from SHIELD and uses it to create a portal and call an army. Now, it's up to avengers, our superheroes to stop Loki and save earth. The movie is packed with pretty bad-ass fighting scenes. You get to see the battle between Thor and iron man. You also get to see Thor using his hammer on captain America's shield. And of course, then there is the battle between avengers and Loki's army. Coming to characters, I think movie mostly revolves around iron man, Loki and hulk. Captain America seemed useless in this movie. Hope they use him in a better way in next avengers. Loki is clearly one of the wittiest characters in the marvel universe. NO wonder why people love him.

The Avengers having arguing with each other is really good especially the one where Loki was in prison and the reason the dialogue is so good is because these characters are very different from each other and them arguing is very interesting cause you get see their opinion on different subjects and their motives and morals and that's really good when it comes to character one thing that justice league never managed to succeed on.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

The main antagonist of the movie is Loki (Tom Hiddleston). The movie is an Action/ Comedy / Adventure/Sci-fi film.

He is part of an organization called S.H.I.E.L.D. and he brings together a team of super humans to form The Avengers to save the Earth from Loki and his army.

Anyone worried that Joss Whedon would make something this epic look like TV work needs worry no more. Visually it is a sight to behold and as epic as it deserves to be. I don't remember when I enjoyed a film THIS much and I really loved a lot of 2011's offerings. This movie just hits the highest level possible for me. It works on all of its own terms, there's no weighted enjoyment or cinematic slumming involved in enjoying it. It really IS a smart action film and the cast really delivered as expected. With this exceptional cast involved, how could it not? Whedon knew who his aces were and how to play them. Downey and Jackson are CLASSIC. That's not to say every major character didn't shine at one point it's just that when the beats mattered, the big guns when front and center. I also LOVED what Whedon did with Loki and how much of a home run Tom Hiddleston hit. Avengers truly a remarkable movie treat and I'm glad to see that the majority of film fans agree with me.

","Joss Whedon finally gets an enormous budget to play with as he co-writes and directs this slab of super powered fun. Highly watchable from the first scene to the inevitable 'Easter Egg', Whedon made the crucial decision to please the fans. At no point during the mammoth 142 minutes play time does it feel unnecessarily dragged out. Robert Downey Jr. again excels as Tony Stark/Iron Man, however the other cast members deserve a lot of credit for not letting his performance overshadow theirs. Mark Ruffalo is near perfect as Bruce Banner/The (Incredible) Hulk, taking the role from Ed Norton who played the less than jolly green giant in his last big screen outing. As a friend said, 'At last they got Hulk right'. Indeed! The Hulk provides two moments of pure comedy, without insulting his mythos, a hurdle lots of comic hero adaptations fail to clear. CGI is used to enhance rather than substitute for plot, something other blockbusters should take note of. People unfamiliar with the Marvel characters could be confused as to who's who and why. But I'm sure after a little bit they'll be able to sit back and enjoy. There is a glaring continuity error though. In some scenes, the arc reactor in Stark's chest can clearly be seen glowing beneath his T-shirt, as it should be because if it wasn't glowing he'd be dead. Then in other scenes whilst Stark's in 'civvies' no arc reactor can be seen. In a film of this magnitude and budget this seems quite negligent. 'Avengers Assemble' will be the movie to beat of 2012 in terms of sheer entertainment. We saw it in I-Max which, unlike normal 3D is worth paying for.

Although everyone who enjoys this movie will need to be willing to accept the fantastical elements of the characters and main plot points, this movie is successful because it is logical and reasonable beyond those openly accepted fantastical characters. The action is exciting, imaginative and well shown. But the greatest strength of the movie was the development of the characters. We didn't need to know the comic book facts about the characters to understand what was happening. Moreover, the characters had personality: they were reasonably complex and interacted with enough pressure against each other to understand them as more than just ""cardboard"" comic book cut-outs. The highlight was the humoristic quips between the heroes. I recommend that you see this in the cinema in the 3-D version, as the 3-D is done well and not the over-the-top 3-D of yester-years.

Number One, Hulk wasn't played by Ed Norton, instead we got Mark Ruffalo. In my opinion, he just felt out of place.

As far as the look of her character black widow i would say she is no where near what she should look like. In all of her fight scenes she looks non atlethic and you can clearly tell when the stunt double fills in for her. Her fight scenes were laughable and really brought the rest of the great cgi fight scenes down. The second half of the film drags a bit with a lot of the Chitari henchmen being used as cannon fodder for our heroes and are are dispatched so easily you would wonder why there were sent in the first place as most of them are incompetent or just plain stupid! Its a solid enough film just let down a lot by Johansson and Jeremy Renner who was used as filler since the cgi fight scenes between the Hulk, Capt, Thor and iron man must have cost a pretty penny and they obviously felt it was too much of a risk to over spend in case the film bombed.

Unfortunately the script failed miserably in that department. Since Joss Wheadon (who is himself a great graphic novel writer ) was helming the multi starrer, expectation was that he will have something more than just big effects. Super heroes movies like Spider-man & the Dark Knight are blockbusters but have a great story to tell as well.

Nick Fury assembles the Avengers: The Ironman (Robert Downey Jr brilliant as always), Captain America & The Hulk and Thor to fight against the other worldly aliens.

","The Avengers is a fun movie, fun to watch with no feeling of shame for liking it.

The special effects are as good as we recently came to expect them and the pace is just perfect for the film, which is much to say for an action film that lasts more than two hours. I especially liked the performance of Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johansson, and Tom Hiddleston is also very impressive as the very evil Loki, but almost every one on screen does a good professional job, which has a lot to do with the way the roles were written. - I know I said it already, I simply think it deserves repeating.

The movie is all style no substance and the best of the characters and the best actor by far, Mark Ruffallo as Bruce Banner gets a backseat ride as marvel poster boy (although better as Sherlock Holmes) Robert Downey Jnr. tries to make it a one man show. Chris Evans has grown as an actor, he is no longer a sarcastic wise cracking idiot, he is now the leader struggling to find his place in other words depressed a'la Kirsten Stewart in twilight. People that find the time to whine about the voices with regard to every Batman actor ever gracing the silver screen will delight in Chris Hemsworth's attempt at Asgard as a province right next to Queensland, Australia, a more irritating growl hasn't been heard since Christian Bale took over the mantel. Tom Hiddleston seems bored and irritated by the role which he perfectly played in Thor, it seems the paycheck was large enough to get him to appear but not large enough to make an effort. Hawkeye, why even include him? he is a character best left killed off every second week in a marvel comic. Samul L Jackson, remember him for Pulp Fiction, forget him for everything else, David Hasslehoff has never seem to be a better choice for any role until it was announced that the ultimate fury would be played by Samuel. Black Widow, wow more useless than the Power Pack, less Russian than the state of Kentucky and more wooden that south African oak. You should be thanking you're lucky stars that the nude photos actually leaked, it gave you somewhat of a career. Let's get to the actually headache inducing story, David s Goyer should be knocking down doors at Marvel Entertainment, threatening to sue them if he does not get his royalties cheque. It is almost like they tried to take every superhero movie ever made and bash it into one script, American City in trouble, Check. Everything falls to the front, Check. The heroes do not get along ala Fantastic four but love each other as they are, check. Josh Whedon influenced sci-fi, oh check check and more check. I am rooting for the next film to include a scene where Kolkata is attacked or maybe even better, Johannesburg, South Africa. The Cap lands in hillbrow, all of a sudden a Nigerian drug dealer arrives, aims for his head but shoots him in the leg (they can steal another idea because plagiarism seems to be the only method they make movies, ""you should have bought American"" just before he falls into a coma). You get the idea (maybe hawkeye stand on top of a tower in Chicago or Port Elizabeth, and a gust of wind takes him tumbling into oblivion where he belongs. To sum up the story, Armageddon (the city Scenes), every marvel movie ever produced, steel magnolias and every David Goyer script. Simple as pie. give this a skip, don't give into the hype that every teenager wants you to believe, they are the same guys that transformers to the top of the box office while movies like Senna, Drive rotted in obscurity.

The sure helmsman, Joss Whedon has exploded into a place so many of us Whedonites have known about for so long - we lost Buffy, Angel, Spike etc., We lost Captain Mal and Jayne, but now Joss has finally given the world what we all know he's capable of - an explosion of action/adventure that never fails to amaze, engage and to take the breath away - add that to the most fantastic one liners, sharp dialogue, character focus and the asset that is Robert Downey Jnr as Tony Stark/Iron Man and you've got a complete set of everything. Chris Hemsworth brings such surety as Thor, his presence is god like in many ways whilst Tom Hiddleston plays the most charismatic bad guy in years. Add in the fantastic Hawkeye, portrayed brilliantly by Jeremy Renner - Chris Evans as Captain America and Scarlett Johanson as Black Widow - finished off with an awe inspiring performance from Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner and you pretty much have the most incredible spectacle in cinema history. I am a huge fan of the individual movies, but this just smashed the lot. The size is beyond words and let us not forget what Samuel L Jackson and Clark Gregg bring to the cast. Fantastic, brilliant, amazing - watch out for the great battles between Thor and Hulk, Iron Man and Hulk and how well they fit into the film.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

Mark Ruffalo finally makes the hulk likable and the CGI hulk was pretty bad ass. Tom Hiddleston is an awesome Loki. He's not as good as he was in Thor, but I'm not sure that was even possible.

","For four years, Marvel fans all over the world has been anticipating for one of the biggest superhero mash-ups in motion picture history. We have been promised this movie for so long, that now one of the biggest motion picture phenomenons has finally hit theaters. Big superhero names such as Iron Man, the Hulk, Thor, and Captain America has finally recruited together, and they're off to save the world, once again, in an unstoppable group. Wow, this is easily the best movie of the year so far. I can talk for hours and hours about how excellent this movie is. First of all, director/co-writer Joss Whedon is probably one of the best storytellers to know how to make a movie and its characters realistic and relevant. Take Joss Whedon's previous film, ""The Cabin in the Woods"", for example, which does a perfect job of making the story look realistic, and the characters look totally relevant. That's the movie-making magic that Joss Whedon adds in ""The Avengers"". Filled with comical gags, this movie also feels like a 2-hour action comedy film. The jokes are timed precisely, and the humor is downright believable. Robert Downey, Jr. is still wonderful for his performance as Tony Stark, a.k.a Iron Man, Chris Hemsworth is brilliant as ""Thor"", Mark Ruffalo delivers one of the best portrayals of Bruce Banner, a.k.a The Hulk ever seen on screen, and Chris Evan delivers a more better performance as Captain America. We also have a supporting cast that reprises their roles from previous Marvel movies such as Scarlett Johansson (drop-dead gorgeous) as Black Widow, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Tom Hiddleston as the villainous Loki, Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson, Stellan Skarsgard as Erik Selvig, and Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts. It's such a wonderful treat to watch all these Marvel characters that we all know and love, and place them all into one movie. The 3-D only works a few times, but the breathtaking action scenes are just downright breathtaking, exhilarating, exciting and mostly entertaining. The action scenes are probably some of the best action scenes ever put to film. You'll be on the edge of your seat, wanting for more! The comedy is just hilariously relevant, the action is downright entertaining, and the characters are written in such a realistic way. I sat in the movie theater, with the 3-D glasses, and the entire auditorium was fully packed with tons of super fans. Everyone was laughing, applauding, and cheering during the entire 2-hour, 22-minute movie. I can easily see why! This is a non-stop exciting cinematic phenomenon that perfectly knows how to do one thing, and one thing only: give the fans what they want! ""The Avengers"" is a hilarious, exciting, breathtaking, and non-stop fun motion picture that deserves the attention given from fans all over the world. This is also one of the best movies of the year!

970,29 April 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,8," It feels especially small now, but was a massive move for Marvel and is always an entertaining experience.
","There's a sense of infancy and an accompanying intimacy, despite the large scale ending, because 'Avengers Assemble (2012)' is, for all intents and purposes, so retrospectively small and yet actually so big. It represents a keen, unprecedented challenge for writer/director Joss Whedon and it was a 'surprise' success to the delight of many a fan and studio-head across the globe. The fact it pulls off a six character crossover, without a clear protagonist I'll add, is impressive, and slightly concerning. It's also consistently entertaining and fast-paced, packing in all the action and spectacle you'd expect along with the quick character moments that make it stand out. There's the occasionally hammy line or ever so slightly cheesy moment, actually evocative of Whedon's style, that's only more amplified by the distance afforded by time and the fact that this flick wasn't what the MCU now is nor was it what the MCU then was, as it represented a shift in the 'universe' that was then shifted again rather quickly. These inconsistencies, of tone and character both past and prophetic future, aren't major issues and are often marked by moments of clairvoyant clarity or otherwise pitch perfection pertaining to comic-book character personas and, as such, the relatively plotless piece is still a delight to behold. It's smashy-bashy finale is also especially well-realised, though showing its age now, and feels like a tangible sequence rather than a series of green-screen sets connected by digital extensions. It isn't the best Marvel film, but it represented a big leap for the studio, and the genre as a whole, and is an enjoyable ride throughout. 8/10",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","I appreciate this film for what it is. An all out action popcorn movie that aims to wow the audience with its cutting edge effects, fancy camera work and ability to not have to think, and just sit back. The plot was pretty simple and nothing new in terms of old clichéd, alien guy tries to take over the world with his army and big doomsday device scenario with an ending we have seen a million times before with a ""Lets destroy a city with as much explosions and CGI as possible"" chapter. Don't get me wrong, they did a great job with it. Some of the camera work was excellent, much better than Micheal Bay's close up and shake the camera around everywhere technique. But for me personally I don't like being overwhelmed with all the CGI and the camera taking me away from the characters involvement of the scene and scenario and focusing on the effects. The only thing that kept me going till the end was the humor. If it was not for that I would have rated this film as just another bland CGI bonanza. A good attempt, but for me, not as amazing as everyone is making it out to be. The effect's are amazing, the humor is good, but everything else..seen it before..bored of it.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","OK, I'm going to have to start with the negatives about this film. Oh wait, there isn't any! In all seriousness, this film was incredible! I went to the cinema and watched it in 3D. I already knew that the film was going to be good by reading reviews and going on what my friends said it was like. A large group of us went to watch it and came out wanting to watch it again. There isn't a single scene in it that is boring or that drags. The acting is top class. You think that watching a film with lots of superheroes is going to be cheesy or poor in acting performance. Not with this film. The cheesiest thing about Avengers Assemble was Captain America's suit and, to be honest, that's not even cheesy. The graphics were outstanding, which is what you hope for when you realize the film cost $220 Million to make! Every time you saw the Hulk smashing things up was incredible and not to mention the incredible scene where you see the Aircraft Carrier actually turn into and Aircraft!

Joss Weddon did it, and did it well! All actors playing th amin avengers were superb and Loki us currently, and I'm pretty sure will remain for a while, one of the best villains in any one of these movies. The best part was how different it was from any other Marvel movie. There were funny quips and retorts between a couple of the characters that added the comedic touch perfectly, Coulson's death was sad, but it was the motivation needed for the team.

","Finally, after 5 years of waiting the Avengers have finally assembled! That means no more teasing from that bold, black guy with an eye patch and having to wait through the end credits but more importantly we get see Earths mightiest heroes join forces for the first time. Should you and your friends assemble to the cinema to see it? The plot is simple and straightforward which involves Loki, the God of mischief entering Earth through a portal using the tesseract which is a glowing cube of doom, along with Loki's glowing staff of doom he possesses the minds of Clint Barton and Dr Erik Selvis. In response to this takeover Nick Fury decides to reinstate the avengers initiative to recruit Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and my favourite of the bunch Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) who we are all reintroduced to before the team finally mobilizes. Everyone is present and correct accept for Spiderman, Aunt May was ill at the time you see. The Story is as silly as it sounds with the villain's diabolical plan but director Joss Whedon managers to pull it off with the story's memorable and iconic characters rubbing shoulders. The Avengers is also about the clash of egos which must be overcome if they want to succeed against Loki. Whedon is self aware of how silly a team of colourful superheroes coming from vastly different backgrounds' coming together really is with these characters mocking and taunting ways each other in playful and witty ways being the highlight of the movie offering some hilarious moments such as Tony's confrontation with Thor and Steve Rogers having to adjust to modern day tech no babble. As good as the script writing is there are moments where the dialogue feels over the top such as the Chitauri's conversations with Loki. There are also moments which are needed to be taken more seriously that weren't and mixed both tragedy and comedy. What really makes the Avengers great was the banter which ensued by putting these characters together. Banner and Stark get along well because of their intellect however Stark is put off by Rogers who he thinks as ""a lab experiment"" Watching these personalities collide is almost like watching a reality T.V show. This makes the ark the characters go through more prevailing as they gradually come to accept the responsibility of being a team and finding common ground with their vendetta against Loki. This brings us to our villain Loki (Tom Hiddleston) who I thought would be a generic villain took me by surprise. I was expecting an over the top clichéd performance just like the loud and lacklustre Red Skull from ""Captain America"" but I was wrong Loki has versatility and depth being the God of mischief he has a sense of humour to go along with his slimy and crafty attitude. His motivation maybe mad but he gets it across with such conviction making this the best on screen villain since Heath Ledgers Joker from ""The Dark Knight"". The action scenes are brilliantly shot and handled the final action scene is just the right length however there is little suspense with our heroes being immune to every knock, explosion and everything else that is thrown at them however the spectacle is amazing to behold the action and the special effects also have substance behind them giving it more significance thanks to the brilliant ensemble cast of likable personalities. Who doesn't like the fact of the ego manic Tony Stark taking on a massive metal space worm? Michael Bay will probably be in a huff that Joss Whedon can destroy New York better then Chicago. The camera work is also very creative with a scene panning across everyone bickering but as they bicker the camera shows Loki's staff activating behind them. I don't know how Marvel has done it but ""The Avengers"" lives up to the hype. It redefines the fun and frantic comic book movie which proves you don't have to have a superhero movie be dark and brooding for it to be well received critically. It definitely is a breath of fresh air for a summer blockbuster to have substance behind its crazy style. The Avengers maybe silly and predictable but silly and predictable can be good sometimes thanks to its likable characters and entertaining story to create a thrilling experience. 8/10 Memorable moments It's hard to pick just one so I will pick one for each of my favourite Avengers Captain America-Taking control and leading the team in the final battle despite being dressed up like a blueberry Thor- Face off with Iron man in the woods Iron Man-Confronting Loki in Stark tower The Hulk-Giving Loki the old fashioned comic book Thwack and Thwomp.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","SPOILERS AHEAD Let me preface it by saying I have never been a fan of the Marvel comics and only found a couple of the set-up movies to be decent. However, I was still intrigued because of the very good reviews from critics and the box office success. After watching, this is not what I would consider a good film. It's basically on par or slightly above Michael Bay's Transformers series, and anyone who has read my reviews of those knows how low I think of them (even the best, the original, is really only average). Avengers is pretty well made, decently well acted, and slickly produced. But it just doesn't have a good story and the premise is basically absurd. First, the villain is nothing special. Loki's motives are vague, his plan confusing at best, and at no point is his character even that menacing. Right from the start you know that Thor or Iron Man or Hulk could kick the crap out of him so there's never any suspense as to whether Loki would succeed. Second, all the science and techno talk throughout makes little sense and is very difficult to follow. I found myself not caring about Iron Man and Bruce Banner's supposed genius after a while. The script is just soooo formulaic. You know the heroes will have personality clash at first, you know there will be a sombering event that will pull them all together, and you know they will prevail. This has been done a million times in these movies and to be honest, it's been done way better.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

Luckily, this movie ISN'T a bad finale, quite the contrary in fact. The plot is well thought out, the pacing is pretty good, but what makes this movie great are the interactions between the characters. Having set up all the important ones in the previous movies, this movie utilizes every character trait of each character as a way of creating both conflicts and collaborations. Every character has their way of dealing with things, and when they all get put in the same room, natually there will be arguments.

The action is well made, the performances are fantastic, and the story feels grand and important, fitting for such a movie.

","6 May 2012. Few ensemble movies, especially superhero movies offer the balanced, cohesive narrative that make for a well edited, rich character developed, and strongly compelling storyline. Unfortunately for The Avengers, though record-breaking at the box office not withstanding, The Avengers, can at best, be considered entertaining, but is more aptly described as a rather forced piece of movie scriptwriting and directing that attempts to corral a rather disparate bunch of superheros with mixed results. Unlike the more acceptable and appealing television series ensemble of super people in Heroes (2006-2010) or even the more enjoyable animated feature film of super family members in The Incredibles (2004), and the funny team of disparate members including the straight man (female) Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis in Ghostbusters (1984), The Avengers awkwardly introduces its Superheroes almost in sequel form, some with even chaotic brief flashbacks, that results in an uneasy alliance that feels quite uncomfortable as if the Jess Whedon himself was having trouble with his dialogue between the superheroes. As an example, Gwyneth Paltrow, unlike Rick Moranis in Ghostbusters (1984) is never given the opportunity to really have a solid place in the movie. And even the highly praised performance of Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk, even this bi-polar identity is left in doubt as The Hulk is presented as two different personas, earlier in the movie as this Beast and then later somewhat more questionable as this conscientious animal (which as an animal is quite unlikely a transformation). There is an apparent imbalance in the presentation among Ironman and Captain America and Thor. X-Men (2000), Fantastic Four (2005), and Star Trek (2009) all have a much more polished set-ups between their disparate ensemble characters. Instead Joss Whedon has introduced dollops of solid stand-up comic one-liners and humor that seems pretentious clever cover-ups even as they hit home. Unlike his own previous ensemble work in the well received Buffy: The Vampire Slayer (1997-2003) and Angel (1999-2004) series, here Joss Whedon is seemingly unable to recapture the same smooth but edgy magic as those earlier television series. The storyline also seems to veer in several isolated superhero scenes that make the overall rhythm and flow of the story rocky in its depiction on the screen, there seems too many characters and too many simultaneous events going on at the same time, almost more the actor script contractual obligations of screen time rather than for the integrity of the story itself. Inception (2010) probably includes some of the best integrated separate story lines that are presented simultaneously in its unique movie within and movie within a movie technique or Pulp Fiction (1994), Traffic (2001) and The Air I Breathe (2007) interweave several plot strands in a nicely, enriched presented fashion. It is apparent that some efforts at making this movie stand out with a few enhancements in special effects (like the destruction scene shot from the perspective of one of the vehicles being hurdled in the maelstrom) and several minutes of dialogue of lofty sounding metaphysical and emotional depth, yet the overall impact is more superficial without the emotive and intellectual probing found in even more singularly focused superhero movies as Green Lantern (2011), Elektra (2005), Spiderman 2 (2004) or Spiderman 3 (2007). Of particularly, note it almost seems like the news media has been influenced by over-reporting the critical acclaim of this movie as Metacritic rates it only a 69 which while good isn't really outstanding by any means, contributing to a rather false marketing effort in itself suggesting that some movie critics are in league with the movie industry itself.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","Why ""The Avengers"" could easily become a huge success? I think even some of you could answer thiz question. Thiz movie is the culmination of Marvel's hard work over the past couple of years. The lucky guy who was appointed to direct thiz movie is Joss Whedon. The director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) initiates the Avengers initiative by assembling all the super humans to save the world from the powerful evil Loki (Tom Hiddleston). The storyline isn't as dynamic as I think it is, there's a time when the story is stuck and filled with unnecessary dialogue. The power of thiz movie obviously lies in its character interactions. Nick Fury is originally written as a white guy in the comic book but Samuel L. Jackson confidently steps in to play thiz character. Thiz isn't the first time thiz has happened. It reminds me when Michael Clarke Duncan portrayed the overweight crime boss Kingpin in Ben Affleck's ""Daredevil"" (2003) and I'm also so excited to see Laurence Fishburne as Clark Kent's boss Perry White in upcoming Superman's ""Man of Steel"" (2013). However, in thiz case, I didn't see Samuel L. Jackson became Nick Fury, instead it was Nick Fury became Samuel L. Jackson. But in the end, it's totally acceptable. Samuel L. Jackson is able to present a precise leadership aura to his Nick Fury's character. Once again, I have to remind you, what made thiz movie so interesting is when these superheroes gather around and interact with each other. We can see ""The Duo Chris"", Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth who successfully demonstrate their muscular bodies, just like in ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" (2011) and ""Thor"" (2011). Thiz is how superheroes should look like! The brand new figures in thiz movie are the master archer Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and the elegant Agent Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders who is widely known in ""How I Met Your Mother"" {2005-present}). The other figures who have been introduced since ""Iron Man 2"" are the loyal Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) and the sexy heroine Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Surprisingly, Scarlett Johansson has a fairly large part in thiz movie. Wait a minute, on second thought, if you have Scar Jo in tight sexy latex suit, of course you will exploit it more. If we're talking about Iron Man, thiz is also one of the most interesting parts. It looks like Robert Downey Jr. have already fused into thiz Tony Stark's character so deep, he can represent thiz self-centered character very well without any problem. But in thiz movie, the one who really becomes a scene stealer is the giant green rage monster named Hulk! Once again, it's the Hulk's character, not exactly Dr. Bruce Banner or Mark Ruffalo but it's all of them in one. Some fresh and funny moments are obviously when Hulk is around. The most unfortunate thing is that they didn't bring up the original founding team such as Ant-Man and The Wasp into the movie. In the end, I confidently can say Marvel Comics seems to be one step ahead from its competitor DC Comics so far. Recently, thiz movie has ruled the box office chart and it turns out to be the earth's mightiest blockbuster movie. You know what that means, right? Oh yeah, the next Avengers movie will be coming soon. Maybe next time Marvel Studios will enrich their universe with the presence of other superheroes like Quicksilver, Black Panther, Vision, Doctor Strange, She-Hulk, Wolverine, even Spider-Man. Are you ready for another one?",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","Faced with an existential threat posed by Asgardian renegade Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) assembles a team of ""Earth's mightiest heroes"", including Ironman, Thor, The Hulk, Captain America, Black Widow and Hawkeye (Robert Downey Jr. Chris Hemsworth Mark Ruffalo + CGI, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner respectively). Loki's plan revolves around possession of the Tesseract, the same glowing blue MacGuffin that plagued Captain America in his debut solo film ('Captain America: The First Avenger', 2001). The disparate team of egos and alter egos meets, squabbles, reconciles, and finally cooperates as the skies open and Loki's Chitauri army attacks the Big Apple. All of the heroes (super and otherwise) are well played and fun, and Tom Hiddleston is excellent as the conniving Loki. The overall story is entertaining and the film, especially the climactic battle, very well made. All in all, a good start to the complex story arc at the core of the popular and profitable franchise.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","The Avengers Movie - I don't really know what to expect. Massive disasters, huge rescue team. At first I don't really like the team up of Thor, Captain America, Iron Man, HULK, Hawkeye, and Black Widow in a squad against the naughty God of Loki. It is very true for a fictional movie to be irrational and illogical in some part of it, but the combination itself seemed weird, especially they came from a very different time and dimensions. Though it was explained very briefly in the movie, I still can't find it successful to convince me with it. I quite excited with the first 60minutes when the team was built up again, with all conflicts and funny stuffs. Thanks to Mr. Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) for his sense of humor. Actions were of course, as expected. You could never get enough of it. Though I might afraid you gonna find it somehow too 'easy' somehow, some part of it. My favorite character certainly goes to Miss Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) with her witty techniques of interrogation. The cast was used very wisely. They played a very beautiful role in this movie. Storyline of every superheroes movie wasn't really worth discuss for. Good versus evil, justice win over the bad guy's plan and etc. Two things I like the most are the enough time (141minutes) with no boredom, and when the teammates were scattered all around. But I don't really think when the superhero music played and they assembled with Capt. Steve Rogers took the lead was the climax that we really wanted to watch. Old-fashioned, and too usual. And I believe the ending wasn't that satisfying too. It was very entertaining though. Worth every penny. And I don't know, may be it's still one of the best movie in this year. Should get almost 5.

","The Avengers is the best summer blockbuster for a long time, it balances all elements of fun, drama, action, special effects, multiple egos into a well directed, paced movie. The film has perfectly edited action set pieces, no fast editing like say transformers and it benefits hugely. The first 30 minutes are fairly slow build up, but after that the last hour especially is amazing. Credit has to go to the director, you really can tell he has a love for the source material and gets all the characters to interact and each share their own moments throughout the film. The drama is not as dark as say the dark knight. As people have been saying it is a very funny film with some laugh out moments. The Avengers is simply amazing, Hollywood is in for a bumper year this year with so many high profile releases yet to come, The Dark Knight Rises, Spider-Man, Skyfall, The Hobbit.

","The Avengers was so much fun and Marvel absolutely nailed it! Let me explain what I loved! Positives: 1. The characters; this is a no brainer! Without these awesome characters this film would be nothing. They honestly shape this film and their banter and chemistry with one another is awesome! There are a lot of humorous as well as heartfelt moments which all lend to an awesome film! 2. The villain; Loki in my opinion is the best villain of the MCU. He has motivation you understand and his rivalry with Thor is mesmerizing! Tom Hiddleston once again does a fantastic job as this character and he was the perfect villain for this movie. 3. The action; all of the action is done well! There is quite a lot of CGI, but it doesn't get in the way of the film, and because of these awesome characters all the action and explosions have weight to them. If these characters hadn't been characterized properly, and it didn't have a well made story then this film would've probably turned out like a Transformers movie. Thankfully that was not the case and all the action was awesome! Overall: I have no cons with this film that I can think of. The Avengers is one of the best comic book films I've ever seen! It is by far one of the best things Marvel has ever done and it was one of the most fun I've had watching a movie! Even if you aren't a comic book fan I guarantee you will enjoy this film!

Needless to say, I was not disappointed. This film was, there's only one way to put this... INCREDIBLE! The special effects were out of the world, literally the best effects I have ever seen, on a larger scale than the most recent Transformers film, but less in your face and over powering.

","The Avengers I could tell you is the greatest film of our time or possibly the greatest. I came into this film with minor expectations after seeing the trailer but being a comic book fan I decided I should give it a go and mate this was one spectacular film done very well by Joss Whedon the man famous for putting together Buffy the Vampire Slayer certainly knows how to write a script with almost every line memorable and giving all the heroes a chance to do something cool with nothing left out that could ruin the plot 2012's the Avengers has done a job well done.The Avengers Iron Man/Tony Stark/Robert Downey Jr was at his very best performing with ease and I actually thought he was cool in this,Chris Hemsworth plays the Norse god Thor who was just awesome in this film and showed.Hawkeye played by Jeremy Renner did a job well done especially with the arrow shots. Finally we found the perfect person to play the Hulk/Bruce Banner as Mark Ruffalo looks like a nerd and doesn't look angry in every scene like the other Hulks and made the Hulk look like a cool guy rather than the others who took it like it was a curse. Scarlett Johansen improves from her kick ass performance in Iron Man 2 to become a real person you would not want to make angry and proves to us she is in for more than just the good looks. Tom Hiddelston pulled of our villain very well and if you though he was cool in Thor he was even more cooler in this and probably the best villain since the Dark Knight.

","This is a basic comic book film handled with style and finesse in the hands of Joss Whedon. I've always been a fan of his, and I'm glad to see he finally got his chance to shine on. The premise of the film is Loki, brother of Thor, steals the Tesseract, from last summer's ""Captain America"" and uses it to unleash his own army upon the world, and claim it as his Kingdom. However, this is the weakest point in the film. In reaction to these events, Nick Fury calls upon his most wonderful of agents, and assembles them, somewhat, to deal with this. Here is where Joss Whedon shines. He is a man who knows characters, and has a skill for witty and well-placed dialog, but also of great vision. He understands the ego of all those involved, and plays them off of one another, including a fantastic scene of Iron Man and Thor going toe to toe for the sole sake of their arrogance. Captain America stands as the voice of reason, but his naivety is blatant; his was a simpler time. Black Widow stands in the background as a seminal character, but obviously one unused to the limelight. Hulk, played perfectly by Mark Ruffalo, is the humble doctor, always subdued for the sake of safety. These are people who are used to having the spotlight their own, and so they must learn to play well with others, but it isn't until the death of Phil Coulson do they realize the necessity to their alliance, which Joss Whedon displays masterfully in a continuous shot of the group fighting Loki's army in Manhattan. This is not a compelling film, but it respects its characters and uses their own energy to drive the plot in a fun and controlled manner.

Marvel's 'Avengers Assemble' was such and ambitious project because they were tasked with not only bringing together some of the greatest superheroes every written but also making it work. Each one of these heroes (Thor, captain America, Iron man, Black widow, Hawk eye, The hulk) can helm and deliver their own action packed titular vehicle in their own right, so taming the egos (which did flare up during the course of the film) long enough to get the job done was also a commendable task that was accomplished here as was the amazing chemistry shared among all the cast members. Centering the main plot around the alien force of energy known as 'the tesseract' (which has been a subject in other Marvel flicks) was also brilliant. The sub-plots of Natasha's skill set, Loki playing up the hulk and Nick Fury and the S.H.I.E.L.D's insidious agenda for regaining 'the tesseract' were also spot on.

","The Avengers is the story of some of Marvel's well known super heroes that band together in a joint effort to save the world. We know from Men in Black that the world is always in need of saving, so I will take a term from that film and say that this is 'the best, of the best, of the best'! This film has some first rate, spectacular, out of this world and any other term that I can think of to convey how good the special effects, the performances, the casting, the direction and everything else in it is. I did see it in 3-D which was totally worth the added premium. If I were wearing a hat I'd give Joss Whedon (director, writer) a hats off for delivering this action packed extravaganza. The story has very clever dialog in that, the characters are able to convey exactly what the audience needs to know without it seeming as though we are auditing a Super Hero 101 lecture. Although this is what I will call a compilation sequel, it was fresh and original and could have easily stood on its own had we not been given all of the prior introduction movies. Not that I'm complaining about any of them Iron Man Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) was successfully arrogant and enduring at the same time. His and Hulk Bruce Banner's (Mark Ruffalo) intellectual bonding was intriguing enough that I'm hoping for an Iron Man featuring Hulk follow up film. The Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) sibling rivalry could render countless sequels and was front and center in this story, but I will expect to see Heimdall (Idris Elba) in any subsequent stories or no deal. My only issue with the set up films is that there was only the small side story featuring Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) in Iron Man. I kept hearing James Brown in my head singing 'This Is a Man's World', but from where I sat it wouldn't be nothing without a woman or a hulk, I mean a girl. Natasha Romanoff held her own in this boys fight club and riding on the success of this film could easily carry a Black Widow film. I know, I know historically the female super hero lead doesn't fare well at the box office, but I blame the vehicle not the passenger. Ever since the Incredibles I have these smiling moments when the bad guys start monologuing, Hulk has the best response to it I've seen to this day.

","Let me reiterate, 10 line minimum impractical and extremely annoying. Minimum and maximum amt. of words, that is truly a lame brain policy. Topic of Thor, How much common sense did Stan Lee put into creating this particular comic book hero? Norse gods are nothing more than superstitious myths/theology. Far more rational to believe these ancient stories are based off how man at the time perceived the science of older races with far more advanced technology. Science will eventually disprove the existence of gods and a high percentage of ancient mysteries that some attribute to aliens, or time travelers. Here is a theory it is believed in the scientific community that life evolved and perished repeatedly over the past 4 billion yrs., what if not all those who evolved to create their own technology died out, they would be so advanced they would easily be able to hide among society today. Witless faith people as in Jehova, or anyone else who quote their particular religious text chapter and verse wake up, those disasters conveyed in religious texts are bunk, again all can rationally be explained through science in this case natural disasters. Maybe that is why we are not forced to actually make sacrifices to these alleged gods, because they sympathize with us because they can still recall when they were much like us, the truly god-like do not expect to be worshiped. As for the character of Loki if Norse myths/theology is based on advanced beings from space or remnants of past advanced earth civilizations, I like to think of the Star Trek animated episode of the Enterprise traveling to the center of the galaxy and the crew finding themselves in a dimension where things can be created merely by one's thoughts. In preceding mentioned STTAS, the character Loki, who was also Lucifer, or should I say the Patron Saint Of Enlightenment was actually much more like Thor seeing potential in the inhabitants of our planet to grow and become compassionately wise. Fact be told the Tora most likely describes Satan as wicked because he did not see the logic in keeping mortals ignorant whether it means complete peace or not. Alright that is enough about Viking gods and myths/theology. When did David, middle name or not David at least is a respectable sounding name, Bruce sounds like a name that should be applied to the mentally deficient such as your Christian Coalition, inbred, hillbilly, redneck type, much like the name Douglas where you feel tempted to say Dougie, or Doogie, might as well say Doobie, because you would expect someone with such a stupid sounding name to have zero brain wave activity such as person high on THC. Digress again which 1 is compelled to do from the start (* 10 line minimum). I have never been much of a reader of comic books, more important things to save what little money I had on, but shame on the screen writers of this movie, from what I know about the fictitious character of the Hulk, all texts cast Dr. David Bruce Banner/Hulk as a Dr. of medicine, more precisely biochemist/geneticist and possibly microbiologist in this movie he was no more than a physicist which means he would have no chance of curing his genetic mutation since 1 would not only need to have some knowledge in physics, but more so in biochemistry and genetics. Confused as to the part of the part where Nick Fury is explaining to Steve Rogers about the Hulk being created out scientific research related to the technique that create him, come on now, scientific knowledge of the first half of the 20th century. If you exposed anyone to gamma radiation with what little knowledge was known about effects of any given amount throughout much of the 20th century they would have died from radiation poisoning. Considering there has been so much talk about the dangers of radio waves, electromagnetism judged from people who have been exposed to RADAR type devices, or high levels of electromagnetism such as high voltage power lines, transformers without sufficient research you will die. Banner's survival was because his nucleotides were rearranged in a fashion that prevented the radiation levels from killing him. What is the source of this version of Banner/Hulk constant anger? Being that this is an entirely different Dr. Banner history from previous story lines the Dr. David Banner of the television series suffered from far more heartache than this 1. Wait do not tell me, Loki will be spewing hatred for his adoptive Asgard brother Thor and Asgard alike along with his condescending loathing of us worthless mortal humans, wreaking havoc and being responsible for more death and destruction, damn either kill the character off or scatter his subatomic particles across the vastness of space, he is an imminent threat to mortals just as Muslims are an imminent threat to those who do not adhere to the same religious doctrine as them. Do I detest the Muslim faith, damn straight I do, because no other religion is followed by people as ignorant and/or state of denial of it's origins as them. My 2 favorite scenes is where Steve Rogers a.k.a. Captain America turns to the Hulk to provide tactical strategy and says Hulk (carefully choosing words) smash, in response the Hulk smiles, and later in the movie where the Hulk is confronting Loki again in an arrogant soliloquy and again proclaims he is a god, indirectly insinuating mortals exist solely for his amusement, and the Hulk grabs him smashing body against the floor and/or walls in response and says puny god.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","An American fantasy action adventure; A story about a stolen mystical artefact which, if activated, will bring about an alien invasion. A spymaster brings together a team of superheroes, including Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and the Hulk, to defend Earth from the impending attack.
The film has a satisfyingly humorous and light-hearted touch with Robert Downey Jr and others delivering fast-talking one liners that break just at the right time. Some of the humour comes from the battle for supremacy among the Avengers which is also gratifying.
That said, while the visual effects and stunts keep the viewer engaged, imagination does lag a little. The fighting is repetitive and while CGI is used well, some of the cartoonish manouevres made by Hulk (in a film trying to keep some semblance of scientific plausibility) are frankly implausible. Tom Hiddlestone gives good menace with wide, piercing eyes and sibilant line delivery, but saly he plays second fiddle to the prime villainy who are featureless.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

The Hulk was a COMPLETE MONSTER in the movie and I was glad he fought Thor. But, the assets( Black Widow and Hawkeye)did a PHENOMENAL job in their part of the movie. Scarlett Johansson was amazing. Thor was more aggressive in this movie than in his own movie. Oh, THOR vs Iron Man was my favorite fight scene. Captain America played a good role in the film. Loki was lethal and unpredictable in the movie. I was laughing so hard when Hulk smashed Loki into the floor. When I seen the movie, the day it came out May 4th 2012, every single person in the audience was laughing so hard. In the post-credits scene I was so surprised to see THANOS.

Beginning in 1961, after the release of the first Fantastic Four comics, through the early 60s, eventually, popular titles, like The Incredible Hulk and Captain America had their own growing pains, mostly related to bad sales at the newsstands, plus reworking of titles or experimentation with other supporting characters.

","The Avengers (Or Avengers Assemble, as it's called over here) was MINDBLOWINGly awesome. It completely lived up to my expectations and then some. Son of Coul :( I loved that all of the characters had something to set them apart. That just made it so much more than your generic popcorn movie, it was funny, touching, exciting... Robert Downey Jr and Whedon are kind of made for each other. ""Performance issues..."" I was almost worried that, because of a few interviews I read where Robert Downey wanted Iron Man to carry the whole thing (seeing as the Iron Man franchise has done the best out of all of the other individual films), the Avengers was going to be Iron Man 2.5, but no. Oh Whedon. You'll never fail me. Despite Captain America being... the least interesting/least dimensional personality (IMO) of the Avengers, he came across brilliantly: a great balance of internal conflict/strong leadership. Thor was just... Brilliant. Chris Hemsworth doesn't play Thor, he IS Thor. That is all. The Hulk almost stole the entire show. After all the negativity and doubt I've seen directed at Ruffalo, he is hands down the best Banner so far. And the Hulk was just...incredible. Hawkeye and Widow worked really, really well. Much better than I'd expected. I friggin' LOVE Renner, and I love that he was part of a darker storyline, he's so good with dark. And Widow was definitely more substantial than I thought she'd be, that was a great scene with her and Loki. If the villain had been cheesy or one dimensional, the story wouldn't have worked. But Loki was amazing. Hiddleston (aka the nicest man in show business) just owned that role. And although Sam Jackson didn't get to say ""I have had it with these motherfuckin' Chitari breaking motherfuckin' New York!"", he did get to shoot a bazooka. Win. As well as adding his trademark wit and humour, there were dozens of other Wheonesque touches that really brought the film together, eg the news report at the end, where people were lighting candles for the casualties. That doesn't really happen in most superhero movies, either the entire city is miraculously evacuated, or the dead aren't acknowledged. Yeah, saw it twice this weekend.

Well this movie has a little bit of both it's very funny and a main character did indeed die, now I won't give away who dies but will say that it won't be a surprise when you see it. The movie had great action scenes their was a great fight between iron man and Thor, and captain America and an absolutely awesome fight scene with Thor facing off with the hulk they tore up shield fighting each other I mean you will go crazy when you see it. Loki was also very evil his intentions are to take over the world and you want him to lose so bad and he does in the end but you will definitely see and admire the evil in him and you will not be disappointed at all particularly with the scene where the black widow is talking to Loki while he is in the cell inside shield the evilness in his voice will scare you to your core he also does a good job controlling his alien army who are the ultimate adversaries for the avengers and the ultimate threat to the entire planet. But anyway the movie was great the heroes each played their part iron man/ Tony stark was a great leader and made the ultimate sacrifice at the end of the film captain America also had great leadership qualities and has adjusted to the new world he is in quite well and Thor helps with his lightning power and strength without which the avengers never would have survived he knew who the aliens were and that he had to stop his brother Loki at all costs the hulk was great too and did a lot of hulk smashing and smashed a few of the alien ships which was very helpful indeed.

Of course it would work because it was in the script:) :) The over all acting was very good if basic. I tend to think we see a large part of the real Robert Downey Jr. in his role of Ironman.

","Not since the original Superman in 1978 or even Batman in 1990 or Spiderman in 2000 has there been a comic book movie that so exploded like this one. Maybe it takes ten-year interims to produce blockbuster superhero movies; I don't know. There has never been a movie that picked up on the characters of several movies at once, least of all from the comic book/superhero genre. Loki ends up on Earth after ""Thor"" and discovers the tesseract (""cosmic cube"") from ""Captain America."" He decides to uses it to conquer the planet, but Nick Fury from ""Iron Man"" uses it to rally ""The Hulk"" and the rest of Earth's Mightiest Heroes into protecting the planet. It has more violence than ""The Dirty Dozen,"" more wrecked cars than ""The Blues Brothers"" and more damage than any of the James Bond films. (Insurance rates in the comic book universe must be astronomical on Manhattan.) It's exactly like watching what you would expect from a comic book brought to life or of you could get into the world of the Marvel Universe (except without the expanded universe characters like the She-Hulk and Ant-Man). The movie never gave me a moment to catch my breath or tear myself away. It is just that compelling. Filled with numerous memorable scenes (Thor battling Iron Man, Hulk batting Thor, Tony getting his suit in mid-air, Hulk smacking Loki around) and numerous quotes (""I've got an army."" – ""Yeah, well, we've got a Hulk.""), the movie and plot charge forward and never slows down. It's augmented by numerous strong performances given by an obscenely talented and gifted cast. Downey's swagger and gift for wry humor carries the incredible film as does Tom Hiddleston's Machiavellian role as Loki, one of the most complicated personalities of the Marvel Universe. Mark Ruffalo succeeds as Bruce Banner (and the Hulk!) where his predecessors could not. There is not a bad performance in the entire movie, not even from Stan Lee in his Hitchcockian traditional cameo or Jeremy Renner in this his first comic book film. (It's had to believe he's the same guy who played a slacker obsessed with drugs and alcohol in ""National Lampoon's Senior Trip."") ""The Avengers"" really deserves to be called ""the greatest comic book movie ever.""

","Aside from a few points of humor, this movie primarily features only endless lame fighting (A knocks down B, B gets up and knocks down A, A gets up... repeat over and over and over). Apparently delightful to Marvel fans, tedious and banal to those who seek something other than the simplistic, well-worn pathway to adolescent male fantasy. Yes, the special effects were well done, though somewhat inconsistent -- why is the Hulk so huge in some scenes, so human-scale in others? Why does the Hulk fear his monster's uncontrollability, when it seems perfectly coordinated with the other superheroes during the fighting, and perfectly peaceful afterward? Why is there no character development whatsoever? Oh, right, it's Marvel. Superheroes in stasis. Throwbacks to a stupider time. ",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","Excelcior my fellow Marvelites! Marvel's The Avengers has finally arrived and I can safely and happily say that not only does it live up to the massive hype surrounding it, but it actually surpasses it. In The Avengers: Iron Man, The Hulk, Hawkeye, Black Widow, Thor, and Captain America all have to team up (Unwillingly I might add) in order to stop Loki and the alien spieces under his servitude(The Chitari) from taking over the Earth. I love this movies' script, for many reasons not the least of which is that it addresses what I was thinking ""Wait, I thought that these people always work alone. How are they going to be able to suck up their pride and fight as a team?"" Well... lets just say that when they first meet each other these heroes don't get along very well. In fact, it is more like a WWE smackdown, since when they first meet they beat the crap out of each other. The reason why this works so well is because of like I said if because of the script. The dialouge is so clever, funny, well-written, and overall good that it raises summer blockbuster standards for scriptwriting. The fact that the awesome director (Joss Whedon. You might recognize him as was the writer for for Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Toy Story, Serenity, Firefly, etc.) also wrote the script, and that he is such a huge comic book fan and he has such an eye for detail that I find incredible. There are so many easter eggs in this movie for Marvel fans to discover (Like in Captain America:The First Avenger), and they are all worth the hunt. The fact that he has written so many scripts and some comic books and directed some TV episodes, it makes sense for him to direct a movie with several different famous superheroes in one movie. I also find it amazing how none of the heroes become the odd one out, each of them do so many badass things that fans of each hero (If they aren't fans of all of them) will be more than satisfied. Everybody in this movie does terrific triple-A performances. It is hard for me to pick out who I liked the best but if I had to choose I'd pick Loki (Tom Hiddleston), and right behind him is Bruce Banner/ The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). The 3D is surprisingly well done, while not Avatar-3D good, it is still pretty damn good. You are probably wondering ""Well how was the action?"" The answer: Really badass! You can always tell what is going on during the many action scenes unlike some other action films out there (Cough*Transformers 2*Cough) and they are all so intense that you don't want them to end. The Avengers is a truly amazing, dazzaling, and breathtaking film that I hold it even higher than The Dark Knight. Marvel has outdone themselves again and for films in general, but they have also obliterated it. It raises the bar for superhero movies. It is truly a movie spectacle that must be seen by all, DC films are going to have to step up their game now. Robert Downey Jr. was right when he said that The Avengers was Marvel's finest hour. I got one question though: What's next Marvel?",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","This movie smashed my expectations! I thought it was going to be another action explosion movie with no plot. But I was mistaken. Joss did a great job with this movie. I'll break it down. ACTING: On a scale of bad, good, or great | The acting was great for this genre. Scarlett Johannsson did a good job as tough girl agent Natasha Romanoff. Jeremy Renner did a good job also as machine level accuracy tough guy Clint Barton. Robert Downey Jr. does a great job as billionaire philanthropist Tony Stark. There's still a lot more! Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston both do a great job as gods Thor (Hemsworth) and Loki (Hiddleston). Mark Ruffalo also does a great job as super genius/big green rage monster Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk. Chris Evans does a good job as tough, sort-of-super-human-old-guy-but-not- really Steve Rogers/Captain America. Samuel L. Jackson does a great job as smart but tough tactical expert Nick Fury. And finally, Gwyneth Paltrow does a good job as developmental woman/girlfriend of Tony Stark Pepper Potts. All of the other acting was good as well. SPECIAL EFFECTS: Great! All of the special effects combined in the first 45 minutes are better than 10 Syfy movie's special effects. Especially the end sequence. Whoa! I have to hold my horses. OK. The special and visual effects throughout the whole movie were great, and are as good if not better than other Marvel movies, especially the 90's ones. The earlier fights within the air plane carrier plane thing with The Hulk and The Black Widow and Thor and all that stuff and jets and falling through the sky is all great. I also has great special effects in the end battle sequence in Manhattan, New York. DIALOGUE: The dialogue was also great. It was serious, smart, and humorous throughout the movie at just the right times. One of my favorite quotes was from Tony Stark, ""Raise the mizzenmast. Jib the topsails."" This really was a comedy at times. It kept the movie more pleasant than it would have been without it. STORY: The story was overall original, I thought, and I think they probably shouldn't make another one. But that is just my opinion. I give this movie a 9/10 overall because it is funny, realistic special effects-wise, and had great acting.

The seamless blending of individual hero stories into a cohesive team dynamic, a superhero jigsaw puzzle that fits together flawlessly. Weaknesses? Occasionally, the plot might hover on the edge of over-the-top, but hey, it's a superhero extravaganza, and we love it that way. The music, Alan Silvestri's score, is the pulse of heroism, swelling with each iconic entrance and saving the world crescendo. Cinematography captures the grandeur of the Marvel universe, from the soaring heights of Stark Tower to the depths of Loki's mischief. The message? A celebration of teamwork, diversity, and the idea that even the most disparate heroes can come together for the greater good. 8/10 is a superhero salute to its exhilarating entertainment, a film that not only assembles Earth's mightiest heroes but also assembles a solid spot in the pantheon of superhero epics.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

Other reviewers are correct saying that these actors are choice to play these characters. My only complaint is that hey - the 'super' villain Loki was never really very threatening. He was always a sort of weakling in Thor, though interesting. In this movie his only trick is tapping a cane against your chest to control your mind, and being a ruthless jerk, I guess. Scary, practically speaking, but it's not an equal match to four or five movies worth of enemies that we already know the good guys can chew through individually. The bad guy aliens came through the hole in the sky at a rate of about 1 every 3 seconds, kind of trickled through. I'd say we didn't even need the Avengers to dispatch those flying motorcycles - the US Air Force could have handled this whole bunch pretty neatly, though NY would have suffered a bit more. So then why were the Avengers necessary? I dunno, it just seems like the big terrible event that had everyone so worried wasn't that bad.

My one real complaint is that the Hulk, while a ton of comic smashing fun once he does get rolling, is stretched out a bit too long with Banner lamenting his fate and warning to ""not get me angry.""

Having films previously introduced each character, this film still takes the time to give each avenger enough screen time to develop. it's not that they just jump into the idea of being a group of superheroes like there's a lot of debate and argue amongst one another to see if they're even capable of being heroes. The idea of a team of superheroes does not just happen and they have to decide if there capable of it. I need to find that final spark to finally push them. The rivalry between Captain America and Iron Man plays off of polar opposites repelling, one another similar in duality like Batman and Superman both represent different ways of being a hero. Black widow and Hawkeye both agents of shield highly train fighters, tacticians& killers however one thing to be said that Hawkeye being in the control of Loki the majority of the film does not really give you much to go off of the character. Same with Natasha here you don't really know that much about her. Bruce Banner's biggest gripe is that he does not even wanna be here, and he does not want to fight. always though he's forced into situations that he doesn't really have a choice in the matter. His transformation into the hulk is something that's build up to when it finally does finally come it is satisfying. Thor dialogue wise is not the most interest interesting but when he's but when his fighting do come he is magnificent his fight with Tony his fight with hulk and the big finale in New York. The choice of the villain Loki was an appropriate choice not only did Tom Hiddleston bring his mischievous performance from Thor. He uses it well his like charm to pin the avengers against one another. but it's also symbolic given how when the avengers first day debut in the comics the first villain that they faced was Loki. Soundtrack by Alan Silverti has become iconic will go down along side the Danny Elfman Batman and John Williams superman themes. Marvels avengers is a groundbreaking film that paved the pathway to a whole new cinematic universe.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

And, if possible to have a good combination of at least a few of the following elements: > Good script. > Great action scenes. > Fantastic production. > Good actors. > Good acting. > Great sense of humor. > A great music score.

","Joss Whedon's The Avengers is truly one of the best action moves along with a perfect cast for an action picture of which that includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hiddleston, and Scarlet Johannson. With great action sequences, costumes, and special effects, this movie was one of the most groundbreaking visual achievements of 2012. The movie also goes on a par with great MARVEL films such as the Iron Man trilogy, Spider Man's 1 & 2, X-Men, The Incredible Hulk, Ghost Rider, Captain America's 1 & 2 and more.

","Joss Whedon, who has made a name in television, namely for ANGEL (tv, 1999-2004), FIREFLY (tv, 2002-2003), and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (tv, 1996-2003), as well as having written the screenplays of TOY STORY (1995), ALIEN: RESURRECTION (1997), TITAN A.E. (2000), and the concurrently showing CABIN IN THE WOODS (2012), establishes himself as a full-fledged director with a big bang. THE AVENGERS features an array of box office stars, fantastic special effects and tightly-directed action scenes, with a sprinkling of dramatic moments and comedic relief (mostly from Robert Downey Jr's wisecracks and Clark Gregg's gay-like adulation of Chris Evans' character). The major players (Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Incredible Hulk) are introduced briefly but markingly, and from the onset you know Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) has his hands full, bringing together this group of superheroes with flamboyantly clashing personalities. The tesseract, a cosmic cube of debatable origins that has unlimited powers, has been stolen, and Fury assembles the Avengers to retrieve this cube. Villainy is provided deliciously by Tom Hiddleston as Loki, and Gwyneth Paltrow is a welcome addition (from Downey's IRON MAN films) -- as well as Colbie Smulders, making her Marvel film debut as Agent Maria Hill. Only the last third of the film loses steam, with one vaguely wondering why the robots-attack- city scenario is oddly familiar (TRANSFORMERS, anyone?). An ambiguous ending also mars the otherwise energetic proceedings, with Thor accosting his brother Loki back to Asgard. Alan Silvestri's vivid musical score adds to the kinetic frenzy, and Seamus McGarvey's cinematography is impressive. Whedon has crafted a well-crafted action movie with much visceral excitement and an earnest cast.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","The story goes that back in 1961, Martin Goodman, the owner of a struggling comic book company, played a round of golf with one of the owners of DC Comics. The man was doing a bit of boasting of their recent success with their Justice League comic, a revival of the all-star team concept of the Justice Society of the 40s. Goodman went back to his editor and asked for something like it. That editor (Stan Lee)put his head together with the company's best artist (Jack Kirby) and they conceived the Fantastic Four. The stakes were high, as the company was close to going under. It paid off and the Marvel Age of Comics, as Lee liked to call it, had arrived. This hit would spawn more, eventually leading to a true rival for the concept of the Justice League, a team of Marvel all-stars; and the Avengers were born. Throughout the years, the Avengers would be a book of visual flair, action and epic tales. In various hands, the book would feature not just a group of stars, but a real team.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

Captain America at least had a decent story line, you could connect with the character, the same with iron man and the same with the spider man series. This one from the start was just mindless violence, aliens blowing up crap. All super hero movies should have a good story line, a villain who can many shades to their character. That's why Dark Knight was so good not only because the script had some meaning(terrorism, seeing the good versus bad in people) and of course Heath ledger amazing rendition of the Joker.

The storyline is weak, but everyone seems to agree that it isn't the most important element of the film. Its major points are: 1) the action; 2) the relationships between the characters. With regard to the action scenes, I felt nothing but indifference. The main reason is that I can't stand CGI. Everything seems flat and unreal. And The Avengers is a CGI fest. If you like that sort of thing, you'll love it. If you are an old-school action movie lover, you'll probably be bored. As for the relationships between the main characters, I was even more disappointed. Dialogues in the film are just an endless series of supposedly funny jokes. The entire movie plays as very loud and expensive comedy. I can't stand Robert Downey, Jr anymore. Someone had said that he is Tony Stark, but the fact is that Tony Stark is Robert Downey Jr. He's not playing a character, he's just being a wise-ass. Actually, he does it in every movie he's in.

The Hulk here gets his best outing yet as a flaw in the previous two movies was that the Hulk was more likable than Banner and you spent the whole time waiting for him to change. This is not the case in the Avengers where Bruce Banner is just as entertaining and Ruffalo portrays him as hurt but not dull or sullen (as happened in the other movies). He manages to hold his own even with RDJ on screen (no mean feat!). In the film the best of the scenes involve Hulk and Ironman but everyone plays vital roles and no one is superfluous. Although, Tony Stark really does steal every scene and he finally gets to show just what Ironman can do. Ironman gets his best action outing to date!

The action moves along at a pace, the script has some witty moments (the best being the screen operator who turns on his 'Space Invaders' while the Earth is under attack!), Ms Paltrow provides some fleeting eye candy, the CGI is well handled and not too overbearing, and the acting appropriate, eg Samuel L Jackson and Scarlett Johannson (one note actors) provide the well tuned one note performances required of them.

Every hero was at first a sole hero but gradually they ended being a team. Every hero had his own story plus a part in the team. How the team came together was also so heartwarming and how they helped each other. Every hero was greatly portrayed with great graphics, loads of action,comedy,thrill, and a great feast for comic fans and non-comic fans both.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

Vastly entertaining and cunning he is more than a match for our team of heroes. This film introduces the characters and builds them up into team work few the vehicle of Nick Furys shield.

","In the last few Marvel movies ( Iron Man 1 and 2, the Incredible Hulk, Captain America and Thor) was an after-credits scene which referred to this coming movie The Avengers. Small scenes which were just enough to wetten the appetite for the planned movie. Well the movie has arrived here in Europe. Story is simple enough. Loki, adopted brother of Thor has his eyes set on conquering the world and subjugating it's people. ( Freedom is overrated according to Loki) In the first scene he manages to steal something from the very secret S.H.I.E.L.D facility. That's when Nick Fury assembles his dream-team. The earnest Captain America, the one and only Tony Stark a.k.a. Iron Man, Thor himself, Dr Banner ( the Hulk, played by a wonderful, wonderful Mark Ruffalo who's just right for the role) Natasha Romanov and after a short trip to the dark side Hawkeye. Of course there's friction between these strong characters, but in the end they work pretty good together. The Avengers is everything I dreamed of and more. It's big on action, no doubt about it. It looks plain awesome. It's never boring. The chemistry between the actors is obvious and at times the movie is very funny. ( the way the Hulk fights Loki had me almost wetting my pants) It's serious when it needs to be..and when I left the movietheatre I had a big smile on my face. That doesn't happen to me that often.

However, if you are looking for something that speaks to your soul, entertains, shocks, and leaves you with an unyielding catharsis, then forget about it. The Avengers was rated in three fields; cinematography, story structure (plot & theme), and characterization. Of these, it ranked highest in cinematography and store structure, although it ranked fairly evenly in all three – a balanced and organized film. However, it lack focus and import regarding the theme, and the plethora of characters makes it difficult for the audience to connect with their trials.

","Personally, I prefer superhero soloists to superhero teams, perhaps because it is easier to delve into and devote more time to a single superhero's characteristics, psychological motivations, and objectives. Also, I think, by their very nature, superheroes tend to be defiant, isolated loners - they are different from, and surpass the abilities of, common people. Therefore, I was particularly pleased by director Joss Whedon's triple accomplishment in ""The Avengers"". He faced the challenge of plausibly uniting, and coalescing several different actors with different acting qualities - especially when only one of them, Robert Downey, Jr. as Iron Man, has any national recognizability (no knock against the rest of the ensemble group, of course). Whedon faced the challenge of combining and meshing several wildly disparate superheroes resolutely used to being ""lone wolves"" and functioning solo. Finally, Whedon faced the challenge of giving each hero equal substantial time to strut their stuff in the spotlight, even the deceptively ordinary, non-superpowered Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner).

","First off, I'd like to say that The Avengers was a GOOD movie. However, it was hyped up way too much, and after reading some review online, I think I know what my problem with it was. A lot of people are calling The Avengers the anti-Dark Knight. While I agree that these two movies are completely different, they are easily compared, and The Dark Knight wins by a mile. I was never really into comic books, but Batman has one of my favorites anyway. After seeing The Avengers, my only favorite was Iron Man, and only because of his own movie and, of course, Robert Downey Jr.. But getting to the point, the Avengers hardly had a plot. It was by far the coolest movie I have seen a while, but some of the things were just too annoying to get past. First: Transformers 3 much? Next: Many people say that Tom Hiddleston was fantastic as Loki. Maybe I wasn't watching the same movie, because he seemed to act without motivation and, indeed, a bit shallowly. Before being defeated, he reveals everything to the Black Widow, one who has clearly revealed her ploy already. For being a guy powerful enough to bring a massive army from another planet, he, and his army, were sure beaten pretty easily.

","The avenger is a critical movie for the superhero genre in general. And hasn't aged poorly at all, despite being released 10 years ago. The movie may be simple, but its simplicity became a core to hold the foundation of superhero films. From the action, different character interactions, and even a little bit of light-hearted comedy. But since this was the first time the Avengers were meeting, simplicity was really what the movie needed. The film emphasized the chemistry each character had in the movie more than you expected. This was a great plan so you can fully see the Avengers as a real team. This movie is meant for the entire family to watch, and the film has excellent replay value.

","The amount of hype and praise this movie has gotten is out of hand. It's simply a blockbuster action-movie with superheroes. The plot is easy to follow; bad man wants to take over the Earth for some reason, gets help from aliens to do this, superheroes stop him/them. Of course, this is a bit general, and yes I know the names etc of all these people (beings?). Having had separate movies for many of these heroes (Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, The Incredible Hulk), we know these superheroes, their character and motives if you will. Not all the audience will have seen the previous movies, but it's not exactly a difficult story to follow, and we have seen the same plot 10000 times before, in different variations and in different mediums (books, comic-books, films etc).",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","Iron Man. The Incredible Hulk. Iron Man 2. Thor. Captain America: The First Avenger. The Avengers is the ultimate culmination of all those movies, which ranged in quality from slightly above-average to excellent. In my review of the first Iron Man, I called it the pinnacle of Marvel cinema. It has now been topped. The story goes that after Captain America, the Tesseract ended up at the bottom of the ocean, and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and S.H.I.E.L.D. pulled it out. Now Loki (Tom Hiddleston) wants it, due to its inherently unlimited power, which will give him the ability to rule with an iron fist over all of Earth. Unless the Avengers can get past their differences and stop him. I have recently come to the opinion that director and screenplay heavily influence acting (this may be a bit late to realize this, but whatever). It certainly seems to be true in this case. Joss Whedon is apparently great fun to work with, and his writing talent is well-known. Both of these might be reasons why each actor performs better in this movie than in previous Marvel films. The highlights are Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., and Mark Ruffalo, each playing characters with hidden emotional depth that boils to the surface in the most commendable of ways (especially the latter actor, for obvious reasons). Though this trio leads the pack, said pack is composed entirely of very strong performances, something not usually seen in ensembles, but which Whedon pulls together with the greatest of ease. Joss Whedon originally signed on for this project in April of 2010. He threw out former writer Zak Penn's screenplay and replaced it with his own. No disrespect to Mr. Penn, but I sincerely doubt his version was better-written than this. Whedon's script shines brightly in nearly every conversation, each one punctuated with his trademark, never-miss humor. Another thing he is known for is the characterization he imbues his writing with. From Buffy to The Cabin in the Woods, Whedon has never created a character that is anything less than compelling, a rule that still applies, even to a cast as large and star-studded as this. Interestingly (and wisely), this doesn't feel like Joss Whedon's The Avengers. This really does feel like Marvel's The Avengers, with Joss's cherry on top. The characters still match perfectly with their prevous cinematic versions. The character development is so strong, in fact, that in battle, none of the characters feel like more superpowered thugs; they are actual people, fighting for their lives and humanity. Of course, superhero movies aren't usually known for their characters. The special effects department really outdoes itself in this film. From the nether regions of outer space to the showdown between Iron Man and Thor, visually the film never fails to dazzle. The action sequences are filmed and edited with a sort of grace, with Whedon's signature shaky-cam and midshot zooms thrown in occasionally for good measure. Unlike most movies, the action scenes are not edited in quick shots. The camera rotates around our heroes as they kick extraterrestrial ass, and various other techniques are employed to keep action shots as long as possible. Though unconventional, this ensures that the action is just as absorbing as the dialogue, and works well to this effect, allowing both of those aspects to support each other. This attribute is extremely hard to come by in movies, but where you can find it, treasure it. Upon leaving this film (which I only did after the final credits had rolled), many of those leaving with me were laughing and talking animatedly about this film, recalling various scenes and how the quality fared in relation to other comic book films. My opinion is that this is the second-greatest one of the bunch, second only to The Dark Knight (story and thematic depth beat witty banter and numerous explosions any day). However, for those simply looking to be entertained, right now, you simply can't do any better than this.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","By the time this review is up, most of us have already seen this movietwice. The Avengers hulk-smashed all box-office records and will undoubtedly become one of the most successful movies of all time – and it should. The Avengers successfully brings together separate Marvel heroes (and their franchises) by refusing to be overburdened with their separate backgrounds and character arcs. The main plot concerns Thor's divine brother Loki, who was defeated in Thor and is now in the service of some alien priest-thing (known as the Other) who promises Loki an army of unbeatable alien warriors with which he can become ruler of Earth. In exchange, Loki must give him the Tesseract, a cube which is an endless source of energy. Simple end-of-the-world type stuff, right? The movie has an infectious enthusiasm about its opportunity to put so many heroes in one film, and this makes seeing each character in action fun in a giddy, comic-book geek kind of way. Who needs to see Captain America cry over lost love when we can have the Hulk pummel a god of Asgard through five different layers of concrete! What are these aliens and why are they here? Who cares!

The presence of the evil villain merely serves as a means to an end; in this case the end being the assembly of the Avengers, an event the previous films have all been leaving up to.

1384,26 April 2012,e5312,7," A great merge of many great movies
","As many, I have been waiting for this film since ages. As I was quite fond of all the previous Avenger movies, I obviously had great expectations, some were fulfilled and some were not. The movie started quite thrilling. Bringing in the Chitauri was brilliant, I kinda wish they would have got a bigger part in the story than just being the bad-ass alien army to defeat. But of course, as the film had so many things to expand it would have been a little bit too much. And that was quite the bad point in the movie, even though I was expecting it to happen. With so many main characters and with all their background stories, there was not enough time to unfold everything that was behind the story. By that I mean, some of the characters were not even near as complex as in the previous movies. For example, I think Thor turned out to be pretty one-sided in this film. I really liked the movie Thor and while it was obvious that most characters were not going to be in this one, I still missed Hopkins, Portman and Dennings, mostly because the character of Thor was more like the angry prince like in the beginning of the movie Thor, rather than the wise king he had became in the end of it. Another problem the amount of characters brought up was that the movie was a bit too fast. Unlike the calmer nature of the original films, in this one there was always something happening, mostly fight scenes. I love fight scenes and usually enjoy them to the most, but only with a fine balance of them and calmer moments. Of course in short terms, it was very amazing and exciting, but when it came to the death scene of Coulson, as Fury sat next to him in silence had I only realized how tired one can get of seeing almost nothing but battles for an entire movie. Yet, as I've said before, with so many characters making this film calmer would have been simply impossible. The acting otherwise was really nice, the crew seemed to do their best during the whole film. Smulders was a pleasant surprise, she was truly marvelous in the role of Agent Hill. Ruffalo was just as well a good exchange of Norton, he made the character of Bruce Banner very likable. The scores also did catch up to the spirit of the film pretty well, the music kept you in the mood during the whole time. As for the amazing sides of the film, the visuals were utterly cutting-edge. 3D effects were not that outstanding though, guess it still does not really worth the headache. For a sequel (as I hope one will happen in the near future), I just hope that they will have more space and time to expand the characters' personalities a bit more precisely. As for the first film to merge all these stories, I don't think they could have done any better. Maybe not the best directing nor the best superhero movie of all time, but for sure is a fun film to watch with many great moments and good acting. A must-see for all Marvel fans.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","Before I saw avengers I was expecting to see a action heavy film with little or no script. And now that i have seen it I can say that i was very surprised by the dialogues and the script. The script was witty, smart and well written. The main plot was of course simple, that of a man( in this case a God) wanting to take over the world, but apart from that cliché plot point the script was very good. It was more character based than plot based. The movie gave enough individual time to the heroes(other than hawkeye) in terms of screen time. The point of the film was a team assembling and that team dynamic was brilliantly written and acted. The heroes fought, they disagreed, they had different opinions to things, they had different reasons to go to war, but at the end despite their differences they came together. This team dynamic was brilliantly handled by Joss Whedon. The script was funny at times as well, Joss whedon knew that the avengers wasn't supposed to be a dark knight, it wasn't supposed to be realistic and gritty and scattered with various themes, so instead of making a mindless michael bay film he added his own unique touches which gave the movie and the characters depth while also preserving the summer blockbuster flavour. Each character played a specific part in this team, captain America played the loyal/bound by duty super soldier who turns out to be a brilliant tactician as well. Iron man provided the team with flying abilities and brilliant weaponry, thor had personal reasons to fight this battle, while HULK well he was an unstoppable monster!

","The movie starts off slow while the plot takes shape and everyone is brought up to speed on the threat the Earth will soon face. A little too much time is spent with the 'peripheral' characters; black widow, Hawkman and Fury but from the moment that one of the key protagonists first goes toe to toe with Loki, the film picks up pace. What follows is entertaining but I think keener fans of the marvel universe will feel the middle of the film comes just short of delivering expectations. For example a fight match-up that was mean't for the big-screen including two of the most powerful of the entourage left me asking for more. All is forgiven though as the action gets better and better throughout and by then end when you think you've seen the finale it just keeps going. The last 30 minutes of the film is the best of any superhero flick to date though I do wonder if the budget for CGI could have been spread across the earlier parts of the film less thinly. The humor throughout is hilarious though at moments it risks taking the material not seriously enough as though the cameras stopped rolling and everyone can stop pretending to be superheroes. One of the heroes is the butt of the joke more often than fair and doesn't get so many memorable lines or opportunities to show off like the others so if you happened to pick this one as a favorite you might be a little disappointed if not for the fact that the others in the entourage do kick so much ass.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

I really didn't think this movie would've'e been as good as it was without Iron Man, Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor, and Captain America. So I loved everything about this movie:Acting, action, plot, special effects. The only problem I personally had was just that hulk wasn't in it as much as I wanted. But when he was there it was just epic. Also that the hulk really reminded me of a a gorilla at the end of the movie which i found just funny. But other than that I can ignore the fact that Odin just sent Thor to earth, the Chintari just dying after the mother ship blew up, and the excessive comedic relief. I found it quite strange that the world was in danger of being taken over and all the characters took it so lightly and making jokes.

","Being the comic book junkie that I am, and seeing numerous attempts at making decent super hero/vigil-anti films, most of which ending in disaster. From the terrible 'Fantastic Four' films to the ridiculously awful 'Thor' film, there was no doubt in my mind that the film would lack any real substance, but instead focus on immature, repetitive, one- liners. My only true incentive for paying to see this in theaters was Joss Whedon being the writer and director. That being said I enjoyed the 'Iron Man,' 'Captain America,' and 'Hulk' films as well. My expectations were low for this ensemble super hero flick, as I sat in the back row of the movie theater. It was surprisingly very good. it was well written(for the most part), the acting was superb, the plot was juicy and consistent, the characters were believable, and the CGI and other effects were great. The film had many one liners, but they were mature, well thought out, humorous, and best of all: the film didn't rely on them to make itself memorable.Aside from the over the top Thor and Loki characters, and far too fast progressing beginning the film was excellent. The film began very fast, and then suddenly slowed down which was a slight bit annoying.

","Clippy, extremely lore-crammed launch of the first major big-screen Marvel Comics teamup goes a little too much into the anime-type features and weaponry of the SHIELD spy agency and its monochromatic personnel during its first half but soon settles into a huge yet decently Medea-theme-motivated exploration of the superhero identity, and an occasionally funny action film based upon several evolving lines of the comic characters' histories (non-readers who know little if anything of the arcane intricacies of the Marvel Amazing Fantasy/Strange Tales/Tales of Suspense/Ultimate Avengers lines will find this a bit of a slog) as SHIELD's eyepatched lead agent Nick Fury's agency's base is invaded by the Norse god/trickster, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who steals a new intergalactic energy cube called the Tessaract for the invading alien race called the Chitauri. Fury, with the help of the slinky, red-headed Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) organizes the participation of a small group of terrrestrials/magnates/scientists better known as the Hulk (a pleasantly-greyed Mark Ruffalo)/Iron Man/Thor (the sturdy Chris Hemsworth)/Captain America a.k.a. the Avengers, who recently had a variety of individual adventures but are now needed to defeat Loki and send the Chitauri back to their interdimensional plane. The film's unexplained, insistently locale-centered structuring—weaving from a destroyed SHIELD hidden land base to their floating battleship called a helicarrier, where the Avengers collect and argue their theories—seems almost at cross-purposes at times from the charmingly insultive, rowdy, obdurate band of costumed characters getting some help from the crunching sound-effects and punchy yet glacial camera-work. Director Joss Whedon is not David Lean or even Superman I's Richard Donner (he doesn't seem to know how to subtly build grand and stacked sequences or use scale into centered release points for the audience to invite them into constant rousing applause for these 'heroes'). But Whedon does evoke a non-cynical appreciation of these characters minds (Chris Evans' Captain America is as much a straight shooter as straight arrow) and hearts (Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark/cardiac-wounded Iron Man probably comes off the most believable considering he had two full screen adventures of his own, yet the character's mogulistic resources—enough to bankrupt several continents—beggar the question as to why he would need SHIELD at all instead of starting his own superhero gang), and their clear-cut stagings and streaking, powerful choreography even during the most complicated effects scenes does make the appropriate impact. Once the Avengers assemble to defend New York City against a final invasion of giant slug-like creatures and Chitauri attackers THE AVENGERS illustrates the dichotomy of current genre epics, written for tween or undiscriminating audiences yet grandly casting decently talented actors in noble roles for the staying power of a halfway legitimate drama, and settling for digital-image glorification of a superhero costume instead.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","If you like your typical action packed superhero movie, The Avengers is the perfect movie. It has action, suspense, and humor with a touch of romance thrown in. It has amazing heroes, a great villain, fighting scenes, a rivalry between hero and villain, and an all-star cast. What it lacks, is originality. All superhero movies are the same, the world has been threatened in some way and a superhero must rise to the occasion to overcome the threat. The ongoing battle between good and evil, which isn't any different in this movie. What makes The Avengers different from other superhero movies is the compilation of characters. The world has been threatened once again and we need Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), to come together and save us, as Thor's brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) plans to use a glowing cube called the Tesseract to open a portal bringing an evil alien army to Earth to help takeover. We have beat Loki before in the movie Thor, now he is back with a vengeance. Unfortunately if you have not seen these movies you will need to catch up as there is not a lot of back story on why these heroes were chosen. With everything going on you do not really get to understand the characters, especially why Loki wants to control the world. Even if you haven't seen them you know what to expect and can understand the basic storyline. There are no surprises, you can plot out the movie before you even watch it. Overall, I found the movie to be exiting, but explored way too many times. The whole idea of needing a superhero to come save us has been done before. Originality is what makes a movie great. Director Joss Whedon did a great job compiling different characters together into one movie. Even with amazing special effects and compelling characters, I believe he could have made a better storyline with more surprises. We should be walking away thinking, ""Wow, I did not expect that to happen!"" The world will continue to want heroes in their lives. In movies like The Avengers, we are given hope that good will always overcome evil. Which is why I'm sure they will be coming out with another one soon.

You know, a good bad guy should 'scare' you in a way, makes you wonder what he's capable of doing, but it fell flat tho. As for the avengers team, we'll have a glimpse of their pasts. I appreciate the director's effort to keep each of their own personality in a way while building the story, but the way it was told just plain. I know there are so many characters in this movie, but come on, no need too much conversation to show their egos, how bout on body language a.k.a act... it was boring :( I enjoyed the last 40 minutes, but the rest, oh please... I giggled a bit but there is not much to remember apart from Hulk and Hawkeye's arms really. We know how a superhero movie gonna end, but surprising storyline won't be much to ask no?",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","The Avengers : As Thor's hammer smashes the ground causing huge ripples in the earth, The Avengers' smashing action blows your mind as it leaves a deep impact on you, way after the film is over. One of the most awaited films of the year, The Avengers is everything you'd expect from a awesome superhero- get-together film. After Loki steals the infinitely powerful Tesseract from Nick Fury, the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. puts together the group that he's had in the works for years. Gathering Iron Man, The Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow, the team of ""The Avengers"" takes on Loki and his army to save the world. The Avengers does not fall short of anything. Stunts, story, performances, humour, just everything in the right proportion. Humour is in abundance but no way does it make the film spoof-like. You feel for the characters, which makes the film a roller coaster ride you don't want to miss out on! Do not compare it to The Dark Knight - Nolan's Batman movies, there is nothing dark or twisted about The Avengers, it's a feel-good fun film.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","When this movie was first about to hit theatres, I won tickets to go to see the advance preview. Unfortunately/fortunately, I choose the latter, I was not able to attend as I wasn't in the region of the preview at the time....THANK GOD! because if I had had a whole days sleep, woke up and attended this movie I still would have fallen asleep watching this drivel. I have attempted, and I emphasis the word attempted, to watch this movie three times before I was able to watch it in full finally after a fourth attempt. I fail to see how this movie scored so damn high....I could literally put a bunch of chimps into a room and they could write a script at the absolute least two times better than this movie. I could also think of more fun activities to do instead of watching this, for example: stabbing two pencils into my eyes and moving them around for the duration of this film....exaggerated....yeah well so is this film and the hype that surrounds it. Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate Joss Whedon and his works e.g. Buffy (Brilliant) and Dollhouse (inspired) but this movie was an absolute miss, why people rave and rate this movie good baffles me (I had to say this again because I just can't work it out). No character development, and yes I get that you don't really need that as they all have their own individual movies (so I recommend just watching them) and why put the black widow in here, did she even use powers?? all I saw was her using pistols, was she supposed to appeal and be empowering to the female audience?? cause if so I missed that memo, and the fact that there was so much CGI use they don't need that, they are superheroes for Pete's sake SUPERHEROES! and don't even get me started on the amount of fighting, yay fun, its an action, but some was just pointless, where on earth do I even need to put any thought into this movie let alone see what the heck is going on cause the explosions and gunshots are so distracting, I think I have literally put more thought into writing this review than the amount of thought running through my mind whilst watching this movie. Pretty sure my IQ dropped even knowing about, let alone attempting to watch it this many times. What can I say, I'm a trier. I'm giving this movie a 1/10 I would give it a zero but I felt the scene at the very end of the credits when all the heroes are sitting in the diner with the bored tired looks on their faces depicted exactly how I felt after watching this movie.

The heroes are, in case you don't already know, are Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and they're all brought together as a team by Nick Fury (Samuel L.

","After an excruciating four year wait (the scene after the credits of 2008's Iron Man with Jackson set the Internet alight) and five films leading to this massive point, Avengers Assemble is here. This film is the cinematic peak of 2012. So much time, effort, spoilers, Comic-Con appearances and millions of other components have been put into this picture. It is a Marvel fan boy's nirvana, an action fan's expectation fulfiller and only a foetus could dislike the whole of this film. Expertly written and beautifully acted out, complete with the best special effects EVER makes Avengers Assemble not just a film to watch once or twice. It's a film to watch until your disc player explodes. Every single character gets their chance to shine and they play out well. And although Hawkeye and Black Widow (Renner and Johansson) haven't had their own films (Hawkeye had a brief cameo in Thor; Black Widow had a more obvious involvement in Iron Man 2), they are just as great as Captain America and Iron Man. Avengers Assemble- you'd be a fool to miss it. OVERALL: One of the best films of the millennium.

","I've been waiting for this movie since i was a kid reading Avengers #177 where they're all defeated by Michael/Korvac, and thinking, ""hang on, they're not supposed to be ALL defeated!"" I was hooked on these guys since then. 1978 i think.Anyway, i was more than worried about this film because it was to be very much MY film! I'd invested a lot of myself in these characters. I wouldn't be at all pleased if it didn't live up how awesome i know these characters have been written over the years. The battles, scars and losses they've had to endure. I thought it was going to be a kid flick! Pure and simple. That it wouldn't round the character's personalities enough, and the script would be too simple. Plus Joss Whedon WAS under my radar as a director. I hadn't gotten into Buffy or Firefly and anyway, let's just say i wasn't overly keen on the director. Nothing personal, or derivative of his craft and skills, but this was a boyhood dream taking form. People i spoke with about it all rated him though. So, as per usual i tried to keep away from as many clips, interviews, rumours etc as possible. I like to go into the show knowing as little as possible. I only watched trailers. Anyway, i went to see it in 2D on Wednesday 25th with a friend. Full of expectation and dread, heheh. All i can say is, Whedon has made an Avengers movie we fans can be so proud of. The Dark Knight for me is a monumental film, and easily was the best supe movie project ever executed. Until now that is. THE best supe team is now all together in a live action film. And they have been drawn together beautifully by Whedon's script. The mind boggles as to who else they will bring into this universe. Respect is due to the research, and his interpretation of how these characters work together. He nailed it. I'm not sure anyone else would have. Maybe not even Nolan himself! Whedon's view of them was almost exactly how i have interpreted their relationships over the years. I've seen The Avengers twice now already, and will probably go again before the Bluray release. That will be an occasion too, i'm sure. I've got to give the score a mention too. It's on repeat in my headphones at the moment, because its bloody great! You hardly notice it during the film because of the awesome visuals and dialogue, but i recommend having a listen to it alone. Alan Silvestri is a master of action cinema. He did Predator for god's sake! He delivers royally here. Check it out. I couldn't be happier about The Avengers. When Iron Man came out Downey-Junior was perfectly cast, and to top it all, a great movie was made, i thought maybe it could be the time when a really cool Avengers movie would be made.

","The Avengers have been Assembled, and with great success. Marvel did all the forework flawlessly, all the Superhero movies leading to this 1 make sense now, small bits in those movies are directly or indirectly tied to this one. The Director / Writer: Joss Whedon - did a great job with all the characters, he took some bits out of the old movies and connected the dots, brought out the best in each and all of the characters. The Cast: Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) - he was / is and will be the best choice to play IronMan, he just takes the character to a new level. Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) - was great in Captain America, is absolutely great in this one, i feel like he can play any superhero, he is just the superhero ,,type,, I liked the old costume a bit better but this does not stop the Cap. being the Cap. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) - The God of Thunder...what about that, he feels like the God of Thunder this time, his swing got meaner ( since his ,,Solo Movie,, ) and he swings a lot. Hulk/Bruce Banner ( Mark Ruffalo ) - The unstoppable Force / the Green Rage Monster - oh my: what can i say here - Mark Ruffalo is the best HULK, he ties the absolute HULK: TV's Lou Ferrigno, who gives his voice to the big guy this time ( as he did in all HULK ,,Solo,, movies ). CGI work on HULK is absolutely Fantastic. I feel that Ruffalo plays the clumsy but genius professor Banner better than the others before him ( Eric Bana / Edward Norton ) and this time THE HULK can SMAAAASH ( 4 real ). Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) is a nice addition to the Avengers Team ( he had a short appearance in THOR before ), i feel that he is a bit of an outsider in this one, maybe not that much screen time, but overall he just fits in nicely. Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) finally we get a peek in her story outside of the Avengers, she does that catlike fighting that we loved in IronMAn 2, she has some psychologically gripping moments in this one that i loved even more than the fight scenes, nicely done. Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury has a dominating presence in this one - we finally see the mastermind / spy / agent finally in work, and he works his ,,magic,, well. Clark Gregg as Agent Caulson is back and he brings not only the comic character but the bad-ass Agent with a ,,punch,,. A nice addition is Cobie Smulders as Agent Maria Hill. Last but not least: Tom Hiddleston as Loki the main villain - Thor's brother ( ,,he's adopted,, ) - He is the absolute villain, played so amazingly by Middleston that he levels the the other characters in each and every aspect, he just balances the movie out - some of his scenes are fantastic.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","Iron Man should be constantly bullying Captain America. It makes no sense that he doesn't. Iron Man briefly mentions that Cap's powers ""came out of a bottle."" Of his dad's. That's all. It would make perfect sense, if Iron Man distracted, ignored and patronised Cap at all times, especially during emergencies. Iron Man per movies 1 and 2 submits to all athorities he ever meets (except baddies, but they aren't authorities). If he doesn't bully, he'll start sleeping bad. Not bullying isn't normal from Iron Man's perspective: Cap is someone everyone wants to be best buddies with. But not a superhero like Iron Man or Thor. That should worry Iron Man in particular. Besides, Iron Man needs no buddies, he is behind armor 90% of the time. On top, he is a self-confessed non-moralist. As a result, Cap should be Iron Man's bullying victim 2 seconds after they meet, and this would never end, as long as Fury puts them in the same team.

I can't actually say anything is particularly bad except maybe The Hawk, I've nothing against the actor but his skills with the arrow seemed a bit out of place with the others. He was like Legolas without the blonde wig. Speaking of blonde's, you could tell the film was done by Joss Whedon as the dialogue was interspersed with quick one liners and the banter between the team was funny (the best bit though was probably when no words were used at all between Hulk and Thor). It must have been difficult to mesh all the characters together and give each of the stars enough screen time to keep them happy. Overall, it's not as good as the Dark Knight but its not meant to be as dark and serious as that, the Dark Knight is a cartoon/comic book character pretending to be a proper film star, the Avengers has film stars pretending to be cartoon/comic book characters and it never takes itself too seriously so is fun to watch.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

I was also worried about the casting of captain America, i was afraid that he would ruin the entire movie for me if he wasn't given good lines and action sequences. But i had faith in Joss Whedon having been a fan of the firefly, i believed if anyone could make the avengers it would be him...........and he did! The movie was a complete both in pleasing the viewers and the an earning millions of dollars profit. Already it has beaten harry potter DH part 2 and Avatar in both opening nights and weekends and box office records. Alright now to the movie itself. The acting was fabulous in most parts, Robert Downey doing showing us once again what a great choice it was to cast him as Ironman, delivering hilarious lies and portraying tony stark brilliantly. Chris Hemsworth, loved him. Not much credit goes to this young star but i think he does Thor brilliantly. Mark Ruffalo was great as the roll of Bruce banner, though i probably prefer Ed Norton, the lines were specifically chosen to fit Mark Ruffalo(Thanks to Joss Whedon). The hulk itself was quite cool, though at parts looked fake was a good CGI impersonation of mark Ruffalo, the hulk was sensational character and hilarious at parts as well. Tom Hiddleston, the villain Loki, was sensational as well. He was a well crafted villain from the start, though i wish at some parts they made more of a confident bad guy who feared nothing rather than a crazy villain at parts. Chris Evans, finally came into the roll of captain America( due to good lines and development of his character. The other characters fitted in there part not overly special though. OK fight scenes, wonderfully crafted and directed. Hulk vs Thor was an epic fight scene which it should have been having the two most powerful marvel characters in a fight against each other. The Thor vs Ironman was very good except that Ironman would not stand a chance against Thor in the comics, However nothing compares to the action sequence at the end, with this epic action scene comes some cool and lines and comedy moments the avengers must defend the city against an alien attack. beautifully directed again and incredible graphics come together to make this awesome fight which was one of the best action sequences iv seen.

","Positives: *The movie looks awesome, CGI is unobtrusive and the costumes look almost exactly like the comics. *Traditional but well told superhero blockbuster story, putting Michael Bay to absolute shame, simply by focusing on the avengers and not some lame characters no one cares about. *Every superhero acts like they should (except maybe Hawkeye, but he's the only one I don't know from comics) *Rescued the hulk from the absolute pits of the last two movies made about him and Mark Ruffalo made him the best part of the whole movie by far. *A satisfying conclusion with a very surprising (and exciting) reveal after the credits.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","Starring Robert Downey Jr., Samuel L. Jackson, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans. Directed by Joss Whedon. 140 minutes. Opens midnight Thursday at major theaters. PG Agent Phil Coulson will love The Avengers. You surely will, too, if you recognize his name. Officious but lovable S.H.I.E.L.D. sleuth Phil is one of many Marvel Comics minions Joss Whedon summons to his energizing superhero adventure, making this first blockbuster of summer 2012 something of a geek drill. It helps if you go to the film having already seen the two Iron Man movies, plus Thor, The Incredible Hulk and Captain America: The First Avenger, all released between 2008-11 and leading up to this ensemble nerdgasm. But you don't have to sport a propeller beanie to enjoy The Avengers, and this may be the highest possible praise for what director Whedon and his co-writer Zak Penn have wrought. They've cannily crafted a saga guaranteed to pass muster with the Comic- Con cognoscenti, without forsaking regular popcorn munchers who just hope to see the planet get saved with maximum firepower and a few laughs. Whether you love or merely like The Avengers, it will likely all come down to the performances and not the perfunctory plot or the on-the-fly back story. You don't need to know Agent Phil's connection to the Marvel multi verse to appreciate Clark Gregg's expanded and surprisingly emotive take on him here, as a combination of fusspot and fan boy. And past knowledge of two iffy Hulk movies isn't required to marvel at the nuances that newcomer Mark Ruffalo brings to the green-skinned beast, even though ""the other guy"" within mild-mannered Dr. Bruce Banner isn't revealed until the 80-minute mark of this 140-minute bladder test.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","A movie some four years in the making, from the post-credit teaser of 2008's excellent Iron Man and 2010 sequel, through last year's equally impressive though very different Thor and Captain America movies. The weight of expectation is often a tough one to bear, with the question being could the bringing together of these stories and characters hope to equal the sum of the parts? As a long time comic book fan I would have to say the answer is a resounding ""yes"". In fairness I did have good reason to hope - Joss Whedon is a long time Marvel comics writer, and his speciality is ensemble characters. As with the highly successful Buffy and Angel franchises he has a talent for gel'ing an aparrently incongruous group - exploring the conflicts between the characters with humour to bring them together. Even the relatively underdeveloped characters - Mark Ruffalo as the new Banner / Hulk, Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye, and Scarlett Johanssen's Black Widow are fleshed out and given fair screen time, each essential to the plot in their own way. Nick Fury and his team of Shield agents also play their part, while Tom Hiddleston's return as the arrogant demi-god Loki provides ample threat, with the feeling of something darker lurking in the wings - make sure you wait for the inevitable post-credit teaser for a clue as to what. True, the movie does rely heavily on super-powered set pieces, from the clashes of egos (and fists, hammers, shields and repulsors) within the group to the incredible city-wrecking finale, but what else would you expect or hope from in a movie like this?

The story to this movie was the way it should be and making Loki the villain in this movie was the perfect choice. This has got to be one of the best action movies in history. It was also pretty hilarious watching all the reactions the hulk made to all the characters,especially when he grabbed Loki and tossed him like a rag doll.I think iron man was the most exciting thing about this movie. If you watch the extra ending of the movie you will find out that Thanos might appear in the avengers 2 that is coming out in 2015. It will also have you looking forward to the guardians of the galaxy movie coming out in 2014. Overall its an awesome movie.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

Joss Whedon combined the two best genres: action and comedy and he made an epic movie out of it. The type cast was relatively good. My favourite character has to be Iron Man as of all his gadgets. It was very clever how it began with the Avengers hating one another and then they had to put aside their differences and avenge humanity. In my opinion, the best part was the Battle of New York. I loved how everything flowed from one hero to another. It was action packed and the film had a great climax. It was awesome how in the credits, Thanos revealed himself.

","Before I review this title, I want to explain why there are so many bad reviews about this film. A lot of people don't know the back story of any of these superheroes, hydra, the tesseract (also known as the cosmic cube), Loki, or the avengers themselves. Joss did not have the time to explain all of this in pretty much expected people to already know about these things. That being said, for the people who are avid fans and know the story, you will love this movie. It is obvious that Joss is a fan of this series and loved making this movie. Everything in it screamed comic book Avengers. Even the Stan Lee inspired underlying theme of what it means to be a hero is prevalent when Iron Man learns that suits and power aren't what makes you a hero, but the willingness to act and sacrifice for others is what truly makes you a hero. I think a lot of people missed this, but this is what comic books are all about and that is why this film is magical. As for the CGI it was amazing and necessary in order to make this film. Wires would not have cut it in this case, no pun intended. This is the movie all of us geeks have been waiting for. Every character was spot on except for maybe Hawkeye and Fury, but I can overlook that. The small details were amazing, for example, the Hulk cannot lift Thor's hammer and Captain America never kills anyone with a gun (although he will use one to keep people at bay until he gets his shield back). This movie is important to comic book aficionados everywhere because we finally have one that was done right.

I found myself feeling hugely impressed at the skill set and technology of the shield operatives, then completely sorry for them when they are thrust into the world of the Avengers. The Avengers themselves were pitched at a power level far greater than set up in the preceding movies, but they were only the better for it. The speed of the impacts, the level of catastrophic damage that they leave in their wake... all perfect. The only missed opportunity I felt was for Captain America... still too much of the poster boy soldier, and not enough of the Captain, except when he is dealing with shield agents, or policemen... and I still wanted the Captain to move more like Bronski did in the Hulk. Thor is definitely a God in this, and the Hulk is definitely a poorly guided atomic bomb.

1609,21 May 2012,NPThirteen,10," Marvel Avengers Assemble (12A)
","In 2008, we were treated to a post-credits scene at the end of Iron Man, featuring Samuel L. Jackson making his first appearance as S.H.I.E.L.D. leader, Nick Fury. This small, minute long clip confirmed one thing; an Avengers movie was happening. So here we are. Four years, five films and one name change later, we have Avengers Assemble. So: was it worth the wait? In short; yes. Now, you'd think that in a film with so many big stars that some of them would end up being sent to the sidelines, but every single character gets their moment to shine. The only person that does feel a little underused is Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye, but given his role in the story, it's understandable, and he still makes an impact. He could certainly give Katniss Everdeen a run for her money. The Hulk hasn't really had much luck when it comes to the big screen, currently on his third actor in just under ten years, but Joss Whedon and Mark Ruffalo have managed to bring the Hulk to the big screen in possibly the best way possible, and it's mostly all down to Ruffalo's damn good acting. He's the first actor to portray both Banner AND the ""Other Guy"" in the same film, and that's a major benefit to have the Hulk actually look like his human counterpart this time, whereas the versions from Ang Lee's 2003 Hulk and Louis Leterrier's 2008 The Incredible Hulk were both just a big, green CGI mess. Alas, there are some downsides to every film, and Avengers Assemble is no exception. The opening pre-credits scene does feel a little unsure, and the middle act drags a little bit. It was entertaining, but I did find myself wondering how long they were going to spend on the Helicarrier before something interesting happened. Finally, I arrive at the 3D. It wasn't particularly that impressive if I'm honest. I stopped noticing it after about twenty minutes (though that probably proves just how good the film was) apart from in a select few scenes, and even then, the screen is too jumbled. Every time you blink, your eyes need to re-adjust to the image, and it becomes blurry. I'd say that, if you have the extra money, go for 3D, but if you opt for a 2D viewing, you won't miss much, and you'll save some money! Apart from the minor niggles, a pretty much perfect film. *****",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

I've read maybe 10 Avengers books ever (most of which were the Ultimates) so I went into this less a 'fanboy' and more someone who loves movies, and has like many been wildly intrigued by this new attempt at cinematic world building that truly HASN'T been done before, not a franchise, a whole WORLD, that never has to be rebooted because once established, the stories that can be told within this, let's face it, wildly profitable world are near limitless in variations past typical sequels. Something happened at the end of Iron Man, at the time it seemed to many like a really fun aside, but many took it as a promise. A promise to fans and film-goers alike that marvel was greasing the wheels for something really special, and come hell or high water, they were going to find a way to make the impossible happen.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","No twists or difficult to follow plots, this movie was easy watching from start to very end. Obviously the idea is used million times before (evil declares war on world, heroes try to stop them, evil seems to be winning, government decides to nuke the evil and sacrifice the heroes at the same time, but in the end the heroes save the day) BUT I don't think movies like this ever go old. I am a 32 years old woman and felt like making a cape out of my sheets and go play superheroes after I saw this movie. It was really funny at parts (the whole theatre was laughing) and the action bits weren't overly long which usually make me go ""yawn""!. All in all, this movie is the best one I have seen in a long time, and I am usually very critical about movies.

","To start with I cannot understand how anyone can give this under 5 out of 10 stars let alone the ridiculous 1 star ratings. We watched this movie knowing it was going to be a superhero flick so was basically going to have a lot of action scenes and naturally it's going to be full of CGI. Also I expected some one liners that would be witty and corny. If you expected anything different then your previous superhero movie experiences may of been categorized a little wrong. All up it was a great movie and lived up to my expectations which is usually not the case. It was a longer than expected movie and probably could of been shortened a little in the first half but all was forgiven once the heroes started showing off their skills. Some great witty humor, some lines a little corny. The storyline was not too predictable either. Unless of coarse you feel the superheroes saving the day is too predictable.

It is packed with action, costumed superheroes, villains, gadgets, plot-twists, witty dialogue - much like a well written comic strip. However, for those not entirely familiar with the heroes, as well as those who are looking for a more serious plot, they won't find anything deep in this flick. It is, as Roger Ebert put it, ""The Westminster Dogshow of superheroes.""

I made a decision, and walked out of the film half way through. Unsure as to whether the huge hype had just made the film a complete let-down, I decided to give it another chance when it was released on DVD. I realised where the film had gone wrong. As a Marvel fan, I knew the back story, the characters and previous movie plots. However the Avengers failed to explain any of this. No character development what so ever, and although I was aware of the story, I found myself having to wrack my brain to remember things from the comics. The film is just another generic superhero movie. Nothing new, nothing special.

For those of u who have had a previous knowledge about the avengers plot, would know that CAPTAIN America was their all-in-all leader.

","Walking into The Avengers I was expecting a total ""popcorn"" film with great visuals, explosions, and awesome fighting. I got that, but I also got a pretty good story, great comical dialogue, and a great mix of badass-ery and fun. I think their aim with this film was to have the awesome explosions, as well as the funny script make this movie enjoyable for the whole family. With this aim, I think they pulled it off flawlessly, the fighting sequences had you ready to stand up and applaud, and the lines were legitimately funny, and there wasn't a corny superhero line throughout the whole thing! Thank the lord. Now, to answer my question above, could it have been better? My answer is yes. I think the movie was a bit too predictable in ways, like how in every moment of trouble somebody comes out of nowhere and saves the day. I mean of course they can't have anything too extreme, but it was a bit campy in the sense of how Iron Man would fly out of nowhere and swoop somebody up seconds before the get destroyed. Also, the biggest problem I had was with Loki. Loki was a decent choice for the villain, but The Avengers had absolutely no trouble with him. Not at all. I mean, he is a GOD and they beat the crap out of him each moment before he got done talking.

I disliked the Iron Man movies for the same reason and would prefer a more serious tone. The choice was however financially smart. Contrary to popular opinion, I also prefer the old Nick Fury from the original Marvel continuity. The action becomes a little repetitive towards the end since suspending disbelief that any of the heroes could ever seriously get hurt or die is impossible. Yes, all the characters are given time to shine and I've always trusted the director's name. He takes pains to explain everything, including why most of the heroes who are supposed to be masked are out strutting their actor's faces around the whole movie (which they wouldn't do in the comics). In spite of watching this expensive spectacle on 2D, I was surprised to notice a few background scenes that looked fake.

The special effects were not enough to justify some screaming plot holes that I was inches away from screaming out in the middle of the movie theatre, not to mention the at times stolid performances from some of the cast. Lets get something clear, just because two characters argue, does not mean an ""extra dimension"" was added to them. Robert Downey Junior does a good job but there is little else here in terms of acting. Apart from this, the movie just follows a PAINFULLY formulaic story line. Team of superheroes get together to fight a grand evil and must put their differences aside for the greater good, which they eventually do. And of course, Captain America struts onto the scene and begins shouting orders, somehow he rips this authority from thin air amongst a God, an egotistic super genius millionaire and the bloody Hulk! Overall cheesy, completely devoid of any novelties and shamelessly formulaic. the 3 stars are for the slight entertainment I got from the film at times.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

Also, where is the real suspense in a fight when nobody can be killed? All the Avengers and even Loki were either immortal or at least seemingly invincible, so after a while it felt like watching an endless fight that no one could win.

","To describe this in one word it would be incredibly difficult, but if I had to I would choose superb. The acting in this movie is phenomenal, the characters are amazing and full of depth, and this is absolutely stunning. In addition to that the story progression is amazing, from seeing all of the heroes in disagreement in the beginning to bringing them all together in an epic conclusion to save the world from Loki, I just am without words. It is everything you could ever want from a super hero movie. From the perfect blend of screen time for every character to so many great on liners and humorous moments, I left the theater jumping with joy. And the puny god moment had everyone in the theaters rolling; along with just about every time Robert Downey Jr. opened his mouth. This is just gold. Oh, and back to the alien fight at the end. Joss Whedon's choice of slowly panning around the battlefield showing every single hero fighting through the seemingly unbeatable threat, made me feel like I was truly watching a comic book. From the interactions to the CGI love I give this a 10 out o 10. ""There is no throne, there is no version of this where you come out on top!

","If you haven't seen any of the other movies such as, Thor, Iron Man, The Hulk, or Captain America, then this movie will have you lost. It does not give you enough background information to understand some of the film. For instance, when Natasha Romanoff says to Agent Phil Coulson that she didn't want to bring Tony Stark better known as Iron Man into Headquarters because Tony didn't, ""trust her as far as he could throw her"" I wonder to myself, ""why doesn't he trust her?"" and the question is never answered throughout the film. Along with the scene when Agent Phil Coulson and Thor are standing in front of a computer with a young blonde women's profile opened and the Agent tells Thor that he got her out of the country to keep her out of danger during the battle to come. The movie does not explain why she is important to Thor and it doesn't explain who she is. The characters do not mesh together and the acting his horrible. The scene that Captain America is in a plane with Agent Coulson, the acting is horrible and the dialogue with the intended humor is bland. My first time watching the film, I paid more attention to the special effects and I do give credit that producer Joss Whedon and his crew did a decent job with that. But the second time watching the film, I focused on the characters and plot and I was not impressed. The movie has no surprises in it, the fighting scene in the end is dull and drags on and the ending result of the fight is not only predictable, but clichéd. I do not believe this movie deserved an 8.7 rating because for a two and a half hour movie, it does more dull action scenes then character explanation and background that it needs to make the viewer fully understand what is even going on between all the characters. The most confusing relationship between two characters is between Natasha Romanoff and Agent Barton. When Natasha is speaking with Loki, they discuss Agent Barton a little bit but the conversation bounces from Agent Barton to Bruce Banner so much that I got completely lost. If you are all caught up on your Marvel movies, then I'm sure the film would be much more enjoyable for you, but as for me, I was not impressed in the least.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","The only reason I walked into the screening because of its ridiculous hype even by the most trusted critics beyond that even the featurette or trailers did not interest me at all. I felt like I watched something out of a kids happy meal and if we are going to expect movies like these in future receiving undeserving acclaim and astounding attention, then I guess it is indeed an offense of naming and giving out Razzberry awards. As I would believe that there are movies with poor reception to be actually highly underrated. The movie starts off with a lousy science experiment at one of the S.H.I.E.L.Ds lab where a portal opens up allowing Loki from an alternate universe to pop in and to begin with his agenda of destruction and dominance. In response to the threat the director of S.H.I.E.L.D Nick fury opens up the Avenger's initiative which has all the super humans or superheroes to team up for you know what. The movie is a cocktail of a lousy plot, poor acting( except for Robert Downey Jr whose presence in the film made it tolerable to some extent). Worst of all it was Samuel l Jackson in his role as the director of S.H.I.E.L.D, Nick fury. I seriously had a problem of tolerating his presence on screen with his unethical portrayal of his character. He only wouldn't be the sole perpetrator, as everyone else(except for Robert again) also portrayed their respective roles like they were starring in some sort of parody of the original. Praise would go to the visual effects and the action sequences which I don't think it is much of a giant leap for mankind in the present date with a good budget of 250 million!, well of course hats off to the animators and sfx designers who did an excellent job to save the sinking boat, at least making it an visual spectacle.

","Avengers Assemble, a Marvel Studio film, directed by Joss Whedon. Comic fans most anticipated film of the year. The film slowly began gathering momentum since, The Incredible Hulk staring Edward Norton was released, back in 2008. Slowly over the course of years the other films followed, given the none comic book fan a look into some of the characters in the Avenger Team, before they became part of the Avengers. (In order of release date) Hulk, Iron Man, Capitan America; these films were a pre sequel to Avengers Assemble. The character development in this films comes from their interaction together and them becoming a team. The film follows the 6 superhuman characters known as Iron Man (Tony Stark), Captain America (Steve Rogers, The Hulk (Bruce Banner), Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff ), Thor and Hawkeye (Clint Barton );lead by the master of deception and secrets Nick Fury. On a journey of self discovery, and finding out what part or purpose they really have in been an Avenger. These hero's are tasked with the burden of saving the world from alien annihilation and from the wicked grasp Loki, Thor half brother. The film seemed to stick to the original Avengers comics faithfully drawing the necessary and integral parts from the comic and inserting them on the big screen, for example the Helicarrier (floating S.H.I.EL.D aircraft) . Like many action films of today CGI and special effects have become a household commodity It would have been easier to leave this comic book nugget out, but through the use of realistic CGI and special effects, Whedon was able to incorporate this in a none shoddy way. Although the film heavily relied on special effects and green screen, everything was appropriately placed. The all star cast, which had many in a pessimistic mood, pulled through, the actors gelled well which made their on screen chemistry believable, as a result they were able to bring to life and capture the mind-set of the character they were playing. All the characters were given their chance to shine with such precision, lost in many films of these calibre and actors. Yes the film had many clichéd lines, but the actors pulled them off without subjecting the audience through painful cheese moments. Does the film give you your money's worth, narrative, action, good special effects, and yet stays faithful to the comic? To answer that question you need to watch it yourself. But as far as superhero films go, this is one of the better ones in terms of entertainment, and realism many people expect to see in an action/ fantasy film.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

The effects weren't anything to complain about and the storyline definitely kept me interested.

","The Avengers is the most fun, crowd-pleasing movie I've seen in years. Its no wonder Marvel's The Avengers shattered the box office record with over 200,000,000 dollars domestic this weekend. It's barely been out and its made half a billion dollars. The Avengers has been around for about 50 years and after 5 movies leading up to this, the Avengers delivers. The theater was a mad house when I saw it Saturday. There were little kids and old people as well. This movie is great for all ages. The older people finally get to see the super heroes they grew up with finally on the big screen and the little kids will get great role models to look up to. The movie puts great emphasis on how teamwork results in victory. The character development is great. Each superhero gets enough screen time, but the Hulk steels the show and is sure to be everyone's favorite. The best moments in the movie are when the Hulk is on screen. They did a good job on showing how Captain America assumed the leader position on the team. Iron Man/ Tony Stark is witty as always and Thor is also cool. The team is balanced and everyone, even puny Hawk Eye and Black Widow, contributes. This movie has it all. Great action, character development, comedy, and story. It can be a little cheesy but in a good way. There are moments when the whole theater will laugh, clap and cheer. Its a fun way to start off summer. I know I'm picking this up as soon as it hits the shelves. Along with Spiderman 2 and Dark Knight, the Avengers is one of the best superhero movies to date.

","I had expected more from Joss Whedan, but The Avengers (a.k.a Marvel's Avengers, a.k.a Marvel Avengers Assemble and various other permutations of this terrible title) is just another superhero movie: dull and hackneyed plot, poor characterisation, lots of fighting. It provides plenty for its pre-teen/early-teenage male target audience - great special effects, no romance and a very lengthy battle sequence at the end - but doesn't offer enough to adults to sustain interest for its 140-minute length. It is only saved from mediocrity by two factors: the humour in the script and Robert Downey's performance. I also credit Tom Hiddleston's performance as Loki, but the of the cast generally fail to shine. Even Samuel L.

I was a little uncertain of how all these mega movie stars were all going to fit into 1 movie, well a massive well done to Joss Whedon, if you don't get goosebumps every time one superhero meets another then you clearly have something wrong with you. Like I'm not even joking, go to the doctors or something. The effort that was put into that to make sure it was pulled off was, well, phenomenal. This was my biggest concern about the movie and I for one was not left disappointed. The back story of all the characters were impeccably placed, Whedon took the time needed to re-introduce you to each character which I guess for people who live under rocks it's perfect for, however I wasn't bored watching this, it needed to be in the movie to remind you of each hero's struggle and why they are the way they are.

","Since the dawn of men, we aspired to be heroes. We told each other stories of strong and smart men who fought in legendary battles, stood against fearsome beasts and saved beautiful damsels in distress. Since the 20s of the last century, some people have been writing such stories down in the form of comic books and graphic novels. Two of the people who did this were Stan Lee and Jack Kirby at Marvel Comics. The created among others the rich genius in a flying suit called Iron Man, the super soldier called Captain America, a new version of thunder god Thor, two spies under the names Black Widow and Hawkeye and of course the man that turns into a big, green, angry monster which calls itself Hulk. Comics like this were made into movies, but nearly all of them had some flaws. They weren't like the comics, took themselves to serious, made to much jokes or had some other flaws. Now a pretty unknown director takes a few famous heroes of Marvel (see above) and makes a movie with them with does no mistakes the other movies made.

Well then why did I sit back with a big ""meh"" ? Every aspect of this film was perfectly executed yet for some reason it lacked that absolute WOW factor for me. That final touch that makes a good movie into a great movie. Perhaps it was the constant humour instigated into the story which by the way were hilarious, that possibly was overdone and seemed to ruin the movie a bit for me. At times it felt like a bit of a joke to me, which left me cackling endlessly but evidently shaking my head at how they could do this. I just lacked the ability to take this film seriously at times. However immediately giving 'The Avengers' a 6 or even 5/10 I realised that it did what it did perfectly, and although I didn't get what I wanted out of it, and the fact that it didn't live up to my expectations, doesn't make it a bad film. In fact looking back it was quite the contrary. I enjoyed it, and it is most likely that you will too. If I had of gone into it with an open mind I would of loved it, and I intend to do that on my second viewing. However I recommend that you definitely see 'The Avengers' as it certainly is a good and entertaining film, definitely Marvels Best! Just enjoy the film and you will laugh and gasp at its perfect execution of action that at times puts CGI to its test. I look forward to a sequel and a second viewing of this.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

I had really enjoyed Iron Man (2008) and Captain America (2011), but I hadn't enjoyed Thor (2011), I hadn't even seen Incredible Hulk (2008) because of how bad I heard it was, and I didn't really like Iron Man 2 (2010).

The lines are unforgettable (especially by Nick Fury/Samuel L. Jackson), and the two distinct climactic battles are both completely satisfying. I now want movies to make me feel the way this movie made me feel. It is (largely) for my entire generation the definitive cinematic experience. The other thing that stands is my college professors complaining---in the most cliche way possible---that it ""didn't say anything about the human experience."" Man, those guys were overpaid.

","Avengers movie review Oh my god I love this movie. I went with a friend who prefers to be not named. We both loved it. It was incredible, amazing, and awesome movie. This time I will say the plot first. Col. Nick Fury brings together Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye together to become the Avengers and fight Loki and his army of Chiturai. Robert Downey JR is Tony Stark. There is no one else that can play this role and if they get someone else he will pale in comparison. Chris Evans is so awesome as Captain America. Chris Hemsworth really nails the role as Thor. If anyone is worried about Mark Ruffalo not doing a good job as Banner. I almost feel he was better than Ed Norton. I like the Norton as Bruce too but Ruffalo really feels like Banner. He is incredible as Banner. The Hulk looks Incredible. He looks like Mark Ruffalo. You feel it. Scarlett Johansson does a great job as Black Widow. There is a scene where she speaks in a foreign language she does such a good job. She is not a perfect Black Widow but she does a good job of bringing her own take to the role. Jeremy Renner is Hawkeye. He was my fan pick. I feel like they listened to the fans when they casted him for the role. Tom Hiddleston is so sinister as Loki. He was great in the Thor movie but he is even better in this movie. Samuel L Jackson really nails the role as Nick Fury. He does such a commanding role. He knows how to take charge. Clark Greg as Agent Phil Coulson does a great job too. He knows how to take charge and he was such a fan boy around Captain America. Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill is so good. She is a great SHIELD agent. The Shield Hellcarrier is like right out of the comic book. WOW! The Quinn Jet is great too. Loki's Army is so amazing looking. Then you have the Levathion. It is not Fing Fang Foo the Dragon from the Iron Man comics. But it looks so incredible anyway. They call the cosmic cube a Tesseract. If you don't know what that means basically it can open up wormholes. The first time I heard that word is when I read the book Wrinkle in Time when I was a child so that is how I understand what it is. Everything you wanted is in this film and more. When I saw the Artist I thought no movie would beat it until now. I feel this movie has smashed my scale. I friend gave it 11/10 and so am I. So to quote Spinal tap. This dial goes to 11.

","Initiating the first crossover of Marvel's cinematic universe, as well as for The Avengers, the first installment brings us more than action and a whole solid story like Iron Man could be.
The film tells us an alliance of Supehéroess that unite to defeat Loki, Thor's evil brother, which the latter had to defeat in his solo film.
The film has a well-carried narrative, the CGI does not feel that it clashes during the film, it is intelligent to bring us an antagonist rather than entertaining as others of other films, and has a coherent reason why it does evil, while the performances They are still cool as in their films, the characters have these characteristics which make it more realistic and nothing flat, which is half questionable is the soundtrack, I mean, this is NOT very important in this genre, but placarñas, it was necessary to repeat the same Music sequence like 12 times??? ...
Although out of it, it remains in Baundcrrack and is not distracting or annoying, but prestandole attention, questionable.
While in other sections, it feels pleasant and serves, Tony is still arrogant but aware of everything that is happening, and saves the world carrying the missile that was going to destroy NY sending it to a kind of portal where the ¨ ¨ henchmen ¨ of Loki.
Thor is still arrogant as in his film, but this one concentrates on the same Loki and what he can cause.
While the Hulk has a bigger role than normal, now does not destroy things because if or destructive things, now is right and does well without feeling generic.
Much of this battle takes place in Midtown Manhattan, where the sharpest sequences involve the huge snake-lizard-wavy snake dragon Machine from Loki, which seems to have a mind of its own and is backed by countless coils. At Any given moment, a Avenger flies into the mouth of this leviathan and penetrates its full length, emerging at the end of the business.

",I went today to the 3d version of the movie in Antwerpen Belgium. Let me start to say it is very entertaining and its almost more a comedy than a Marvel Movie. Why i not rate this movie higher is because there a lot of flaws in the storyline and they step over a lot of issues to easy. Iff you compare that for example with X-Men First class or Ironman the story lines are much better so i don't really understand why the reviewers before me don't talk about that enough. The enemy is very weak(almost a single shot would kill them) and i still don't understand why Loki was doing in the plane and why he would let them catch him... And the attackers were saying that there boss would come what happened with him ? Also no variation in the enemy and what about the hoovering cockroaches who only flew against buildings did nothing. From characters the black-widow was pointless she is just shooting with a gun and Hawkeye is shooting with a bow how is that faster than a gun. This movie was saved in the first part by Tony Stark character extremely funny and the Hulk character in the second part of the movie. But how Hulk came a very smart monster who knows what he's doing i still don't know. But still its a movie worth going to the cinema but its def. not a movie which is worth a 8.4,/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

1778,9 May 2012,JdotCo,10," 'The Avengers' fulfills all expectations
","Minor spoilers ahead. If ever there's a movie for shedding tears of joy, this would be it. The beauty of seeing a long-term plan come to fruition has a satisfaction hard to replicate in any other fashion. That's the feeling you'll get after watching ""The Avengers"". Marvel's ambitious venture of building up a five-movie saga in anticipation of one grand epic, which ties a ribbon on those movies while simultaneously paving the way for future endeavors, not only pays huge dividends, but blows up the screen with pure amazement during the process. There's a certain awe to behold when watching montage fight scenes seamlessly transition from Captain America's ground-level assault to Iron Man's fly-by attacks to Hulk's crushing of gigantic enemies. There's a sense that they've got each other's back, that they're truly fighting as one team. That's the magic that drives ""The Avengers"" to heightened plateaus of superhero storytelling. These Avengers have been assembled for this purpose and show that nothing can stop them if they work together. It's during those scenes that make you think ""This is what I've been waiting for."" Makes you feel like the kid who fell in love with these stories when first reading the comics. It's a good thing the superheroes finally start working from the same playbook, because the weight of imminent failure is lurking. Loki returns as the evil leader, and he's more power hungry and bent on world control than ever. Like any superhero movie, the bad guy's quest to control the world is at the forefront. But there's realism and a dark nature to Loki that creates a sense of peril and pressure to the task of stopping him. It requires sacrifice, something some of the Avengers need to learn. Loki is truly twisted, believing that mankind needs a ruler so it can be ""free of freedom"" (it actually gets a little thought provoking). Throughout the movie, there's an unsettling feeling of the grand sinister plot, not just a gimmick that most shallow bad guys cling to. ""The Avengers"" is a little darker than the other movies. Tons of destruction ensues as the scope of the grand battle covers all of Manhattan and takes casualties along the way. Even the backup plan of a nuclear missile wiping out everything comes into play. The humor that has made the characters lovable and entertaining is present and accounted for. It was a tough balancing act to get the interactions between all the superheroes to seem fitting, but director Joss Whedon concocts the perfect mixture of screen time and blends all the superheroes together brilliantly. Yes, tensions even arise as Iron Man and Thor duke it out. From Nick Fury giving Hulk the order to smash to Tony Stark calling Coulson by his first name, ""Agent"", there's plenty of laughs from everyone, none of which are contrived (okay, some are, but not any more than any of the other Marvel films, which is a good thing). During some of those interactions, a lot is learned about the superheroes. There's some back story for Black Widow and Hawkeye that was sorely needed. Bruce Banner has some moments in the sun (side note: Edward Norton was a better Banner, but Mark Ruffalo did a good job). Captain America steps up to be the leader he was meant to be. At times, it seemed like the movie could (and maybe even should've) piggy back on anyone of these stories and flesh it out a little more, but Whedon did a good job of keeping the movie's somewhat broad focus on target. Special effects were top-notch. The art design of enemies for the final battle was creative and organic. Music was stellar. Actually, it was cool when the musical theme would get switched up a little depending on which superhero was fighting at that particular moment. Indeed, the long wait was worth it. ""The Avengers"" reaches its potential and brings out the giddiness and excitement we've all had for these superhero movies. One last note: There are two end-of-credit scenes, so stay all the way through. One gives a glimpse of what is to come in future movies (there'd better be more of them) and the other is simply a perfect capper.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

That person we believed was our hero, the one person who would always run to our rescue, whenever we called upon them. It wouldn't matter what the situation was; unfortunately as the years pass our hero's change. We become to know the real definition of a hero and our deception of them changes, a hero, which is a person, typically a man, who is admired for courage or noble qualities. Such as the character or characters in a book, play, or movie who have these noble qualities. Throughout the movie the Avengers, we learn that being a hero is not the easiest thing, it takes a lot of courage, time, hard ships and team work to accomplish the most impossible. As we see, when the heroic team, Iron Man, Hulk, Captain America, and Thor is reunited on the ship for the first time; tensions were high as we expected. They all had a different plan and understanding on how to defend their world and to take down Loki. Their inability to come together and be a team at first is a major factor is their main source of vulnerability and the outcome of Loki being five steps ahead of them. It isn't until one of their own is killed by Loki; that they actually become the Avengers. They put all their differences behind them and finally suit up to stop Loki from taking over their world. The courage each of them has to sacrifice themselves in order to make sure our world is safe is indescribable. The unstoppable force that forms when they all put their special talents and gifts together are unbreakable, their allegiance to one another is their upper hand to taking down Loki. In their finale desperation is stopping Loki and closing the portal, the viewer's get a glance at what a little bit of team work and courage and a passion for something can get you. Their team work got them to close the portal, each Avenger's courage is the reason they saved the world. And finally, their passion and pursuit to stop Loki was their unbreakable bond formed throughout the movie. Overall, the movie The Avengers, was not only made to show the comic story of the heroic team stopping Loki from taking over our world but also to show everyone what team work and courage can get you in life.

","If you're a fan of comic books or superhero movies, then The Avengers by Marvel will surely not disappoint. Watching the movie three times myself, I each time have liked the movie more and more. Compared to the blockbuster superhero movies that have come out in theaters in the summer of 2012, this movie seems to top Spider-Man and Batman simply because of the cast of superheroes that are present in this movie. This movie seems to put together the best of the best superheroes for a one big hit movie. With the names of The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, Hawkeye, and Black Widow, this movie compares to an all-star game of athletes in any given sport. In comparing the movie to other movies by Marvel, this movie stands out in a good way. This movie adds more action and more punch lines than a comic book nerd could ever dream of. In terms of putting the superheroes together, The Avengers does a marvelous job. The Avengers is essentially a sequel to Thor and Captain America, taking elements from each movie. After Loki gets exiled from his home planet of Asgard as seen in Thor after attempting to rule Asgard, he seeks out to rule again. After Captain America gets unfrozen, he is seen working out when Nick Fury stops by. Nick Fury is the man responsible for recruiting and putting together the Avengers. At first, things are shaky as the superheroes' egos clash rather than mesh together. This is easily done by Loki, shifting the attention away from him and onto personal attacks against one another by the Avengers. The constant bickering between the superheroes could have a negative impact on the audience , but it doesn't diminish the movie as a whole. In the movie, the characters don't seem to have changed from their own movies, although Iron Man learns the value of working with others. Joss Whedon is one of the best directors in the film industry and this movie proves to be one of his best big screen productions. This movie sets the bar for superhero movies as none in my experience of watching superhero movies has come close to matching it. Marvel and DC Comics will have a big challenge ahead of them when they come out with new movies because any that doesn't match The Avengers would be a disappointment.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

That's what I want to see, a movie where I can't see exactly what is real and what's fake. The Avengers lived up to it's hype.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

This movie had a unique way to tell the back stories of the heroes, instead of just cramming all that information into a small part of the movie and making so you only got part of the story instead, they made prequel movies for each of the heroes expect for Hawkeyes which his back story was in Thor, Nick Fury which back story was in both Thor and Iron Man and Black Window which her back story was in the Iron man movies.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

Hey, you might even give yourself a super hero name to make you feel like one of the crew. Avenger's style is much different than many other super hero movies that there has been in the past. Marvel has struck gold with the concept that they have brought forth to the millions of fans of their superhero army. Every child had that one super hero that they wanted to be as a kid while they were growing up. Yeah Marvel has given each one of these heroes their fame separately, but that way is a thing of the past. What's better to hit two birds with one stone you might ask? How about ten birds with one stone? That's what The Avengers creators did when they brought together all of your child hood heroes into one movie. Just the idea is pure genius. Yeah a single character may appeal to wide audience but having multiple characters with millions of followers that would want to see their movie all together equals big money. So that's why the concept of this movie as a whole is a win for the Marvel Company. The way that all of the characters in this film were brought together was a great way to bring the viewer up to date. Even if the viewer didn't watch one Marvel movie or pick up a comic book before this could comprehend what was going on. Marvel introduced one character at a time so that the viewer would not get all jumbled up and they would also show where the character has been of that time, not just by plucking them from thin air.

Although the plot was a downfall, the action and the perfect screen-time for each of the heroes redeemed it. Also, the camera angles are so unique that you just have to appreciate the movie more. If you liked Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, or The Incredible Hulk, you will LOVE this movie. Also, they change Hulk for the better, so now he becomes the Hulk when he gets mad (not when his heart rate goes up) and he was more there for comedy. However, the climax and the way they solved the problem was bad, just having Iron Man fly up into the oblivion of space. Well, actually, that part was okay, but when he came back down to Earth he was unconscious, so Hulk stomped and roared to wake him up.

Striking the perfect balance between dark and light (in the pain vs fun sense) no time is wasted on introducing the heroes or the villains (it is assumed you know them already and of course you do)and the pacing is perfect. The action sequences are well done and pure comic book, there is no slacking in the pacing but you do not get a lot of the ""what-the-hell-jst-happened"" too fast to follow action . That is the essence of it, a comic brought to life in a way that you don't question. The balance of the characters is right too. Stark's smartass humour counterpoints Captain America's straight guy perfectly and the swaggering Thor goes well sided with the mild Banner and brutal Hulk. Hulk especially is someone who worries everyone in this, unpredictable yet necessary, he is a presence even when he isn't big and green. Sure there are some unbelievable bits, if I had taken even a fraction of the punishment Black Widow does whilst fighting the bad guys I would wind up dead or very injured at best and the consequence of actions taken is not always carried through but Hey!

","I shall start this review by mentioning the fact that The Avengers is one of the most overrated movies of all time. It's simply awful. If you agree with the large fanbase of idiots who enjoyed this film listen carefully. Joss Wheadon is an autistic oversized 5 year old who crammed his dreams and aspirations of being a superhero into a big budget, eye pleasing blockbuster with less than mediocre acting and terrible green screen. The storyline is so tedious (I don't even care if it's based on a popular comic series) that i wouldn't be surprised if a 5 year old wrote this movie. There is an incredible amount of bad acting (which deserves to be in a junior school play) displayed by Chris Hemsworth and Tom Huddlestone (despite being the only credited actor I respect on this film. Now you may argue that Robert-Downey Jr. is an amazing actor, but I disagree. His ego flourishes as Tony Stark which displays his incapicity to act in various roles. SUMMARY: The Avengers is an extremely overrated film which is no where near on the level as Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"". It contains poor script writing, cheesy effects, acting and directing.

","This movie just did not do it for me. The movie was a box office hit: it made $623,279,547 in the United States alone, and is third on the list of top grossing films of all time. However, a movie's earnings do not suggest it was a great film. Obviously the concept was a hit: comic book superheroes converging to save earth and fight interstellar enemies. I just think the movie was flat, though. I myself am not a comic book enthusiast, so I do not personally care for superheroes and the sort, but the movie itself just seemed so bland. The characters actions seemed forced and there was just too much action for the movie to have any sort of depth. Of course, there had to be action, since they are superheroes, but I just felt like so much more could have been done with the film. I did not think the actors did very well, either. I think it was just the film, though: most of them are great actors. Crossovers and ensemble character films usually do not do well, and this film is a prime example. It was bland, predictable, and lacking in many fields, such as character depth and plot. Maybe it is just my own aversion to comic book films, specifically Marvel ones (I did not even like Guardians... shoot me now!), but I think many would agree with me in saying this summer blockbuster was severely underwhelming.

When I woke up, it was the last fighting scene. The same thing seemed to keep happening over and over again, so it wasn't really that exciting. The only thing I got out of that movie was some of Hulk's jokes, which were pretty funny, and Iron Man makes you laugh too sometimes. Other than that, it was only OK.

1845,15 June 2019,ericlassiterthesecond,8," Epic, Exciting and Well Made.
","This movie started off the big budget franchise we loved for 7 years by now. Ok, let me get into why I liked this film. Starting with Story,
The story is interesting as it kept my attention from beginning to end and it was so exciting for us to have our heroes come together to fight against Loki but The Avengers doesn't have much of a story as it doesn't have layers to its story and its very simplistic compared to the complexity of the other Avengers films. They told a cohesive and understandable storyline in this first Avengers film.
Second, let's get into the characters of this film.
The characters have really great banter between them as you have really good chemistry between each member of the Avengers. The main characters have backstory established in the previous MCU Solo Films that built up to the Avengers and the characters are elaborately written. Cap as an example is a brave Soldier as established in the First Avenger and his character see's in Tony a man who wouldn't sacrifice himself or any kind of character inside the suit. Tony see's a man who got all his powers from a bottle who isn't worthy but they both prove each other wrong in specific MCU films such as Tony who almost killed himself to stop the Chitauri Invasion on Earth. Tony is a great character who's trying to do good and has guilt over his mistakes that he's done but I wish they had gone more into this backstory. The only character I didn't like was Loki, the villain who you couldn't understand and you didn't know why he was invading Earth. He's just a big threat who wants to Invade Earth because he just wants to but all the heroes have arcs until they cooperate with each other.
Third, let's explore the themes of this movie. There's deep themes of Sacrifice, Teamwork and Heroism. The Avengers mostly are working as a team and from beginning to end, they learn to cooperate with each other so they can defeat Loki. All the heroes are saving the world from Loki. An example of Sacrifice is Tony who almost sacrifices himself to save Earth from the Chitauri invasion.
Fourth, let's explore the acting. The cast is amazing. Robert Downey Jr is the best actor here as you cannot imagine anyone else in this role and Chris Evans shows the bravery of his character here. Scarlet Johansson is attractive and she's a fun female character who's a interesting spy. Mark Ruffalo has more charming humor than the other Hulk Actors and he's always having fun in this role. For me, the cast was great as everyone did a good job on their performances and roles.
Next, let me analyze the visuals. The special effects here are stunning as they all look realistic and the visuals are overly authentic as there's never a look at really fake looking CGI or special effects. The movie did well in this category. Therefore i like the movie and rate it 8/10.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

Loki taking over the earth, Shield corporations, super heroes on pms emotions and obscure aliens. Even worse were superfluous characters like the black widow. It was just a huge mess of sci fi and super hero clichés. So why do I give it a 5? A mediochre rating? Because it had good acting, some funny scenes and when watched on a huge screen is pretty.

1853,30 June 2012,rehan-prins,4," Good if you don't mind a bad story/plot
","I saw the Avengers with no real knowledge of the comic book series or any of the characters beforehand. However it took me only 10 minutes of reading IMDb reviews to realise that the waters are clearly divided between Avengers fans and Dark Knight fans. For me I was disappointed after seeing The Avengers however I can largely attribute that to my backgrounds in reading, understanding and writing about complex ideas, something Christopher Nolan's films have drawn out of me. With that said though, the Avengers is a different kind of comic book film. If you're looking for a fun, action based movie for kids then the Avengers is for you. However if you have desires for films with grand ideas, deep characters and complex plots as well as the Batman factor, then the Dark Knight Rises is definitely for you. One thing is certain though, you cannot compare both films against each other. Joss Whedon uses the core elements of the comic series that brought out a very Michael Bay representation while Chrisopher Nolan transforms the comic book ideas into grander social commentaries on moral and philosophical issues while still giving the Dark Knight the attention it deserves. I found the Avengers to be a typical clichè heroes win, predictable, static film something which really takes the sting out of a film for me. I sat through the film realising that the Avengers would come through and win by the way the film was constructed. With the Dark Knight, no one could have predicted the Jokers complex schemes involving Harvey Dent and the way that Batman still beat the joker yet lost the most in the end. That is in my opinion where the Avengers falls short. It's use of poorly developed characters such as Loki, predictable story line and plot, overuse of CG and cliché's give it his rating. Sorry Avengers fans it might be hard to understand but trust me, people who write bad reviews for the Avengers criticizing plot and story are well read and any movie needs a good and dynamic plot regardless of the genre.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","I just watched Avengers, 2 hours ago, and I personally don't think Avengers lives up to the hype it has got. Is it a good movie? That's a definite yes from my side, anyone who's into action movies and who knows these characters would enjoy the movie. But for people who don't really know much about these characters would get a little bored and might find it hard to follow, as it happened with my friends. 10 of us went for the movie, 3 people though it was hard to follow. Also one should know they are going for an action movie, action sequences are awesome, dialogues are OK not exceptional but OK. They have tried to make the movie funny, but there are only like 3 laughs out loud moments, with 2 other that makes you smile. Interestingly enough Hulk was in 3 out of 5 of those moments. Iron Man is funny, but now wow funny. Thor looked very ordinary in the movie, his acting was OK not wow. Captain America looks a little misplaced among the super powered people, and sadly Black Widow has a lot more say in the movie than does Captain America. Hawkeye got his moment to shine but isn't as focused as one who expect. Hulk and Loki, their acting stood out. Of course, Loki being the main villain gets the most to do and Hulk was the funniest among them all, after he transforms. MINOR SPOILERS, it's nice to see hulk finally learn how to control his transformation although how he learns it is never shown. There are few plot holes in the movie, we don't really understand how Hulk from being a raging uncontrollable monster because a hero all of a sudden and decides to fight for the avengers. Nick Fury doesn't get to do much apart from blow up a helicopter, Captain America has some fights scenes before Loki brings his army but later Captain America didn't really play a big part in the movie at all. Aliens were below par, they didn't even spend time with the aliens, and they looked more like mindless beasts following command from their master, who is shown post credit and will not be named for the purpose of this review. There are no twists and turns in the movie, the story could easily have been summarized in few lines as Loki - World Domination - Army - Avengers Assembles - gets his arse handed to him. Action scenes were AWESOME and it's a very action heavy movie. I hope I have not spoiled anything for you because I don't really wanna get into details of how the movie actually plays.

Interspersing flip one-liners with a host of larger-than-life characters and the usual flurry of fight-and-flight scenes, the film is never less than amusing. Still, it's never more than amusing either. Marvel Studios has made it a point of pride to diverge from the grim severity popularized in the DC / Warner Bros Batman films. The lightness is fun but it doesn't offer much of a foundation on which to build an epic. And let's face it, there's more than a whiff of opportunism about a project that pits a defrosted World War II hero, Captain America (Chris Evans), an inventor-industrialist, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), the pagan lightning god, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), a scientist with anger- management issues, Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and SHIELD agents Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) against the Norse god of mischief, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and a legion of marauding aliens.

The movie frankly did have a slow start but from the point where we see Tony Stark and Thor in ""Shakespeare in the park"" scene the movie hits of with a non stop action mixed with a very above average hilariousness.

By the way should mention the Hulk of this movie separately, even though this was his first notable appearance as a super hero or in an action role and that too with other guys who are extremely or slightly experienced in action movies , Mark Ruffalo did stand out from most of the them. Scarlett Johansson and Robert Downey Jr. were fabulous and incredibly entertaining as usual .Chris Hemsworth proves he is better along with his buddies than alone like in his own Thor movie.

","I'm very satisfied with the outcome of this theatrical event. The movie has actually succeeded my expectations. Okay, maybe not succeeded, but it definitely fulfilled them. I'm sure anyone would agree that this was, by far the best of the Marvel series. There were many laughs which is one of the fine parts of the movie. Tony Stark played by returning Robert Downey Jr. had most of the witty lines, but he wasn't the only one to bring laughs. Another fine point of the movie was the action. This movie had non stop action. Don't get me wrong, this wasn't just a blow up everything movie, it all had reason. It had well choreographed fight scenes like the one involving Black Widow playing by the lovely Scarlett Johansson and many others involving the Avengers. Loki, Tom Hiddleston, was the best villain one could ask for. He was menacing enough to take seriously, but yet he still managed to be likable. The first scene when he comes in is just amazing. Tom Hiddleston obviously just loves show stealing because he's do it again. And HULK, let's talk about him. If there's someone who stood out in this movie, its definitely Bruce Banner, played by the first time hulk, Mark Ruffalo. He was, I'm sorry but, INCREDIBLE. There are some scenes where you just can't help but to cheer for him. He is the best Hulk ever. Come on Marvel, before you give Cap and Thor another movie, why not give him one? He had the best scenes in the movie. Mark's acting as Bruce was just as good as Hulk's CGI. I could talk about Hulk forever, but moving on, I like the character development.

The chemistry between all the characters was great although I would say they got a bit cheesy sometimes. I would also have liked to see more back story regarding Hawkeye and the Black Widow. Most of the movie is shot on the aircraft carrier and in my opinion it did not really pick up until the final scenes. The turning point of the film seemed a bit exaggerated to me as well.

1876,18 November 2012,Brittany-Jurczyk,," Avengers Who?
","The Avengers was a fantastic movie bringing all the Marvel movies together seamlessly. This is what I may have said if I'd ever seen or read anything Marvel in my life. Now, I realize this isn't the movie or producers fault, I'm just speaking for myself who happens to be utterly ignorant and oblivious to the world of comics in general. To start out the movie, I was happily surprised to think I was following the movie without any background knowledge. Suddenly I came to the realization that I was mistaken, being thrown into some sort of futuristic space ship setting. I was continuously introduced to new characters that didn't have character development as I was expected to be read up on that information before hand. The importance of the characters and their role in the movie tended to be a roller coaster ride. At the beginning, Scarlett Johansson grabbed my attention and stole the movie with everything she had to offer to the action side of the movie. She even took on 3 men without a blink. Somewhere along the line she ends up standing in the shadows without much to offer until the ending scenes. Chris Hemsworth's role in the film seems lost to me as well. The back and forth between helping Loci and wanting to take him down seems almost as if he's lost on which side to take. This was distracting to me. As a whole, the characters were interesting, however didn't exactly connect the story well. By the middle of the movie it dawned on me that it was becoming more and more predictable. From what I've gathered, no super hero movie has ended in the super hero's loss. Loci shows no sign of changing his ways from ""evil"" thus, the outcome become inevitable no matter what Loci throws the Avengers way. From that point on, every conversation of confusion between the characters and talk of what the next step will be to take seems pointless. The wondering and guessing games could have been done without as far as I'm concerned. The ending of the movie seemed to be too far fetched and far too drawn out to be enjoyable. Plausibly, they all should've died before the Hulk came around. The way the creatures were destroying buildings, it was hard to accept the fact that, even with super powers, they were destroying them one by one. The setting of this battle was also a little out of reach. Showing everyone walk away unharmed and guarded by the NYPD is beyond realistic given what the other creatures were capable of. None of the pedestrians seemed to even be worried about the danger in the aftermath, only thankfulness and gratitude for those who saved them. Is that how it would really happen? I surely wouldn't think so. As for the meaning and the plot line revolving around the Tesseract, I couldn't even being to explain that to someone. The power it holds and the large question ""why"" it holds the power it holds still confuses me. The knowledge needed for this movie before going into it seems to outweigh watching the film out of pleasure. While I understood the concept of the movie and could still gather main points, I believe that it reached out to more of the large Marvel fans that have been following for years, or decades. This movie was slightly disappointing, but what do I know, I'm still asking the question, Avenger who?",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","A+ For The Avengers I must say from the film ""The Avengers"" I believe it is one of the best action hero movies ever made. I expected it to be a great movie for the simple fact that they had the Hulk , Thor , and several other big name heroes in it. But this movie really blew me away with how they constructed it. The way they brought all the characters together in the storyline , and had them all be able to connect and shows that each knew of each other already to me was amazing. The film also brought a lot of action and one on one fights. Which I believe everyone who is a fan of these films loved because the question is always asked who the best superhero is. But besides the fighting each other there were a lot of action in New York that just blows your mind, the nonstop adrenaline, anticipating what will happen next just have you on the edge of your seat, biting your finger nails. I believe the actors/actresses did an amazing job on portraying these characters. They really brought them to life and interconnect them. I personally never saw Thor the movie, but he brought it in this movie to where I didn't need to go watch that movie first. Thor and Hoki had a moment where it explains what they are and who they are. I like how they brought that out it really makes the film that much better. And also I like how when they go to recruit it shows a little about every person but not too much these characters were played at their best. Costumes and props where amazing, from iron man's new suits, to captain America actually still wearing his new suite in the current life. And Thors hammer that you believed was real from the sound effects. The Avengers brought there A game with this film. Creating a reflection, flying ship that looks invisible. The new technology they brought to this movie I would have never thought of. One last thing I liked how they showed the avengers departing and going back to their daily lives, but also leaves you to think maybe there will be another movie. Guess we will just have to wait and see for ourselves.

","I usually try not to read or hear too many reviews about a movie before I actually get to see it on screen, but I must admit that it was really hard for me not to sneak a peek in advance at a few comments, both on this website and on magazines. Most comments went from good to excellent. In my opinion, this movie IS excellent. The most commendable achievement is the fluid way the cast of superheroes were assembled:the way they were first individually introduced into the plot, and then the (funny) dynamics they were eventually thrown into. Each character kept their peculiar aspects, but at the same time none of them ended up prevailing on the others. Take Stark, witty fellow who cracks jokes every now and then; add Rogers,law- abiding soldier; Thor, the god of thunder who is thorn between his will to protect the Earth and his affection to brother Loki, who is plotting more than ever a way to enslave our planet; take also a new version of Banner/Hulk, brilliantly played by Mark Ruffalo,and two characters- Black Widow and Hawkeye-who, although only superficially introduced in the previous chapters of the franchise, manage to add freshness and continuity at the same time to the original group: the result is an absorbing and entertaining piece of work. Another aspect worth mentioning is the fact that the main focus on this movie were neither the CGI, nor the sentimental statuses of the characters, but the heroes themselves and the story involving them. Everything was clear-cut and incisive; 2 hours and a half just flew by, and in the end I felt like I could have watched even more. The acting in my opinion was great- except for mediocre Johansson, IMO. Worth mentioning are Ruffalo's and Hiddleston's performances: the first one because he managed to be a ""new"" Banner/Hulk by keeping the character's main aspects on focus; the second one because, well, Hiddleston is just a great actor!

","This right here is the true beginning of the MCU. It is a brilliant pay off to everything leading up to it, doesn't introduce anything new until the post-credits scenes, and uses its pre-existing characters brilliantly. For the past four years, people were waiting for a pay off and this did not disappoint. The only character who didn't really meet expectations would be Hawkeye, due to being mind controlled most of the movie. And on top of that, the Helicarrier battle feels like it drags on just a bit too much. Other than that, it's great. Tony is at his best yet, with a mix of comedy and intrigue that comes with his character, Steve has a few fish out of water jokes, but they mostly land, Thor is amazing, Mark Ruffalo did not disappoint as Hulk, Natasha, Fury, and Coulson are all fun, and Tom Hiddleston delivers one of the best performances as a villain in the entire superhero genre. He comes on screen, you know it's gonna be good. Coulson's death, while lessened a bit by Agents of S. H. I. E. L. D., is still the saddest seen yet and motivates the characters in the final battle. Speaking of, the fight scenes are amazing. The fight between Tony and Thor and the fight between Hulk and Thor were instantly iconic, especially the end of the Tony and Thor fight. And the Battle of New York... Wow. That shot of the characters finally together is one of the most iconic moments in modern cinema, as it should be. The scene where it pans around the battle, showing all the characters is very memorable. If the Helicarrier scene was a little shorter and Hawkeye was more developed, this could've maybe been a 9 out of 10.

","I brag about movies being good all the time, but rarely when I believe they are great. I'm a fan of all genres of movies, but lately I have felt a bond to grow with superhero movies because they keep getting better, it seems Hollywood finally listened to regular, common people that pay to watch the movies they produce. It has been a while since I walked out of a movie theater with a sense of satisfaction, and today was no exception. I live in El Paso Texas, but today I crossed the border(legally of course), to Juarez to watch the avengers movie. I know I am still a little immature at my age(35), on some things of course, but sitting at the movie theater I felt like a kid again, happy, excited, and with a smile from cheek to cheek when it was over. I am a geek regarding comic books, superhero movies and stuff, heck, my favorite toy and item of collection is my wolverine #1 in near-mint condition, lol. But seriously, this is a movie to see more than once in movie theaters, specially in 3d, then purchase it on blu-ray when it comes out, because it will be one of those movies that you can watch over and over, I am very happy this movie was made, every other superhero movie that comes out after this has to be spectacular, near- perfect, because this movie just raised the bar for the genre, good job, and thanks to everyone involved in creating this awesome production.

In The Avengers, Nick Fury, director of the peacekeeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D., recruits Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, and Thor to form a team that must stop Thor's adoptive brother Loki from overpowering Earth. Loki, with his long and flowing hair, had teamed up with the alien race. Together they tried to steal the Tesseract, which, in turn, could destroy the world. Captain America was the first to be introduced. He started in World War II and was awoken in 2011.He was the first member of the Avengers team. Each member of the team had a unique characteristic. The Hulk had enormous strength, Captain America in bravery, Iron Man's had ability to fly, Thor's unbearable hammer, Black Widow in sexiness, and Hawkeye's unbeatable arrows. The biggest challenge happened in the beginning of the movie, when the Avengers had to face each other. The argument of how to approach Loki turned the members away from each other. Whedon, the director, forced his heroes against one another to get them to bond. This movie was mainly classified as action and adventure.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

One can argue that surrealism and fantasy is at the core of the Marvel Comics experience. However, some people expect a degree of reality to mix with the fiction, which is where ""magic"" happens and classics are made. The enemies that the heroes must face look a lot like video game characters, mindlessly going about their do-harm business for no other reason other than that they are ""bad"". The tactics employed by the enemies are laughable and their strategy non existent. One would expect more of these enemies, especially considering that they are supposed to be so technologically advanced.

","I had been waiting for this movie for a long, long time. I had big expectations from this movie. And, needless to say, it completely blew me away! The movie takes off from the beginning, with high-octane but smart action, with a couple of breathers, and doesn't let go until the very, very end. I was astounded by the quality of the film itself. I knew that I couldn't expect much from this movie in terms of story or character, but this movie had more story and character than most movies out in many many years. The acting was superb. Of course, Robert Downey Jr. delivered, and then some. But it was because of the superb acting of every actor that made them all relevant. Joss Whedon made sure every character had a significance to the story and film. And they most certainly did. I never expected much from Hawkeye, as he had barely been introduced in the Marvel Universe. But towards the end, I was cheering him on. And Scarlett Johansson's character of Black Widow had much more to it in this film than in Iron Man 2. Really, in that movie they put her in to look attractive. But in this, she had legitimate fears and doubts, and she was no longer the emotionless, fully manipulative character she was in Iron Man 2. She had a heart in the movie. Now, in terms of the Hulk, the most tricky of them, they absolutely nailed it. Ruffalo is by far the best Hulk. Great acting by him, and the Hulk, dear God marvelous! He steals the show from Iron Man at the end. Speaking of Iron Man, Tony Stark is as funny as ever, and he brilliantly shows that in the beginning he had no interest in the Avengers initiative as he had been previously rejected, but by the end, he was as much part of the team as everyone else was. They were inseparable by the end. And contrary to popular belief, Stark was not the center of the film. Whedon made sure of that. I began to care more for Cap's character as well, whom I had never been too intrigued by in his movie. And as for Thor, we can see how distressed he is by Loki leaving home, and his alienation, and that Thor cares, but that he is also willing to fulfill his duty to Asgard and all the other realms. Every single character is relevant and important, a la Joss Whedon's incredible film-making and writing skills, and the brilliance of the actors portraying them. The only gripe I could possible have is that the humor occasionally, and just occasionally, felt random, and out of place. But this is really not that big of a problem. This movie has it all: a heart, a brain, a soul, and BADASS action and awesome in its purest and most enjoyable form. I compel everyone and anyone to watch this smart, and beyond awesome film, as it is way, way better than most of the garbage that is being released nowadays. I will be seeing this again, oh yes I will. The Avengers is a masterpiece.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

1941,13 May 2012,allformsofgod,8," Despite Minor Setbacks, Avengers is Tons of Fun
","The Avengers is the long awaited superhero blockbuster that has become a living wet dream for all the Marvel fanboys (and fangirls). Now basically Hollywood made this movie for two reasons which goes as follows: 1) To have a mesmerizing and memorable set piece at the end, capitalizing on the latest special effects and bring all the comic book characters to life And.. 2)To make a godly amount of money And they've succeeded on both levels, breaking box office records and creating a finale so engrossing and entertaining it was nothing short of awesome. To see Iron Man fighting alongside Captain America while the camera pans to The Hulk raising hell, I could feel the hair on my arms raising. On this level, the film worked really well. But the first half..ehhfelt a little shaky. Now I should note that I have not ready any of the comics, nor do I know much about the Marvel universe, so I'll try my best to not seem completely ignorant. The first half was decent enough, but it definitely could have been improved (or made more exciting). All the stuff about getting the team together maybe dragged on a bit too much, and the movie didn't explain itself very well from the get go. Now maybe that's because I haven't read any of the comics, but I really think that they should have explained things a little more clearer. But this is a superhero movie, so it honestly doesn't really matter. In fact, I predicted how this movie would end before I sat down in the theater. But that doesn't matter either, the only thing that does matter is that it has the comic book characters that everyone has grown to know (and possibly love?) and that it has a lot of incredibly cool action scenes. But more on that later. The film was really good on an acting level. Some of my favorite scenes in the movie were just the characters interacting with one another. Robert Downey Jr played Robert Downey Jr and plays it perfectly. Chris Evans did well as the patriotic, out of time Captain America. Mark Ruffalo was particularly good as Bruce Banner/Hulk, although he didn't get nearly as much screen time as I would have liked. Samuel L Jackson played Rick Fury, and he definitely wasn't as Samuel L Jackson as he should have been, with the exception being his line, ""Well it's a stupid ass decision."" Jeremy Renner played Hawkeye, and I'm pretty sure that the screenwriters forgot about this character completely, and wrote him in at the last minute because Hawkeye really doesn't do anything. I like Jeremey Renner, but I feel like his was awfully miscasted in this movie. Scarlett Johansson was there to look super sexy in that black leather, but I'm still wondering why a vulnerable, attractive Russian spy is doing in a superhero team, when she doesn't have superpowers. But once again, what do I know? Tom Hiddleston plays the main villain Loki, and is without a doubt the standout role, with an amazing performance and a memorable character design, he's an actor that I'm looking forward to see in the future. And then there's Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Now I don't like this actor. I don't like Thor's character. I have no interest to see his movie and I have so many questions that I won't even bother starting. So on to the next topic, which would be the script. It's a fine script. Joss Whedon is a fine screenwriter. But if there was one thing that I had to (and will) comment on, it would be that there were FAR too many corny one liners. Some of them were funny. Most of them were stupid. The end result is that I can't even bring up any examples of the good jokes because they were buried under all the bad ones. The only person who needs to be making snappy one liners is Tony Stark, because he's an arrogant smart ass. But that's just my opinion. The script did make me laugh more times that I would have thought. And then there's the music. It was..music. Nothing standout here. I guess the other thing that I'd have to mention is the way that it's shot and edited. Sometimes it was a little jarring, it felt like they took and mashed techniques from Iron Man and Thor and Captain America, and it just ends up looking a little wonky. It never took me out of my movie experience, but every now and then the camera would tilt or reverse or the dreaded shaky cam techniques would be used, and I feel (much like the story) that it could have been a little cleaner and fluid. And now I'm done complaining. None of these things matter. Like I said, the only thing that matters is the action. And the action looks great and it's a lot of fun to watch. I barely felt it's two and a half hour running time, it was enjoyable and entertaining and even made me laugh a few times. The reveal shot of Loki in the beginning was particularly funny (although I seemed to be the only person in the theater who laughed). It even has Stan Lee in a little guest appearance towards the end. So the movie wasn't perfect, but nowadays what is? If you expect it to live up to the hype then you're going to be disappointed. But if you're looking to watch some good special effects, good fighting evil, snappy one liners and something to just turn your brain off to and shovel popcorn into your face, then this is the perfect movie. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it highly.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","If you are a big fan of superhero movies, this is the best choice for you. Plenty of supernatural power and high technology are served. Also a variety of characters too. This is the first time 6 legends of MCU met each other. Moreover, this is the debut of the villain that creates the most connection with audience. Absolutely, I can say this is a unforgettable movie.
The film started in S.H.I.E.L.D. There were a research about Tesseract, one of the most powerful weapons and energy sources that came from space. This ambition of humanity brought Loki to the world. He destroyed everything to get Tesseract and throne. Moreover, he use his wand to control Hawkeye. Therefore, S.H.I.E.L.D. had to have heroes to fight and that made 6 unique persons to be Avengers. Tony Stark, or Iron man, was the first one in Avengers. Then, Natasha, Hulk, Captain america, and Thor followed. Could they beat Loki and how? Or could they bring Hawkeye back?
I like all of the actors and actresses in this movie. They could present their characters and understand them deeply. Especially, the 6 Avengers. The first one, Robert Downey Jr. , as Iron man, he is a very high experience actor and his performance represent Tony Stark very good. His funny habit made us more enjoy in this movie. The second one, Scarlett Johansson, as Natasha, she is female delegate that as important and talent as male. Although she didn't have any supernatural power, her mind and her physical is very strong. And Johansson can do it so well. Next one, Mark Ruffalo, as Hulk, although he wasn't the first man who act as Hulk, he can handle it perfectly both human form and Hulk form. He made us believe it was a monster inside him. The fourth and also the first Avengers, Captain america, played by Chris Evan. He is the one who had highest leadership, suitable to captain's position. He could make people love Captain america even though he didn't have any supernatural power except a Vibranium shield and America flag colored suit. The last one, Hawkeye, presented by Jeremy Renner, I really like him in this movie. He did so nice in the scene he was controlled. It looked like he was really controlled.
In this film, I think it was a gorgeous to see all the Avengers met each other and fight together. The story was continuously and smoothly from the beginning to the end. On the other hand, maybe, the way to pull Hawkeye out of control had to be harder. Also the way to beat enemy.

","I went to see the movie on the third day of it's release after the whole internet was buzzing about it. Well, I submitting to the buzz! The movie isn't simply good- it's AWESOME! With the unpredictable plot, I could only guess that at the avengers will win in the end. The actors played their part realistically, and the special effects only added fuel to the scene. I absolutely love how characters that have had their own debut have been put together, to cooperate on something more epic then what they have brought as solo. The movie features characters from ""Iron Man,""""Thor,""""The Hulk,""""Black Widow,""""Captain America: the first avenger,""and a Marvel comics character ""Hawkeye."" The Avengers are summoned up by a secret agency called ""Shield,"" dealing with highly dangerous villains. The team is needed when a cube which contains unlimited power (entitled the Tesseract) is stollen from Shield's secret base. The one that stole the Tesseract is a particular Norse God of Mischief, featured in ""Thor,"" names Loki. As it occurs, Loki has come to Earth, to take over and control the planet, and the Tesseract is needed to open a portal that would invite his army to the party. I have seen ""Thor,"" and my impression on the movie wasn't as positive, I found it rather boring and unrealistic in terms of special effects and costumes. As well as back in ""Thor,"" the characters seemed plain and bordering lacking of any kind of interest in them. Unlike in the ""Avengers,"" Loki returns twice as evil, finally resembling the mischief that he is the god of. He seems to know exactly what he wants, and lives of 'pathetic mortals' as he calls humans, does not bother him. In fact, there are moments in the movie, where the actor demonstrates the character so perfectly that it is a sealed impression of him. The way Loki deviously smirks, looking savage and insane. Yet his speech proclaims him a ruler, as he yells at humans to kneel before him. Tom Hiddleston (the actor the played Loki) has perfectly presented his character.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

Yet they chose him to handle a film of this magnitude, and fortunately the producers' confidence in him paid off because this movie was a home run. My only complaint was Capt. America and how useless he seemed, being overshadowed by the others. Just give Black Widow the shield, otherwise, having both on the same team was redundant.

","The movie Avengers is a must see film for all viewers. The all-star movie fulfilled the high expectations of the world most powerful superheroes saving the human racing. Within two minutes, the movie quickly picks up after the self-sustaining energy force, that is stolen by a semi god named Loki. As gripping as the story line starts off, the special effects are just as spectacular. The headquarters ship to aircraft sequence was breathtaking enough. The effects were so realistic that it begged the question if such technology is real. Thor's sex appeal is enough to keep the ladies watching with his hammer of steel, lengthy hair and rugged style. Thor's fight with Captain America was certainly unexpected. If anything we expected an all-out war with the many quips that Tony Stark a.k.a Iron Man flings around. He brings comic relief to the otherwise tense cast. Dr. Bruce Banner a.k.a Hulk is remaining calm as ever and typically does nothing for a good part of the movie besides fondle some technology and look busy. Every once in a while, Dr.Bruce Banner comes out of his office along with Tony Stark to explain the magnitude of the energy force and the some strategic advice. Later on, he character becomes truly essential to defeating the bigger aliens. Captain America is almost as useless in the beginning because he's not up to date with any of the technology so he just sits around trying to grasp the concept most of the conversations between Mr. Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D, and the rest of the avengers. At one point he blurts out ""I get that! I understand that phrase. I do, I get that one."" Referring to a pun made by, none other than, Mr. Stark. We do however find out that Captain America is arguably the wisest of the team. Somehow he's able to slide in some subtle wisdom like ""we've got to put that (problems) behind us and get this job done"" and ""Sometimes there isn't a way out."" Iron Man earns the most improved award in this movie. He goes from a rich self-absorbed hero to a still rich, now deserving the title, hero. Sad to see but other characters didn't really change much during the film, or grow in morals. Sometimes, it's nice to see such super heroes grow into better people. Along with the almost stationary characters, the background didn't really changer either. Most of the action and plot took place of the aircraft. The movie can be dwindled down to two main back drops, the aircraft and the downtown of New York City. Combat in this movie is of epic proportions. You have the entire kick ass fighting styles of a super hero and Special Forces but without any of the excessive blood splatter that can sometimes just demean an entire movie.

","The Avengers is a behemoth of action that comic nerds and casual movie-goers alike can enjoy in the same vein. It's not only action packed, but the humor, and the script altogether, was well written and compliments each character completely. For example, Captain America speaks like how you would think: a bit dated, not exactly knowing much of his surroundings yet. He speaks as anybody who just woke up from being frozen for seventy odd years. Bruce Banner, also known as The Hulk, speaks in a sort of timid, nervous way. He mumbles a bit, and is constantly scared that something will happen that makes him very, very angry. Mark Ruffalo, the actor who plays Banner/Hulk, pulls this off gracefully as he truly is Bruce, and not just an actor playing him. Brilliant performances from the cast are a major driving point for this movie. Tony Stark is as sarcastic and witty as he normally is. Thor is awkward with his mythos and his stories of battles and what-not. In fact, Thor would be the only character that sort of didn't mesh in with the rest of the team. The actor who played him, Chris Hemsworth, didn't convince me that he was actually the character he was playing like everyone else did.

","The Avengers was a good movie, but took a little while to get into. At first I was very confused, seeing as I have not watched any of the other Marvel movies. Nothing was really explained as to who the characters were and what their importance was, it was just assumed that you knew. As I was watching the movie I asked many questions to my companions and needed things to be explained to me in order to understand everything that was going on. Without these people to clear things up I may not have understood a good portion of the movie which would have made it boring and uninteresting for me to watch. As the movie began things jumped around a lot, which made the storyline hard to follow. Characters were bouncing around from place to place and new people were being brought into the story without any real introduction or reason. Further into the movie everything came together and was more understandable, but they could have done a better job writing the beginning. Again, without explanations from the people I was with I would not have understood exactly where the character were coming from and why they were being brought it. The only reason a person would not like The Avengers, in my opinion, would be because they had not seen previous Marvel movies in which these characters were featured. Once things were explained to me and I understood the role each character played it was a very good and entertaining movie. The plot kept twisting and just when you thought something was under control it spiraled off into a huge mess. Things such as the villain freezing himself and collecting more and more power or such as the people he turned evil becoming good again just in time to help save the day. It is an action packed movie with something new and unexpected going on at all times. All of the superheroes come together in order to stop an ultra-powerful force from outer space, but their ideas and morals clash in ways that could inhibit them from making clear decisions and in the end saving the world. Besides personality clashes, the hulk is also unable to control his powers and becomes a threat to everyone when he morphs into his large green alter ego and begins to tear the place apart.

","Avengers, is a 2012 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.1 It is the sixth installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film is written and directed by Joss Whedon and features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey, Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders, Stellan Skarsgård and Samuel L. Jackson. In the film, Nick Fury, director of the peacekeeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D., recruits Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, and Thor to form a team that must stop Thor's adoptive brother Loki from subjugating Earth. The film's development began when Marvel Studios received a loan from Merrill Lynch in April 2005. After the success of the film Iron Man in May 2008, Marvel announced that The Avengers would be released in July 2011. With the signing of Johansson in March 2009, the film was pushed back for a 2012 release. Whedon was brought on board in April 2010 and rewrote the original screenplay by Zak Penn. Production began in April 2011 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, before moving to Cleveland, Ohio, in August and New York City in September.

The overall storyline is nothing special, bad guy wants to rule the world using and alien army, but the true genius of Avengers lies in its execution. Joss Whedon moves the movie along at a pace that leaves the audience without a feeling of being rushed. The threat is quickly established, but a majority of the time is spent assembling the team. Though at first one is quick to point out that this tactic would lengthen the movie and draw things out in a bore, it is another credit to the directing/writing of Whedon.

","Avengers Initiative The Avengers is an action packed film that leaves one asking for more. This film takes your classic comic book heroes and brings them to life on the big screen. From the very beginning the characters are already set in place previous movies. That is right if you don't want to be lost you unfortunately have some homework to do first. This should not be too difficult of a task. Marvel takes many of their beloved Heroes and puts them all together in a super powered formula. This team is a ""time bomb"" just waiting to explode. The characters are as different as night and day which causes many clashes from physical beat downs, to witty and comical banter between them. All the Heroes have one common goal that in the end brings them all together, the fight for the ""greater good"". The stakes are set high from the very beginning. This allows one no time to be distracted. You have Loki who is a constant threat; weather manipulated others, or fighting himself. This villain allows the watcher to be on their toes in order to know what he is really doing. He also has a slow developing scheme that becomes steadily more known and dangerous as the plot develops. One of the most interesting things about this movie is the character interactions. These vary from violent and destructive fights, to hysterical jokes. There is Tony Stark (Iron Man), a brilliant business man that is often betrayed as a large, rich child. He knows all technologies and yet, pokes and jabs at Bruce Banner to see if it will release the Hulk. Bruce Banner who is very seemingly calm at all times has as stark puts it, a big green rage monster waiting to come out. Yet he has his secret of keeping the Hulk under control. He is angry all the time. You have the super soldier that is very lost in a modern day society. An alien named Thor who blames himself for bringing this whole situation upon the earth. Then last but not least, Black Widow who you never know what she is going to do. As great as the Avengers is, it does have its flaws. If one does not know the characters nor seen the movies leading up to the Avengers, they don't know much about them. In the movie they are all already developed giving someone very little room to learn who they all are. Most of this movie is one action seen into the next leaving little time to add to the plot in between. Next to these few flaws, the Avengers is a fantastic film that takes many extraordinary fictional people and makes them feel real as the person sitting next you.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

I can say that our expectancy for the new movie ""The Avengers"" was through the roof, and we would not be happy with anything under five stars. Marvel had promised the Avengers Initiative would return, and from that point on it had been a waiting game. However, combining all of the super heroes into one great team, yet each holding their old attitudes had to take time. The wait was well worth it though; Marvel really dished it out. They produced a movie that I could watch over and over again, and never be bored. The cast was wonderful, and I can't say that there was a single actor that did not play their part perfectly. The movie was full of action, and there was never a dull moment in the humor. However, if you have not seen the other movies leading up to it, you may find yourself lost in some parts. The plot was phenomenal, and was accompanied by visual effects that put you inside the movie itself. I would highly recommend this movie to everyone, it is entertaining, humorous, and overall a blast to watch. Some of the characters showed their true colors in this movie more than in their own productions. One of my favorite quotes in the movie being Captain America's thoughts on Thor, when he says ""There is only one God, and I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that."" Aside from my thoughts, one actor that really deserves a round of applause is Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk. Through the movie he acts seamlessly from the doctor straight into the Hulk, and back.

","In 18 months on IMDb, this is my first review. I was scrolling through IMDb for some background and stumbled into the user review section. Of the first 20 or so, it seemed 15ish rated this film a ""1"". Shocked, I actually put down my phone, paused the movie, and fired up my computer just to write my first review of ANY film. I am more than willing to concede to the negative posters that the storyline is relatively predictable. However, I cannot fathom why they think it would be so easy to weave a complex story arc (like those found in Dark Knight, Star Wars, or others mentioned) that could adequately involve 4 super heroes, 3 heroes, 1.5 bad guys, and assorted support cast and come in under 5 hours. How could anyone possibly write a Batman-Joker-Dent relationship that applied to all of the Avengers? Just look at how much reel time it took to develop the Batman-Bane relationship in DKR. If I were to judge this effort solely on originality, I probably wouldn't give it a 10 either. However, I firmly believe that Mr. Whedon and company did an excellent job integrating all of the characters into an action packed story that still manages to touch (if not address) various flaws of numerous characters. I further dismiss the opinions that say there are no unexpected plot twists in the story (the death of Coulson stands out immediately to me - a beloved character from previous movies). Also, I think he manages to further develop Fury, Romanoff, and Barton despite the limited time in a movie such as this. Obviously, I think the movie was a great success and hope others will at least give it a look despite the more recent negative feedback. If I had one complaint, I think that the scenes cut involving Steve Roger's character should have been left in the original.

Worked really well together and got to show their own strength in the movie. The evil Loki didn't really get to show that much of his evil. I think they should of showed more of his evil side.

I think they should of changed the setting of the battle that happened in Manhattan, where the bad guys went against the heroes .The ending kind of made you think there was going to be a second one coming out, and not leave you hanging like most other movies. The best scene I think was the best in the movie was when all of them were stopping the portal thing that Loki had opened and they all came together.It showed how even though they have different techniques on fighting there enemy that can still help each other and defeat the enemy.

","Joss Wheldon's ""The Avengers"" is a fusion of recent Marvel movies like Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk and Captain America. Whether or not you have seen the movies parts wont make sense unless you're a Marvel fanatic. It's an action, comedy, sci-fi movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat but laughing at the same time. If you're anything like me, the movie will irritate you throughout. Knowing that it's a bunch of movies mixed in, I began to question myself if some characters I didn't recognize are in other movies like the black guy with the eye patch or the girl spy that seemed a little to porn star and her partner. If you were comic book reader you would know they were Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Nick Fury. Loki is Thor's adopted brother who tries to take over the world and become the leader. I feel like Loki's thought that we have to much freedom is inaccurate. In America we are lucky but a lot of the world isn't as fortunate. Loki's idea to rule the world because of this is not thought through. The Avengers are sent out to stop him and his invading army. The production quality was successful. After watching the movie I was curious as to what was actually real in the movie and what was special affects. The distinction was seamless, unlike the production of Alien, which is what these aliens remind me of. I would recommend watching it at night because it is so dark at times it's almost impossible to see. On the other hand the acting in this movie was outstanding. When it comes to the plot, the creativity was good. The characters have the same personality as in their own movies but are mixed in with jointly in such a way that the characters play off each other. It involves examples of real life human emotions, rationality and faults but is done in a premature way. I feel like the conflicts between the team are silly and felt unreal. This movie has many clichés in it. For example, why does the epidemic always seem to happen in NYC? Why do our leaders feel the need to bomb every place that they can't deal with? Why do the characters always have to argue and then make up at the end? Why does the Hulk never talk until the end? In conclusion the Movie was an overall success. The production quality was amazing along with the acting. The movie was very entertaining and well done.

","Joss Whedon's ""Marvel's The Avengers"" is a wonderfully crafted and delightfully surprising detour from the prevalent ""Super Hero blockbuster"" film formula. There has been constant chatter about an Avengers film for years among super hero fans, even long before the film was announced. Ever since Spiderman opened the door for film adaptations of the sizeable Marvel super hero roster. If the Marvel universe was going to be put to the screen, an Avengers film was an obvious choice for a finale (of sorts, there will almost certainly be sequels to ""The Avengers""). Film buffs and comic book gurus alike expressed growing uncertainty at the prospect somewhere around the time of the disappointing Spiderman 3 and Thor films, though Captain America and the Iron Man movies were almost unanimously well received. The hesitation was mostly due to the way recent super hero movies have been produced. Too often we were forced to acknowledge awkward pacing, convoluted and ineffective plot lines, excessive reliance on special effects, flat dialogue, and questionable camera work, to name a few complaints from a very long list. When it was announced that Whedon would be at the helm, many were reassured and anticipation grew.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","The Avengers delivers on being a great superhero movie with quality special effects and an entertaining plot while also making the audience laugh throughout the entire movie. The opening scene causes suspense with a very dark scene of Loki being given his scepter by his master. It also shows their creepy looking army and their goal of capturing the Tesseract, a cube of great power. The line of ""What can the humans do but burn"" foreshadows that they are going attack the humans. Loki uses his scepter and the power of the Tesseract to teleport from Asgard to Earth. He then steals the Tesseract from the humans. This causes the director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Nick Fury, to call together all of the world's superheroes. These heroes are Iron Man, the Hulk, Captain America, Hawkeye, Thor, and Black Widow and they try to stop Loki and his Chitauri army from taking over the world while also dealing with internal conflicts between heroes. The introduction of the Avengers is very well done because they show each one being recruited back into the Avengers. They do a great job of incorporating the backstories of each one by referencing their individual movies. The dialogue is used to explain each hero's background to the audience so it would appeal to everyone and not just hardcore comic and superhero fans. Flashbacks are used to explain some details of the past histories of the characters. Loki and Captain America both have flashbacks and Captain America's shows his past experience with the Tesserract. The special effects are used to make the sci-fi parts of the movie seem possible. The blue cube of the Tesseract is beautifully created with blue swirls inside of it. The transformation of Bruce Banner into the Hulk is very well done with him going mad and then slowly growing into the Hulk and the Hulk looks giant, ripped and very green when he is smashing everything. The futuristic looking ships and aircraft are made to look very complex by having very detailed electronic and mechanical parts and the helicarrier is a great example because it is an aircraft carrier that turns into a flying helicopter ship with four giant engines. The movie also includes plenty of comic relief. Phil Coulson is asking Captain America if he will sign his vintage collection of Captain America cards every time he sees him. There is a great moment when one of the workers on the helicarrier is playing galaga instead of working and Tony Stark calls him out for it. The constant references of modern things, like Stephen Hawking, made to Captain America are funny because he doesn't understand any of them. Some of the most memorable moments are comic relief moments with Captain America ordering Hulk to smash before the final battle and when Loki gives his little speech to the Hulk and then the Hulk picks him up and smashes him into the ground multiple times. The Avengers shows that superhero movies can also be funny.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

He was the genius that was able to turn Steve Rodgers into Captain America and giving him his powers by experimenting on him; making him into a great success.

Not Dark and Gritting Enough? I Loved the Dark Knight but not every movie has to follow that formula (see Amazing Spider-Man, Man Of Steel).

I remember leaving the theater and already I Couldn't wait for the second one. Joss Whedon is one of the greatest writers in the industry (see Buffy, Firefly etc.) and knows his comics (see his run on Astonishing X- Men and Runaways) making him the perfect choice for this movie. It has action and humor and all you could want from a blockbuster movie. Granted, it looks better on the Big Screen, in which case this review is too late, but none the less, if you're a fan of blockbuster movies this is the cream of the crop. If you aren't then be smart enough not to go see it.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012
2085,29 December 2013,JariosMiShonCourtney,10," Avengers Come Alive
","Although some May not be huge fans of the traditional comic books, The Avengers are placed into reality by science fiction animation and an outstanding ""All Star"" cast. At some point in the average persons life they have heard of Captain America, Iron Man, Hawkeye, The Hulk or the God of lightening, Thor. These characters have been apart of the American culture for decades and at last they all come to life. This movie highly recommended as a must see. It has all the elements for a nonstop, action-packed family movie. It is shear genius that the plot for this film be intertwined and ran off from the other previous movies that the Avengers starred in individually. I do agree that some parental guidance should be suggested based on some scenes being potentially violent. Overall, I give this film the highest rating do to the outstanding cast, Director influence, costumes design, plot of the movie and awesome display of special effects used to place the movie together.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012
2086,20 September 2021,laurelwoodland,4," Boring
","One of those movies where no amount of crazy action sequences and effects can make you care about what's happening. The concept of The Avengers is cool, but for someone who hasn't read any of the comics I was neither excited nor invested in the characters. Boring and lacking substance, it gives the normal blockbuster formula and not much else. And yes, I have watched it more than once, each time expecting to enjoy it more than the last, but alas I never do.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012
2087,10 February 2014,wizaddora-920-262092,," The adaptation comic in movies
","The success of The Avengers film is a result of the brilliant Marvel's history and its ideas. The Marvel Universe has grown a lot since its beginning in the 1950s. What started as a series of comic books would become one of the most popular entertainment franchises in the world. Marvel has since expanded to explore mediums such as comic books (of course), short films, feature films, video games, and a television series all based on characters from the Marvel Universe. This process made the Marvel to a big fantastic factory of dreams.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","Marvels The Avengers, or commonly known as The Avengers is an action packed film based on a combination of a series of superhero movies that were all produced by Marvels. The Avengers are an assembly of heroes including Ironman played by Robert Downey Jr., Thor played by Chris Hemsworth, The Incredible Hulk played by Mark Ruffalo, and Captain America played by Chris Evans. After an unexpected enemy begins to threaten the security of the world, Nick Fury, played by Samuel L. Jackson, and his partner, played by Scarlett Johansson, gathers these heroes in order to try to provide peace from the enemy and save the world from crumbling. Though this movie was slow to develop and seemed to drag on at parts through the introduction, the action picks up as the movie proceeds with a well-developed cohesion of parts by the conclusion of the film.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012
2089,11 April 2014,Tyler7397,9," Brilliant film
","I love the way Marvel have brought Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk and Thor together. The plot is brilliant and I especially like the 'Battle of New York' scene where Hawkeye, Black Widow, Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk and Thor fight against Loki and Thanos' armies in the middle of New York outside Stark Tower as it is full of action. I also like the way although it is an action film there are aspects of a comedy film in it as I found some parts of the film funny. It is one of the best films that I have ever seen and I really enjoyed watching it! Overall it is an exceptionally brilliant film that I would strongly recommend!",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

2091,2 June 2014,rathertfamily,9," Avengers is awesome!
","Marvel's The Avengers is a fantastic movie! Director Josh Wheldon did a fantastic job creating this movie. I highly recommend it to watch, but beware to those with young children...this movie should hold true to the PG-13 rating it was given. There is some language and intense battle scenes. But the overall message is great you have to come together to conquer evil. This movie gets that message across in a unique way of pulling together the world's best superheroes: Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and the Hulk. All the characters have been previously developed through other Marvel movies, which will help your understanding of this movie a lot more if you watch them in advance. Also, it never fails to amaze me how Marvel always manages to work in the cameo appearance of their founder and comic book writer, Stan Lee. I look for him in ever Marvel movie now. The overall basis of the movie is that Loki, Thor's not so nice little brother, is trying to take by the Tesseract, a blue cube that is an energy source and can connect multiple worlds. SHIELD, led by Nick Fury, pulls together the best superheroes to protect all people from Loki. Through a complicated, but well scripted and funny plot, the movie ends in a huge battle. Which you'll have to watch the movie to see how that goes... It really is a great movie with a well planned out cast and an amazing script. One of my favorite quotes is ""There is only one God, ma'am, and I'm pretty sure He doesn't dress like that"", said by Captain America. SO surprising that modern Hollywood will still say something towards Christianity; it was refreshing. Overall an amazing way to kill a couple of hours! I recommend it to anyone who likes action with a side of comedy.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012

","I enjoyed watching Avengers. I liked the hulk that came on the 2008 film better than the Avengers. He looked more real and lean. Avengers Hulk looked more bulking. Being in the gym as a weightlifter and a runner, I know how a runners physique looks like. Hulk runs,crushes, jumps, and does a lot of running. His physical ability to me does not fit with a bulky look. I hope your future movies get more thought before putting on film. Can not wait to see your future films. I hope you keep the same actors for these films. Actor that played in Avengers was more appealing to me than the 2008 film. I like your films when its 50/50 on solving the problem and action.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012
2094,9 August 2015,eduardpopa1999,8," A noob opinion.
","Hello, that review is specially for the people who aren't fans of superheroes films. I'm not a superheroes films fan, specially on marvel films (The best was Spiderman), I prefer DC comics, but in that time I enjoy the film. The film was great, whit a good history and good special effects too. If you want to see a superheroes film, but realistic, that isn't your film, maybe you go to see a Dc comics film, because Marvel had a crazy unrealistic ideas, but if you like superpowers, and the magician that' your film. I like specially this film because appears many different heroes, whit different powers and different attitude. Before I saw that film, I think that it can't be a good film, but now I've a different opinion, maybe you when finish the film your opinion change too. PD: That's my first review and I'm not from a English country, maybe I've grammatical mistakes.",/review/rw3303965/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Assemble_(2012
