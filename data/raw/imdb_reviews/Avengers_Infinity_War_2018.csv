0,24 January 2021,RJBrez,10," Best movie of the MCU, incredible from start to finish.
","Infinity War is remembered mostly for how it ends, with good reason. But for me, the entire movie is incredible. Action, humor, cinematography, heartbreak, etc. It was a culmination of 10 years of character development. The benefit of that hard work? The movie can start with incredible action and never let up. Most wouldn't agree because of the ending, but I feel it's the best movie of the MCU (so far). Endgame was awesome, infinity war was better. I think the best part of it was the fact that we had so many cool character meet ups that as fans we never thought we'd see. Thor with the guardians? Wow. Star Lord and Iron Man? Rocket and the winter soldier? We could go on and on. They also mastered the art of humor to help offset some deep deep hurt throughout the story. Thor and Star Lords interactions are pure gold. Thor calling Rocket ""rabbit"" pure gold. Dr Strange and Tony going toe to toe is worth the price of admission as well. I'm going to stop now or I could type forever.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty.

2,5 February 2021,Alex_Lo,10," Best Cliffhanger of all Time
","A meticulously planned film down to the last detail, where you can see how much love is behind it. Of course, the film delivers impressive show values and action, but besides, it is above all the interactions of the characters that are well thought out. Surprisingly, no character is neglected, and all the storylines of the previous films are brought together amazingly logical. The end is for me one of the best cliffhangers of all time, after the movie I was whacked. In the end, I have to ask myself: What more do I expect from a comic book superhero film? I was perfectly happy, so I can also give a comic book adaptation 10 out of 10 stars.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","Infinity war is one of the best MCU protects. It has a great story, great acting, and awesome looking. If you aren't a Marvel fan or haven't watched most of the previous MCU movies this however, won't be something for you. Let's start with Thanos, definitely one of the best villains, he has a motive, is well played, you can even say that Infinity war tells his story and not the story of a hero.

","Avengers infinity war is an emotional roller coaster. Using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain, the movie successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics. Joe and Anthony Russo create a superhero movie that it's every bit the epic that it needs to be. However prepared you feel, you are not ready for Thanos.

7,5 February 2021,Abdulxoxo,8," A superior avengers sequel
","Although this film has 'Avengers' in the title, it ultimately belongs to Thanos. It's his story that drives the whole plot. He is the main characters of this movie, not any of the heroes. Thanos in my opinion is the greatest villain the MCU has ever produced. as a character he is truly threatening. In most of these movies deep down I know the hero will always win. For the first time I wasn't sure if the hero would win or not. Through the movie's entirety I was on the edge of my seat wandering whether my favourite characters would actually make it out of the movie alive. To have a villain with that level of genuine threat I thought was fantastic. I also felt slightly conflicted by his motivations. On the face of it, planning to eliminate half the universe's population is obviously a bad thing; however, after we learn his motivations for wanting to do so, I'd be lying if I didn't say I understood where he was coming from. There are two tones at play in this movie. One of them is a comical tone, mostly coming from the Guardians, Thor and Spider-Man. Predominantly though this movie is dark. Because of the level of threat created by Thanos, there is an emotional aspect to this film that will take the viewer by surprise. There are plenty of large scale action sequences, which are amazing; but there are also some shocking moments that were difficult to deal with. What I can say is that, the running time of two and a half hours absolutely flew by.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018
8,21 April 2021,Puroo,10," How MCU should have always been like
","It was only after the release of Infinity War that I got interest in MCU. Before that I wasn't very much into superhero movies. So a couple of months after this movie released, I skimmed through all the MCU movies from Iron Man to Black Panther. I didn't put much focus into watching them all, since most of them were just following one pattern. Iron Man? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Captain America? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Thor? A guy ""loses"" and then gets superpowers, beats the bad guy and saves the day. Even in The Avengers and Age of Ultron it's just ""now all those guys come together, beat the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and save the day"". But Avengers: Infinity War is very much different.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

He is by far the most interesting MCU villain: strong, nuanced and perfectly performed by Brolin. This really is HIS movie. The film has a train like speed and one impressive sequence is followed by the next. Especially the banter between Thor and the Guardians and Iron Man vs Strange is what makes these Marvel films so fun to watch. Great climatic ending (a well ending...).

","Over the past decade, Marvel has earned itself the benefit of the doubt. The studio has consistently delivered smart, funny, brave films that both embrace and transcend their comic-book origins. The 18 blockbuster movies produced since Iron Man first blasted off into the stratosphere in 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films as a genre - they've helped to legitimise it. Indeed, Marvel's two most recent films - Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther - have received the kind of accolades usually reserved for edgy arthouse flicks.

19,24 April 2018,garethvk,10," A Summer Film That IS Even Better Than The Hype
","Summer movies often hype themselves as spectacular events not to be missed and their ad campaigns use words like ""epic"", ""spectacle"", and ""smash"" as ways to build the hype to increase advanced box office sales.
The summer 2018 film season kicks off in a big way with ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and it is the rare summer film that exceeds is lofty expectations and delivers a crowning achievement for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
When Thanos (Josh Brolin), embarks on a deadly campaign to find and possess the Infinity Stones, he leaves a path of death and destruction in his path. When his pursuit leading him to Earth, Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), who enlist a reluctant Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), to the cause just as the minions of Thanos arrive.
With The Avengers fractured and scattered following the events of ""Captain America: Civil War"" the teams find themselves dealing with the threat in various groups as fate steps in to divide many key members of the team. This allows for a great entry by the Guardians of the Galaxy and allows the film to take a very enjoyable path. Essentially the movie weaves separate storylines into one cohesive and very satisfying epic. You have a story with the Guardians as well as one with many of the key Avengers, as well as others with characters old and new. As such it is like a Guardians, Avengers, and Marvel film all rolled into one and each one supports the other very well yet has the charm and identity you would expect. While the tone is very dark as you would expect with literally half of the known universe facing destruction, there is also some solid humor in the film that never once undermines the story or pacing.
Naturally the effects are stunning as you would expect as Marvel has put a significant amount of money into the film and it shows in every eye-popping action sequence.
What really impressed me the most was that the Russo Brothers never let the FX of the film overshadow the characters and with a very large cast, it was nice to see everyone got their moment and you did not see members of the cast trying to one up each other.
There are some real surprise moments along the way and the action is easily the best of any Marvel film to date. Many fans had expressed disappointment with ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" for me this film is significantly better than the prior film and is everything that a Marvel fan would want in a film.
I was also surprised by how well Thanos was portrayed as while you hopefully will not agree with his deductions and methods; you could actually understand his motivations and it help him transcend from the usual megalomaniacs which are so common in films of his type. I am really looking forward to seeing what comes next and make sure you stay through the credits for a bonus scene.
Believe the hype, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an epic not to be missed and is an example of what a summer event film should be.

","Infinity War does a brilliant job by seamlessly combining the last few films together. It picks up where Ragnarok left off on the space shuttle with Thor, Loki, Hulk and all the remaining Asgardians. It opens with a distress call as Thanos and his Dark Order have slaughtered most of passengers including some of the remaining Asgardians. He interrogates Thor and beats Hulk so bad he is too scared to ever turn green again. A defeated Hulk/Bruce Banner is then transported to Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum so he can warn him of Thanos' arrival. It is down to Doctor Strange, Wong, Tony Stark and Spider Man to prevent Thanos' evil minions from destroying New York and taking the time stone. It's a thrilling action sequence that introduces Starks cool new nano-bot armour that creates its own swords and shields. ",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

23,4 May 2018,Horst_In_Translation,8," Taking the genre to the next level
","""Avengers: Infinity War"" is the newest addition to the now already long-running Marvel superhero franchise and in my opinion this movie is a definite contender for best installment of all. These 2.5 hours were directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, who started with Community and then entered the Marvel world with Captain America and for this new Avengers movie, they reunited with writers Markus and McFeely. Let me start by saying that I was a bit critical about previous Marvel films, especially Avengers movies as they frequently united way too many characters without properly elaborating on most of them. And the stories about them failing on their own against the villains, but eventually managing to succeed as a team after overcoming their conflicts and differences was gently-speaking not too new or creative. But this one here is different. Almost all characters have their moment to shine really, well Black Widow could have had a little more than that Hulk moment, but she is the exception. Even those they added new now like the Guardians of the Galaxy and the characters from Black Panther add their fair share of material worth seeing. Peter Dinklage is pretty interesting and memorable as a dwarf (yep!), the stories on romance and male friendship are nice to watch too and even Benedict Cumberbatch is tolerable for once.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018
24,6 September 2021,Dello_,10," The standard for every crossover movie
","Though this is not my favorite MCU movie I think ""Infinity War"" is the best product the studio produced both because of the really high scope and because of the execution itself. I think the movie is so great because it contains almost everything you could ask (action, humor, heartfelt moments, great CGI, fantastic score, ...) in a balanced way. Furthermore even if the culmination of the MCU happened in ""Endgame"" it was here that every piece of the Marvel Universe was brought together for the first time. I remember to have an astronomical hype at the time and the fact that the movie resulted to be even better than what my hype was making envisioning me is something that I highly count. But the best part of this movie is its villain, Thanos. I loved him (and still do) and he absolutely stole the show and sets up Endgame perfectly. Clearly ""Infinity War"" has its flaws and I am not here to say it is perfect like a 10/10 rating would usually mean, but for what it represented at the time and the way it was delivered I think we couldn't have asked for more.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

I get that there was an insane amount of hype around this film, and it's awesome to see our favorite Marvel characters come together (The Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor, Spiderman, Captain America, Black Panther, etc.), but we shouldn't let our excitement over all of our favorite characters coming together cloud the fact that ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an overly long movie that relies on cheap, unbelievable deaths to generate excitement and that isn't particularly well written or edited.

54,6 August 2018,phoenixinvictus,1," Worst Marvel Movie Ever With a Huge (or tiny) Plot Hole
","I can almost guess how the sequel is going to go... they are going to use some ridiculous time travel trick to undo all of Thanos damage. This two and a half hour movie was nothing more than a ten minute cameo for each actor to fight some alien.
The HUGE plot hole in this movie is Thanos ""plan"" and Ant-Man's mysterious absence in this movie. Let's see how absurd the plot hole of this movie is... Thanos' master plan is to wipe out half the population of the Universe because according to him there aren't enough resources for us all. Have you seen the size of the Universe??? The resources are almost endless! The Universe is a BIG place people! How can anyone not point that out to him? With his magic gauntlet complete he can just ""magic"" all the resources he wants with the snap of his fingers. Duh! But that is not all... Ant-Man possesses the technology to END WORLD HUNGER!!! All he needs to do is supersize ""a steak"" to the size of a ""truck"" and presto you can feed an entire city for weeks. Right there is the weapon to end Thanos' dumb logic.
Almost right in the beginning of the movie Thanos kills off the Asgardians on the ship, except for the main characters because... well just because we'll dump logic out of window and not bother the audience. Thanos then kills Loki-for REAL this time. Let me please have a moment to laugh out loud ha ha ha ha ha ha ha HA HA HA HA HA! Even if Loki is really dead this time I cannot feel anything but amusement at this ridiculous death for he has died so many times that I have lost count! Why should I feel sorry for a guy who wanted humans to worship him as a living god? Wasn't this the guy who literally placed his father in an old folks home to rot away? Wasn't he the one responsible for starting a war of genocide? Wasn't he the one who was responsible for the death of tens of thousands of people and caused the near destruction of New York City? Wasn't he the one who caused the invasion of New York City by aliens?
Let's face facts! Nearly every Marvel character has died and been brought back to life that it actually is getting boring!
Heimdall who is wounded uses the last of his powers to transport Hulk\Bruce Banner to Earth in an effort to warn the Avengers instead of-I don't know- beaming the tesseract away from Thanos. How about sending it to the edge of the Universe? It's not like he has a locating beacon to find these things.
Gamora wants to stay away from Thanos because she knows something that he wants and makes Star Lord promise her he will kill her (yeah right). Gamora then does the very thing she said she wouldn't do and runs directly to Thanos to engages him in battle where we all know that she will lose.
Aliens attack New York again. What an unlucky city. Doctor Strange is abducted and Wong doesn't seem to care that his friend is in danger and returns home... Really Wong, I'm so disappointed with you! Why doesn't he open up a portal to rescue his BFF? I know that Doctor Strange wouldn't have abandoned him... of course there is the fact that Wong's ten minutes were up and the studio couldn't afford him. Okay Wong I forgive you. Doctor Strange doesn't use his magic gem to turn back time and ""bargain"" with Thanos. Why doesn't he do it? With the help of Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Spiderman and Star Lord they hatch up a ""plan"" to remove the magic gauntlet off Thanos rather than just cut off the guy's arm off! Star Lord being the screw up that he is screws up the entire plan. Doctor Strange simply gives up the time gem because it's the only way to prolong this agonizing movie for another hour! Why didn't I just stop watching this movie?
Captain America who is a fugitive is suddenly pardoned because he is just so darn good looking and awesome in his costume. Vision says that he won't trade a life for a life but there were so many lives lost during the battle to remove the stone from his head. Wakanda is invaded and the Hulk refuses to come out of the closet... So why was he saved and not someone else? Does anyone care? Why didn't Wong and his friends appear in the final battle and lock the evil alien army into the ""mirror dimension""? I'm just saying... Everyone dies and we all know that they aren't going to stay that way. These movies get worse and worse each year.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

Winter soldier and Ragnarok , one being very serious the other choosing a very light and sarcastic approach ( almost parody like ) for their subjects , both i think did a far better job than this . As infinity war stumbles between being dark and fun and ends up tedious and stupid , characters do stuff which makes zero sense Heimadall can see all but he could not see Thanoses big ass ship ? Loki is holding the stone and he sends Hulk to earth ? Thanos acquires all the stones , becomes the most powerful being in the universe but has to kill people to save the universe ? cant he.. i don't know make the resources infinite and be everyone's hero ? If no , then why did it take him this long to act upon his plans ? Heroes run head on towards the bad guys LOTR style ? Its the 21 century guys humans don't fight that way you know , Thor has the power of lightening and thunder but needs an axe ? then why didn't he just chop off Thanoses head ? And the most important question , who invented these stones and don't they have something to say about how these things are used ? You see this is what makes a movie this big this bad . And since we are sure that the people who died are bound to be revived again ( don't bring visions back that guy is a nightmare ) there is no sense of tragedy or loss just a very lame move to pull on our heart strings .",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","AVENGERS:INFINITY WAR,to say in one line,is perfectly balanced as all things should be. It was the most anticipated movie of the decade,and it had to deliver what seemed impossible-bringing together two dozen superheroes,combining plot threads from the previous 18 films,introducing the biggest villain onscreen and perfectly balancing humor with emotions and action with drama-all in a single film-and the russos nailed it.... Mild Spoilers follows... The main attraction of the film ,is no doubt the Mad Titan. Thanos is not your usual villain. He is complex and multi-dimensional. He is cruel,ruthless,kills but at the same time, he mourns,shows compassion,and above all-he has a reason for his actions-and that's what makes him the most interesting and dangerous villain. He gets the most screen time than any other hero...It is as if he is the central character. Its as if we are following his journey of collecting the six infinity stones so that he can destroy half the universe. He wants to wipe out half of the universe,not because he sees fun in it nor he wants to rule. All he wants is to achieve balance in the universe. According to him if the universe is left unchecked,then the universe might destroy itself due to overpopulation. He wants to do this action so that the other half and the future generations can thrive....he describes it as mercy. Along with him ,the film also gave us sidekick antagonists in the form of black order. Among them,Ebony maw was cool to watch. The actions and choreography were amazing. If you thought the actions in the trailers were awesome,o boy...u aint seen nothing. The people behind the camera ..they did a fantastic job. The art work was good ...and the cgi and vfx looked realistic. They did a remarkable job in capturing all the facial expressions in josh brolins face. Nothing to say about screenplay...its just ....I cant imagine how they delivered it ..and like a star wars movie we got to see different parts of the galaxy-From the sanctum sanctorum to New avengers facility. From wakanda to New york. From Nevidilir to knowhere and from vormir to titan and finally to wakanda...The shifting of story from one scene to another scene and location without confusing the plot was executed perfectly. The dialogues were sensible..and the film is filled with lots of pretty and punchy one liners that will fill you with laughter,and some that will make you emotional. The character interactions...well this was what we wanted to see more than anything...and trust me ,the russo brothers delivered more than what we expected. Not only that, the film gives adequate time for characters to grow and develop in such a short time frame that you feel for each and every character ...its a treat for those who have followed all mcu films and had made the characters part of their life.....the interaction between these different characters is what makes this film unique.....there are reunions...there are first meetings..the plot is written as such that each and every character is vital to the story... The guardians get a lot of screen time...and Thor-guardians interactions are one of the best and most entertaining moments in the film .The trio formed by dr strange,peter parker and tony stark was also very amazing..The first meeting between earths mightiest heroes and the guardians of the galaxy is very funny ...The thanos-gamora relationship is very well explored ..the film also gives ample time to vision-scarlett witch romance that was teased in the trailers... captain america has a grand entry ..we get to see black panther...bruce banner ..o well he has his own arc in the film and is funny.. and so on...
Its the darkest and most emotional movie in the franchise..as the first scene itself sets the tone for the entire film. The stakes are higher than ever and the ENDING will just make you numb .....,
Its not just a superhero movie..Its a movie about love,relationship,sacrifice and above all asks a moral question- ""under what condition is it just to trade one innocent life to save others"".",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","I have basically nothing but praise for Avengers: Infinity War. Considering the rest of the movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) are very safe and don't take many risks or deviate from their generic formula, this does. These movies will go down in cinema history, for better or for worse, and I do truly believe this deserves to be there.
There are plenty of reasons this is the best MCU instalment and one of the better movies of the decade:
The primary reason is the villain, Thanos. He played spectacularly by Josh Brolin, who even in motion capture gets all the acting through. The MCU has had such weak villains throughout so to see Thanos done so well is a great change. I think the genius behind how Thanos is the best villain is because the way the movie cleverly poses the question ""Could he be right?"". This gives him not only a sense of moral righteousness to us but we can truly see the ""No one thinks they're the villain"" philosophy making him so compelling. The opening scene of the movie shows the mad titan effortlessly slaughtering families in his quest to destroy half the population of the universe. He seems completely unfazed by this like he's done it before countless times. There is a clever line of exposition in this after this, not only backing it up that he has (That we will see a flash back showing he's been doing it for at least 20 years) but also how he got the first stone. I like this decision to say rather than show this as it puts us in the action of the people we actually have emotional resonance with, The Asgardians. Throughout this scene we see the two previously strongest characters, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), get not only beat down by Thanos but humiliated. This is especially prevalent in the hulk as we don't see the fight between Thor and Thanos. We do get to see the fight between The Hulk and Thanos however. This is one of the best set pieces in the franchise as not only is it bombastic action but also shows character for both of them, but especially Thanos. Through a mere few counterattacks, Thanos decimates The Hulk. This shows the brains he has, not fighting like the animal The Hulk does, and showing he also has the strength to go toe to toe with the previous strongest avenger. The genius behind the decision to show the brains is that t circles back to when in the final fight he says ""You're not the only one cursed with knowledge"". In this scene we also see the smarts of Thanos, outsmarting the God of Mischief-Loki (Tom Hiddleston). He ultimately kills both Loki and Heimdall (Idris Elba), the final remaining people from Thor's previous life before the first Thor and the avengers. I think the next time we see Thanos on screen is in the Knowhere scene. In this he uses his grip over the weapons he has gathered, showing their abilities and his ability over them by cutting through The Guardians of the Galaxy (Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Pom Klementieff) with ease and going as far as to turn our beloved Mantis and Drax into Spaghetti and just blocks respectively. There is a lot more in this scene which I could talk about, Peter's arrogance and the Guardians dysfunctional family ultimately leading to their downfall to the hand of a competent villain, but I will elect to talk on the emotional climax of the scene, Peter Quill attempting to kill the love of his life in order to save humanity but getting the rugged pulled out from underneath him. This leaves Peter in a complete state of disarray as if he had killed he would have felt immense guilt for killing the one true love of his life, and if he hadn't then he may have just doomed the universe. No win situations like these are perfect for developing character as we get to see them in difficult situations. This drives Peter and the rest of The Guardians the rest of the movie. There is two more Thanos scenes I would like to would like to talk about: the first of which is the Nebula torture scene. This is a truly perfect scene compared to the many others. Marvel has a tendency to crack jokes unnecessarily, which I'll get into later, but this is just completely devoid of all that humour which is just perfect. The fact Gamora says ""I always hated that chair"" and Thanos deciding to bring himself to the lower level, not feeling the need to assert his dominance over her sets up the next scene perfectly, and then the other thing in this scene is the decision for the 'Mad Titan' no to torture Gamora and instead torturing Nebula, again this makes the next scene perfectly. Then the final scene of the Thanos chat is the Vormir/Soul Stone scene. This scene is just chilling. When Red Skull (Ross Marquand) pronounces that you must give a soul you love for the soul stone, the reactions from both Thanos and Gamora are just amazing. Thanos goes completely silent, null and void he thinks over what he must do. The tear shed shows the pain perfectly set up in the previously alluded scene, but understanding he must do what he must do. In his eyes it means crossing the fate over the universe over his daughter and the only person he ever truly loved. Gamora in this scene is fantastic as well. She originally believes that Thanos doesn't love anyone and therefore he will fail, going as far as to taunt him about it. At the beginning the taunts come thick and fast but they slow down with her voice realising there's only one thing he loves. The climax of Gamora trying to kill herself instead of having to give the stone to Thanos is what makes the scene so great, giving the moral compass of The Guardians and she carries that to her grave ultimately.
Another reason for this being this being the best instalment in the franchise is because of the writing and acting for/from every character:
Iron Man is the man who started all this and Robert Downey Jr. gives a trademark performance. He brings the narcissism and arrogance that comes with the character. He also shows the swagger but more he brings arguably the fourth personality trait of Iron Man's tenure. This iteration brings the most human Iron Man. He has always had obsessions but in this the obsession is with having a child. This is started as far back as Captain America: Civil War (2016) with the introduction of Spider-Man (Tom Holland). In this Spider-Man was easily the youngest superhero, he was still in high school, so Tony Stark saw him as a child, which later became his child of sorts. This is emanated as the same you want to push your child but not to the point of harm, Tony brings Peter Parker into the fight to expand the help for Team Iron Man or whatever it's called, but at the first sign of real danger he tells him to leave. This is carried over to Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) where we see Iron Man as the mentor, Uncle Ben figure of the MCU. To those who don't understand that, Uncle Ben in Spider-Man is the man who teaches Peter humility and ""With great power comes great responsibility"". Tony Stark has this trait in this as he teaches Peter not to thrill-seek and do it for the greater cause, what Tony Stark had to learn 9 years prior in the first instalment of the MCU, Iron Man (2008). I say all of this because he gets annoyed at Peter for getting on the spaceship as he is fully aware that it could be a one way trip. The line Peter says ""I can't be the friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man if there's no neighbourhood"" encapsulates the lessons taught to him in the previous instalments of his character in other MCU movies. Then to see Peter die in his arms has to be the killing blow, comparable to losing a child. Not only does Tony feel this, but because of all the time spent developing their relationship in other movies and this one, we the audience also feel this like the dagger Tony Stark has just been stabbed with, both physically and emotionally. The back and forth between Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Iron Man is brilliant, it evokes the feeling when two of the worlds greatest but heads, like Messi and Ronaldo or Lebron and Curry. The ""I speak for myself"" from Doctor Strange is completely unnecessary and he just affirms Tony Stark's point but it shows however on the same tea, they are very much at each other's throats. This is even more apparent when in the spaceship Tony and Peter save Doctor Strange by blowing a hole and releasing the vacuum. Doctor Strange doesn't thank the pair but proceeds to make an indirect threat to them, saying he will not hesitate to not save them in aid to keep the Time stone. Also another 'alpha' character in Peter Quill joins them on Titan. This throws another problem as he has no willingness to listen to anyone but himself.
Thor is clearly fighting out of vengeance towards Thanos. Though not all by the hand of Thanos, in the last 3 features of Thor he has lost his father-Odin (Anthony Hopkins), his mother-Frigga (Rene Russo), his brother-Loki, and his four of his best friends in Heimdall and the warriors three (Jamie Alexander, Zachary Levi, Ray Stevenson and Tadanobu Asano). This man has seen everyone die around him so the guilt he must feel is through the roof. This is said by Mantis when trying to empathise with him. He is very much motivated in this by vengeance, it is because of this he is so powerful as he has ""Nothing left to lose"". This gives Thor the reckless abandon needle to take on Thanos alone or take the weight of a star to form his weapon. The will to take the weight, heat and energy of a star shows how much he was connected to Mjolnir. In very much way the the Tardis feels like a person in Doctor Who (1963-Present), Mjolnir had a sense around it that it was more than just a weapon, not just how Thor and it interacted but it's perfect timing and the noise it makes feeling like a language. Speaking of people Thor has lost, Mjolnir in Thor: Ragnarok (2017) was destroyed early by Hela (Cate Blanchett).

","Firstly, special effects were really good, cast was also very good! I grew up reading these comics and Thanos along with Doctor Doom were my two favorite bad guys!
Thanos is very good in this film, it's just the writers obviously don't know the comics very, or just think they are better than the likes of Stan Lee and Jim Starlin who
was the person that created Thanos. Thanos kills to please Lady Death, he does not kill just because he thinks there's to many people, what a stupid idea that was.
I mean if he is worried about there not being enough resources for the population, once he has the infinity gauntlet, he can solve that by creating enough resources for
everyone! It would have been so simple to have Thanos worshipping Lady Death, her just silently watching, and him, as in the comics trying to gain her attention by 
killing to please her, but that was to complicated for the writers to put in, as audiences would not know who she was, lol. Self explained by Thanos, easily done, 
we've not seen the dwarf before, but he magically appeared, I mean, that was another waste of a whole sequence, Thor trying to get a hammer made (Beta Ray Bills 
hammer btw), I mean WTF, just have his proper hammer rejuvinate and hold the power, oh yeah, these writers wanted to change that part of the story as well.
These writers need to know, Stan, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko etc etc wrote and created these characters and they should stick to the original elements that made them
what they are today. They think they can come along and rewrite these stories in their vision, just like JJ Abrahams with Star Wars and Star Trek, they think they are

But little does Thermos know, the game apps feel him as a threat, once he collects all the gems, Thermos snaps his fingers and poof all the game apps Thermos doesn't like poof! Gone!

Now I've played the game apps before, and I always thought that each Avenger had their own unique powers, which after watching this, they're all pretty much equal, and in most cases its the uniform they wear that gives them the power.

","Avengers: Infinity War manages to fix and upgrade superhero movies on many levels. First, it manages to deliver a truly intimidating villain with a good motivation. Thanos, played by Josh Brolin, is an upgrade of great Marvel villains such as Killmonger, who is human, and Hela, who is a goddess. Brolin's delivery is perfect, his voice is calm but intimidating and his performance makes you actually root for him. P.s. he gets to manhandle some of the most powerful Avengers. Second, Infinity War manages to raise the stakes like never before. Even Thanos' henchmen are formidable fighters and can take on any Avenger any time. Never before have I really feared for the lives of a superhero in a superhero movie. Third, all characters have enough screen time to allow them to shine and to remind you why they are heroes. Unfortunately, Black Widow does not get much material to work with, but she has a kickass fight in the end, so I am cool. Finally, despite the destruction, the movie manages to lighten the mood periodically so it does not get too depressing. The stirring musical score by Alan Silvestri is so well integrated to the movie that manages to rouse you without you noticing it. All in all, Avengers: Infinity War is probably the only movie where you really fear for all the heroes, but somehow also root for the villain.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

188,30 April 2018,olgavalentovaov,3," Thoroughly Disappointed
","This movie has certainly made history. A film that has so much going on and still manages to be boring just has to be some sort of a record. I went to the cinema with so much hope and enthusiasm and left wishing I'd kept my cash instead. The fact that so many characters leave no room for any sort of character development probably comes as a surprise to no one, and yet every single person in the film managed to annoy me at one point or another. The only exception to that rule was Stephen Strange, whom I've come to completely adore. I've always disliked Tony Stark so I was truly sorry I didn't get to see him disappear in a cloud of poop-colored dust but at that point I was almost beyond the point of caring. Black Widow, another one of mine top runners for the character I despise the most, thankfully did not have much screen time, and yet more than most. Spider Man - more like Pathetic Spider Boy, amirite - was once more delegated to being Iron Man's most faithful groupie, and poor Bucky had maybe three minutes of screen time (after finding out that Hawkeye was not actually in the movie, he was basically the main reason why I really wanted to see this steaming pile of hot garbage, so another disappointment there).
Also, considering the number of characters who died in this, we can be almost certain that they won't stay dead, otherwise Marvel wouldn't have anybody to make movies about anymore, unless they want to bring about Squirrel Girl. So any emotional impact any deaths may have caused was non-existent. Most of the jokes fell flat, and even though the storylines were woven together almost masterfully, it did nothing to disguise the fact that this flick was basically just another pathetic cash grab. And boring to boot.
And to add insult to injury, after I sat through the entire credits, I was treated to the promise of Captain Marvel. Horay. We don't need another character up in here, we really don't. And especially not Carl Manvers.

Still being rather skeptic, the ride started, and it actually seemed promising in the beginning. As the movie proceeds, however, it felt for me like a bunch of characters fighting, in a typical ""good vs. evil"" manner, while the bad guy, who had so much more potential, seems to be utterly evil with some seemingly emotional moments of redemption mixed in. The atmosphere in the movie IS dark, much darker than the previous Marvel movies, actually. There was an ""apocalyptic"" feeling throughout the entire movie. However, I was still shocked by the public that showed many emotions during the screening. There was something I probably missed in the movie.

It is a film that is practically constant action, like many of the genre, but with a speech and an emotional weight greater than that seen on other occasions. A special care is appreciated in forming a convincing story with enough dramatic and sentimental value, at the same time that the narrative action does not stop.

","Engrossing, Epic, Emotional. Those are the three E's that define this movie. The latest instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise is at its very best, culminating ten years of marvel adventure and spectacle with the biggest and most boldest movie in the superhero genre. 
So let's start with Anthony and Joe Russo, the geniuses that made this beast of a movie. After announcing that they will be directing the next two Avengers movies, Marvel fans knew at once that this will be the darkest Avengers movie yet. Yes, it was very dark with more of a serious tone. More than Winter Soldier and Civil War (previous marvel movies directed by the Russo Bothers) combined but they also had what the other Avengers movies had as well, the humour and it was not at all tasteless. Nobody really cared if it was necessary or not because the humour worked along with the edgy parts of the movie. This is by far the Russo brothers best work among the Marvel movies completely raising the bar of superhero movies to it's highest. Praise to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for writing the amazing script (they also wrote the scripts of Captain America, The Avengers, Winter Soldier, Age of Ultron and Civil War also known to be the best marvel movies). 
Now, the characters and story. Practically everyone that you've seen in the previous marvel movies that aren't dead, are in this movie. Everyone had the chance to shine even if it's the smallest way possible. There were so many character arcs in this movie and none of them were cut short or boring. Every scene is in the movie was worth digesting and deciphering, along with the surprises and the twists and turns that will get audiences on the edge of their seat. Everything from character development to the pacing of the storyline, makes you jump, scream, gasp or cry. 
And of course, the one and only, Thanos. The villain that has been teased one too many times is finally here and he delivers. Josh Brolin officially portrays the best villain in the MCU, completely pissing on Marvel's villain problem. He brings all out on the table with everything he's got. Not only will you hate Thanos by the end of the movie, but you will understand him and maybe even feel sorry for him for a few seconds. They brought layers into him that no one has seen in a movie portrayal of a Marvel villain. They made him scary and strong at the same time vulnerable and understandable. The motivation of his doing and his character development made him the best character in the movie, making the movie all about him. 
I cannot tell you anymore about this movie because then I would be spoiling. All I have to say is that whether you're a marvel fan or not, and if you at least know what has been going on in the previous marvel movies, GO AND WATCH IT. It will not be a waste of your time or money. Digest this to prepare for what's to come. ",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

Now where do you go Disney? You gave us a worst case scenario and any future villains will be mild by comparison. As with Thor Ragnarok you destroyed a future where Marvel has skipped over many villians and leapfrogged to the top, leaving a barren wasteland for future enemies to ""marvel"" at.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018
215,5 May 2018,three_dead_crows,8," Do not believe the ratings, this movie is not nearly as good as people claim it is
","In the end this movie proved to be an absolute slugfest that never stops. The action is nonstop and there is neither any buildup or climax to the action. This could have been redeemed if the actors had any time to do their jobs but they were never given any time to perform and so the characters are rather disconnected from their surroundings and their reactions ridiculous. The only character that is given time to evolve in this movie is Thanos, and he is an interesting figure and I fully approve of how they chose to adapt his motivations instead of following the comic books. But one character is not enough and as usual there is nothing on the line which is hardly surprising since they need to milk every cent they can out of the franchise, and I do not in any way blame them for this. But when the movie ends and not a single character have been killed except for heimdal I really can't bother with their cash grabbing ways any longer. For the people who actually believes that half the characters died i pity your stupidity, because it is painfully obvious that they will be revived in the next movie and everything will continue. 
 
The day marvel decide to actually have the heroes sacrifice crap and take responsibility for their actions is the day I will respect marvel. After watching this movie I feel that the correct way to continue is to make an entire movie about what an complete and utter failure Peter Quill is, just like they did with Danny Rand in the defenders.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

Then you have that assasin girl (stupid, not even a super hero, just some average joe with moves stronger then aliens? Cmon hollywood!) Speaking of spiderboy (he doesnt deserve to be called man) He should have enough strength and then some to pull that glove off that Thanos hand easily. As i was saying too many plots to pull off. Too many unknowns left on table because of Dr. Strange. No antman was strange too...No real explanation of some things too, like the reality stone. The movie worked, but sloppily in terms of things. Without Thor this movie would have been not very good. There is a reason why Asgard was set on top of the Tree, as they are the most powerful.

246,29 April 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,9," Bold, brazen and ballsy stuff that isn't afraid to go dark; incredibly thrilling, nail-bitingly tense and satisfyingly unconventional.
","'Avengers: Infinity War (2018)' is bold, brazen, ballsy stuff that's dark, daring and manages to deftly dodge all of the deep chasms that come with having the sheer amount of characters it has, all with rich histories and personalities as different from one another as their respective films are from this. It's remarkable how well it keeps each of these in focus while also keeping them true to who we know them to be, amalgamating their presences perfectly with this new tone so that nothing is lost yet nothing stands out. Admittedly, many of even the key players don't have much to do but all of them are well drawn and exist within the world in a tangible space, fulfilling their roles in the best way they possibly can. It feels as though this is the best version of a film with over twenty core characters that could have been accomplished. Besides, it's actually Thanos that's the 'star' and that is an unconventional and unexpected move. It's also one that pays off as he is easily the best, most intimidating and most understandable villian in Marvel's history. You empathise with him, on the most human of levels at times, and can even understand his point of view, just not his methods, whilst fearing his might as it lives up to all the hype it's been given. There's a real sense of forward-momentum and a proper pacy tension propelling the picture, leading to a series of confrontations that may be almost entirely digital but feel fully palpable thanks to excellent CGI and phenomenal writing. The script sets the stakes pretty much perfectly, weaving the interpersonal character motivations with the overall universal threat, and it paints a picture of a layered, all encompassing situation in which all our players play a part. It all comes to an unexpected and deliciously downbeat close, too. This is only dampened slightly, in execution and perception, because of the flick's 'Part I' nature - as well as the announcement of a few post-'Part II' MCU titles - which is actually the source of most of the film's minor issues. Without the context of the next film, there are some elements that don't quite seem 'real', but this could just be that they haven't sunk in yet because we don't know if they will be backtracked by the sequel or if they will be solidified by it. Still, as it is, this entry in the series is perhaps the most unconventional and unexpected flick the MCU has ever produced, one that stands on its own as a ballsy blockbuster unafraid to divide its audience. The tone is almost perfect, incredibly dark but with a dash of levity where it's called for (this is how you do 'serious', DC), and the pacing is great, too, even if it feels a tad long at times due to the unusual structure. It's just a breathlessly entertaining, incredibly thrilling, nail-bitingly tense, hopelessly jaw-dropping, edge-of-your-seat roller-coaster that does all of its characters, and its legacy, justice.

","Very angry after watching this movie. It's a trend, started by Netflix, now Marvel also sees a good money making formula to force people and Marvel fans to keep watching and buying the stuff. The formula is this: make a (potential) good storyline, use good actors and great cgi but then make an open end, ready for a sequel. I'm sorry but then there is no real satisfaction after watching the movie. Normally (especially) Marvel movies end well, the good guys win, the bad guys loose. In the old days you get a good feeling and have 2 hours of good entertainment. You can replay the movie back in your head and repeat that good feeling. No not any more, all for the money, more more, make (force) the people longing for the next episode. I'm ok with that with series, but NOT for movies. Movies need to have a satisfactory good end. That is why you watch 2.5 hours of movie. It's that I could watch this for free with friends, but in a cinema I would demand my money back. What would people say if you buy a book and there is no end, you need to buy another book for the end, it's the same thing. So that is why I rate this movie a 1, even though all my favorite Marvel characters are in, lot's of humor, super CGI and everything looks great for a 10 rating, until the last few minutes. It really ruin everything before it back to the lowest rating. Oh and please, it has nothing to do with that ""I don't understand"" the movie.

","There's something odd about Infinity War and a lot of other Marvel films and it's hard to put my finger on it. But after thinking about it, here's an analogy. It's like watching a sports game where the top seeded team plays the lowest seeded team. If you're a fan of the top seeded team, then it's an amazing game. It's a very safe experience. You get to watch your team decimate their opponent. Every play is fun to watch and you leave feeling superior and satisfied. As an example I'll point out the first action sequence in Winter Soldier. Captain America jumps out of an airplane without a parachute like he's headed out to pick up the morning paper. When he lands on the ship of bad guys it looks like he's just in a casual daily sparring exercise. I felt no tension at all that he was in danger or that he couldn't take the entire ship down by himself. But here's where Marvel has it figured out. It LOOKS cool and impressive. Each kick and punch is thrown highly stylized and well choreographed. That is the problem there in general with Infinity War and others. I'd say I like about half the Marvel movies just to put that out there. To put things in contrast I'll bring up the show Agents of Shield(which sadly has been more or less cast out by Marvel). The writing on the show can be somewhat repetitive but what they do get right is the tension(and the amazing characters). Every season they put them through absolute hell over and over and over to the point where I don't know who is going to survive and even if they do, how will they recover emotionally? I'll frantically binge watch a season in like 2 weeks, staying up till 3 AM each night and then get mad at myself that I'm too tired to continue watcing. I don't feel this with the Marvel movies. But like I said before, Marvel has discovered that they don't need to make a tense storyline or deep relate-able characters. Really it's all about showcasing everyone's favorite character be dominant and show off their powers. One of the problems with Infinity War is that it felt like a sports game where they were giving out participation awards. Back in the day I was an avid comic book reader. And I knew that there was a wide range of characters with varying levels of powers. Some stronger, some medium and some without powers at all. It brought tension and interesting dynamics to the stories because why in the heck would Captain America take on Thanos head-on seriously? Cap is a smart guy. He's not that stupid. As far as super abilities Cap is on the lesser end. Similar to Batman in many ways. He uses his intelligence, speed and fighting ability most of all. But he knew his limitations and his comic book had a raw relate-ability that other comics didn't. The fact that Cap actually beat the crap out of Iron Man in Civil War is absolutely preposterous. So there were many moments in Infinity War where super heroes were treated on equal levels when they shouldn't have been. I have some other criticisms of the movie like how all minor villains were completely forgettable. I don't know their names or really much anything about them. And Black Widow continues to annoy me with her invincibility and the fact that she is so American it's cringe worthy. And Thanos' supposed sacrifice of Gomorrah and his inner pain that was trying to pull on my heart strings? Yeah not very believable. The movie wasn't terrible... just to clarify. But the main thing I wanted to point out is that many people are saying this is a great movie and well that's your opinion but maybe it's just a great looking movie and you enjoy it because you get to see your favorite heroes kick butt. But does that make it a good movie though? You could argue that it did have tension because at the end half of the characters die. By the time all that started happening I already knew that Marvel doesn't have the guts to kill of anyone major.

The backstory of Thanos and his daughter was too brief and insufficient to provide a more complex and bonded emotional connection is one problem. And another problem is simply too many superheroes that almost makes the movie more about heroes becoming the norm instead of super.

This movie could've been three hours plus, but putting it all together in two hours thirty minutes is a real achievement. I was never bored too; there was action right in the beginning to the end. I know a lot of the non-comic moviegoers are going to hate this movie, because they had no idea that Thanos would kill everyone, luckily I knew what was going to happen. I think it was a hard decision for Marvel to take this direction; due to the criticism of the naive moviegoers, salute to Marvel. The thing is, if Marvel never explained all of the characters, then this could've ended up as a failure. We knew all of the characters and plots.

","Overkill on so many levels.Too many characters, too many worlds, too many explosions.

Also too many times, before he had the full set of rings that Thanos could have been shot but no, everyone politely waited until he was aware of their presence (eg when he is talking to Gomorra and Star Lord is standing there with a loaded gun doing nothing!!!). I cried at the end of GOTG 2 when Yondu died, but this movie almost trivialised death, it was an emotionally vacant experience. I love both Marvel and DC universes but this missed in too many ways to be engaging, Justice League a clear winner. a final thought, the music was also draggy which didn't help, I came out thinking I may well see the follow up on DVD. My favourite bits were the different groups meeting each other and finding out that Thor speaks Groot. My advice to Marvel studios, you seem to focus on Iron Man a lot, he is an unlikeable character, choose someone else as your lead and maybe that would help audience engagement, certainly would mine.

","Well, this movie is certainly entertaining and packed with action and expensive visual effects. It also gathers superheroes from several comics in one place. This feels both fresh and random. It also feels like each character is less interesting, because the writers had to write for so many characters, and they had to spread their effort instead of focusing it. The only actually funny characters here are the guardians of the galaxy, and they are still pretty shallow. The villain team looks like some orcish/undead characters straight from some fantasy video game. The ending might seem like a fresh move for some people, but to me it was just very underwhelming. Not unexpected, no twist, just ""to be continued"", and also on the verge of justifying genocide. This already makes the movie not really worth watching. You get entertained, but it's shallow and empty. And besides that, there are lots of logical inconsistencies. And the biggest one is why would they even fight throughout the whole film? The outcome of their fight is completely inconsistent with their effort. Then, why does the main villain use his powers in some cases and instantly undoes everything that the good guys try to do upon him, but in other cases he just wrestles with them as if he has no superpower at all? And gets no damage most of the time, except one moment where he gets a tiny scar. This really lowers the stakes.

","Avengers: Infinity War is a spectacle to behold to the general audience. To the avid Marvel Studios fan, however, it is the epitome of movie going. It spends next to no time explaining the close relationships some characters share, and instead, builds the most memorable villain since Heath Ledger's Joker.

","Though surprisingly rich, the film's storyline remains incomplete. Feels more like several movies squished together. ""Avengers: Infinity War"" isn't a perfect film, but it's probably exactly what it wants to be. A massive spectacle full of fun character moments and impressive action sequences. It is an entertaining movie but one that leaves too many unanswered questions. Also it is too long, too dark and too confusing but the humor and all star cast helps you endure the overrunning length. On the whole, ""Infinity War"" is what fans have been clamoring for - an action movie that puts everyone under one cinematic roof, that puts all the good guys against the ultimate big bad for a better universe.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","""Avengers: Infinity War"" is a bit of an animal, packed with action, good storyline, a good smattering of humour and really good special effects. The film is packed with many hero characters, that sometimes makes the viewer struggle to work out how they all fit into the script. You have to have watched the previous Marvel movies, in sequence, to recall each characters role and ""powers"". This is a long movie, but it is an action rollercoaster. I have to say that the ending is in true Marvel movies tradition; it is like wadding through extra thick treacle, it is that slow and drawn out. But, it is clever in that it keeps the view hooked and on the edge. It seems like this is it, game over, but we shall see. As I said, this is a really good movie, perhaps the best from Marvel Movies in my opinion, I really enjoyed it. The special effects are just superb, the storyline is full of twists and turns, and all the different actors brought together works in perfect motion.

367,5 May 2018,ironhorse_iv,9," Avengers: Infinity War is a Comic Book Triumph. Everything nearly assembled flawlessly.
","Ever since Walt Disney Company purchase Marvel Studios in 2009; they have been on a blockbuster roll, with their comic book movies. Their Cinematic Universe lead by producer, Kevin Feige has introduces countless amounts of superheroes and their stories to vary amounts of success. In return, every standalone & 'Avengers' assemble movie, the studio had made, has been built up to lead up to an all-encompassing climatic arch, in which big villain, Thanos (Motion Capture & Voice Acting by Josh Brolin) will one day, come to control the universe, through the use of six powerful infinity stones. Most of those films in their Phrase One & Two, kinda work, as they help push the apocalypse doom subplot, in a somewhat foreshadowing constant rate. However somewhere, in Marvel Studios Phrase 3 film campaign, that story thread began to lose some ground, as more popular & recent Marvel Comic story elements were put in the foreground like 'Civil War' & 'World War Hulk'. Because of that, it really felt, like Thanos threats of worlds domination storyline was not only coming at snail pace, but simply, delay, more and more, in order to milk more cash out of establish standalone films. Not only, was this decision, causing, doubt that this assemble movie would ever get release, but it was also, making people, wonder, if the film can be possible to be made. Finally, in 2017, we got our answer, as one of the biggest & the most ambitious film projects ever undertaken start to take shape with screenwriter, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and directors, Anthony & Joe Russo with their crew on hand, shooting back to back with a direct sequel. In 2018, on the ten year anniversary of the Studios first cinematic universe movie 2008's 'Iron Man', 'Avenger: Infinity War' was finally released to the public. Without spoiling the 19th overall film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, too much, it did live up to the hype as one of the best entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe yet. It was somewhat accurate to the first half of the 'Infinity Gauntlet' comic book story, written by Jim Starlin, minus the absence of some key characters, like Adam Warlock, Silver Surfer and Mistress Death. Hopefully, they are in 2019 sequel. As for length. For 3 hour film, it was also surprisingly, well-paced. However, there were some really confusing exposition dump parts in the film that seem really odd. It seem like the movie cut a lot of sequences. One of them, involving the Nova Corp & the Power Stone, and the other, concerning the Soul Stone & Thanos's daughters. This also, includes the after credit ending, with the hints to Captain Marvel. Those parts really did seem like to come out of left field. Despite that, while, the movie does jump around, a lot; every scene was a very heart pounding experience built on many amazing heroic characters having to deal with such devastating stakes, in their own unique ways. Surprisingly, the movie gave, enough screen time to, nearly all the marvel characters, without, turning into a giant mess of a film. It's also truly unique, in how well, the writers, fully introduced the villain with all the heroic characters, having to deal with him, one way or another. The screenwriters really did flesh out, Thanos from a cartoony over the top, out there simpleton baddie, into a believable down to earth, well verse, complex nemesis through his fatherhood subplot. Not only that, but Brolin's acting is so commanding, that he really seem like a serious threat with his voice. It was a huge improvement, since his last appearance. He's the best Marvel villain, yet. Even as a special effect character, Thanos kinda moves as if he's really there. The only scene, that kinda look fake with him, was, in the beginning, when he was choking out, a character. As for the good guys, the CGI suits on Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) & Spiderman (Tom Holland) could had look a little more realistic. It was given off, a 2011's 'Green Lantern' vibe. Other than that, all the action scenes with them, and the other CGI characters such as Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Groot (Voiced by Vin Diesel) & Rocket (Voiced by Bradley Cooper) were compelling enough to overlook the CGI spot fest. As for full make up performers like Dave Bautista (Drax), Karen Gillian (Nebula) and Zoe Saldana (Gamora). They did well in their scenes. As for Paul Bettany's acting was alright as Vision, but his makeup, was still a bit off. As for live action performers such as Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) & Starlord (Chris Pratt) and others. Every performer in this movie did a great job in their action scene & their acting. Even, the Stan Lee & Peter Dinklage cameo was great. I have no complains about that. As for the humor, it was fine. Lots of laugh out loud moments for a surprisingly dark film. As for the depressing bittersweet ending. I love it! While, a lot of diehard fans and young children might find, this climax to be upsetting. Just note, to take it, with a grain of salt. It's a comic book movie. There is always, going to be some kind of McGuffin or Ex Machina to bring them back. I just glad, Disney took the risk, rarely than play it safe. It was broad to subvert expectations. Overall: The movie was an exceptional achievement that somehow leaves you both fully satisfied and desperate for more. In the end, 'Avengers: Infinity War' ranks among the best adventures, we've seen yet from this stellar franchise. I can't wait for the next movie. I highly recommended seeing this.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

369,21 February 2019,Emma-M-V,5," Just not that enjoyable
","There are obviously good things about this movie - a lot of talented people worked on it and especially in the scene design there is a lot to like. But there are a lot of problems too.
For one it feels disjointed, as if there are scenes that have been uncomfortably cut out. Only a few characters get introduced, and just a few more get what feels like a decent amount of screentime and dialogue. With Cap for example, his role feels extremely insignificant - as if he as a character could have been replaced with any other Avenger performing the same actions and nothing would change.
I thought Vision's and the Witch's romance was pretty inoffensive and sweet. I was surprised at how much of a role they had, but the actors did very well at making me see them as real characters, which was at times difficult with some of the more main-cast characters.
On the other hand Tony gets an uninteresting and cheesy as hell intro that easily could have been pared down, he and Strange have a stupidly prolonged dickwagging segment and Banner's way to frequent attempts at humor made me wish somebody would shoot him in the face already.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","I was there ten years ago when Iron Man graced our screens. I was too ignorant to see the movie in the cinema but I was there the second the film came out on DVD. One of my all time favourite cinematic memories was seeing The Avengers in 2012 with all of my friends, after Iron Man came out we saw every film leading up to the Avengers in the cinema and stuck around for each post credit scene. Here I am six years after The Avengers, Infinity War tickets go on sale and I buy two for the BFI IMAX in Waterloo for me and my girlfriend. I walked into this movie with nothing but high expectations and they were all met. This film benefits from the existence of the other 18 films in this illustrious franchise. It builds upon every single character thread and arc laid down in previous films. No theme is left untouched and no character is left without their traits and quirks. Time has left it's toll on some and has barely graced others. Iron Man's unwillingness to let go of the life he stepped into 10 years ago shows in his absolute eagerness to step into battle with his new nano-suit. Captain America's optimism has wavered but his ability to fight for what is right hasn't. The romance between Wanda and Vision doesn't feel random or forced because their connection has been present since Age of Ultron and especially Civil War.

379,1 May 2018,CardinalsBaseball,2," Grade - Incomplete
","This is an incomplete film. Thanos is collecting the 6 gem stones, which can magically do anything for the possessor. The Avengers, Guardians and anyone else you can think of are out to stop him. That is the entire crux of the film.
 Thanos' motivation is that he wants to eliminate half of the universe's population under the notion that it will somehow cure poverty and starvation. This premise is asinine, however. Earth was half of it's current population a mere 50 years ago, and poverty and starvation was an even bigger problem at the time, than it is today. If he really was concerned with the ratio between life and natural resources, why not increase the amount of resources? Either way you look at it, the motivation was incredibly asinine and poorly thought out. Regardless, that's Thanos' master plan and the heroes aim to stop him. From the very beginning, however, they fail miserably. By movie's end, Thanos has won; he has all of the gems and half of the universe is dead, including all of Asgard and at least half of our heroes. The End. Seriously, that's the end. 
 Now most folks recognize that the carnage and death in this film will be undone in the next movie. Dr. Strange likely cast a spell on his gem that will start mucking about with time and reality and they will somehow make things right again in time for those Black Panther and Guardians of the Galaxy sequels. But that's a completely different film and that just belies the significance of this film even further, Films should stand on their own. Infinity War doesn't do that. If you get off seeing the heroes getting their asses kicked and dying while the bad guy wins at the end; then this is the film for you. I think that's the sort of story that would only appeal to someone who enjoys tearing the wings off flies.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

381,10 August 2018,fmbr-1,4," Deeply flawed
","There are two types of stories where the hero doesn't save the day. Horror and documentary - horror because the villian is far too powerful to begin with, but even then is usually thwarted by the last of the survivors it has chosen to torment. The other is documentaries, because they are based on real events - but usually the heroes win, because they write the histories.
This film is neither and while others applaud the boldness of letting half of the universe get snuffed out, I would say that if the studio was truly bold it would not release another film featuring the characters it so casually got rid of. As it is, this 'boldness' costs them nothing more than thinking of some BS excuse to bring them back, and we are all the poorer for it, for if they can be brought back once, why not twice? Why not over and over again? Death has no meaning to these heroes, they'll be back as long as writers can dream up an excuse.
Further, I object to Thanos' loony idea. Kill five billion people on Earth (half is less but then there are airline pilots that disappeared, people killed in traffic because of crashes, etc. etc. Within 100 years, the population will be pushing 8 billion again. He hasn't stoped the problem, merely delayed it for a little while.
However, the problem isn't even real. Thomas Malthus published his 'Essay on the Principle of Population' in 1798 predicting that people would run out of food - yet today, we produce far more food than we can use (even if it was sent to feed the hungry in areas of famine).
Finally, Thanos doesn't even have the courage of his convictions. If he believed that it was for the good of the universe, he should have volunteered that he be the first taken. The fact that he isn't means that he doesn't believe and is also a coward.
Truly this is the worst of the Marvel films to date.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

There is no real drama at the end because like any comic book...the character's will return. However - the fights are great fun. So - like any great crossover...it was big and loud but not as good as a single edition adventure.,/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

Josh Brolin deserved at least a nomination, if not the statue itself. This movie was about Thanos, and Brolin brought the character to life, showing that he was a man, but had a vision that would not be denied. The CGI was just adequate to keep up; it was the actor that made the character real. I was almost rooting for Thanos by the end. Almost.

","Here's my review of AVENGERS INFINITY WAR. That's right I had to type that title in caps cause that's how big this movie is. It's a Visual 'Marvel'. Get it ? Visual ""Marvel"". That's a bad attempt at humor.sorry. Moving on , iw is directed by the Russo brothers and stars almost everyone ?!. Now the story has a lot of arcs to it but is centralized to one Thanos. I loved how they set up character introductions along the way and made sure there was no phasing issues which is really important in a movie close to 3 hours. This movie is a really dark one but the one liners and humour are spot on and are never forced anywhere unlike justice league *cough* *cough*. I also loved how they took time to explore other worlds in the movie while there was so much going on , there is a lot going on in this movie , like a lot ! . But just like any other movie on the hype train it does have it's flaws. Remember how I said there were many arcs , sometimes the switch from one arc to another takes a really long time . Other than that , ok what else ? . The CGI in this movie is amazing but personally I thought they could've done better with iron man's armor. And even the little details on Josh brolins face were really good. And when you finally feel like these arcs are gonna combine and all for something bigger , then BOOM ! A cliffhanger right there.And it's an ending I'm still trying to figure out. In the end , avengers infinity war is something which travels beyond expectation , with great characters , a gripping story , great visuals and a cliffhanger ending for the avengers to actually ""assemble"" in the next movie (hopefully) .",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

524,29 April 2018,Thekeybaldemasterrises,10," This movie is an experience. A true blockbuster achievement. Spoiler review.
","""There was an idea. To bring together a group of remarkable people. To see if they could become something more. So when we needed them. They could fight the battles that we never could."" It's opened everyone. 10 years worth of storytelling, world building, character development, it's all led to this. One last warning this is the SPOILER review. Don't read anymore if you haven't seen it!! To spoil it is to take away the experience. This truly is a cinematic achievement. Nothing has ever reached to this scale before. It's the ultimate pay off. So the biggest question is, was it worth the wait? YES. Yes it was. I'm honestly floored by this film. It's so much better than it has any right to be. By god though did Marvel do it. They actually did it. This is the most ambitious movie they've made yet, and I really enjoyed myself. It's like they've taken all of our criticisms of the previous films and gave it their all with this one. They did not hold back. It actually shocks me that Disney even let them make this movie because there is so much devastation and heartbreak that happens, but I'm proud of them for trusting Marvel to make this. I can't imagine how they had to sell the deaths of characters like Groot or Spider-Man like can you imagine asking the Disney execs to sign off on that? So you can only imagine what my reaction was to all of this. I laughed, I cheered, and I cried. I cried! Let me just start off though that I am completely aware this movie is not perfect, not even the Empire Strikes Back is, but that doesn't mean it overshadows the rest of it all. Let me start off with what didn't work for me. I didn't like how the Black Order was handled. They were intimidating but we didn't know much about them. The most we get about them is that they're the loyal children of Thanos? Ebony Maw or Squidward as Tony calls him, was probably the most memorable one because we got his name and they slowed down to focus on his dialogue. The other ones like Proxima Midnight? I think that's the only other name I heard. They just seemed like meaningless obstacles that had little development. They work fine as henchmen, but nothing more. What else did I not like? Nothing. I loved everything else. I'm trying to hear out everyone's issues with this movie and the only one I can maybe agree with is the ending feels cheap because we know it's only part 1 of 2 movies. So all the characters who vanished we know are coming back. That's not the point to me though. The point is that Marvel understands they've been criticized for not taking chances, that they play things too safe and that there are never consequences in their movies. So they had the guts to kill off nearly half of our beloved heroes in front of our very eyes. Now I don't know about you, but I lost it. Watching Groot vanish while Rocket wept. Watching Spider-Man tremble into Tony's arms begging for his life, was just soul shattering to watch on screen. I cried a lot during this movie. I cried for Loki, Gamora's entire story, Tony's fakeout death, when Spider-Man started to vanish, and even when Cap did everything he could to hold back Thanos. The biggest thing I appreciate about this film is how it just doesn't ever slow down. The pace is excellent. People might see this as a negative but I think this is a good thing because when you have this massive event with this many characters you just have to keep it moving. There's always something happening on screen whether if it's character banter, developing Thanos, or just insane action. I was never bored and I was just really engaged from beginning to end. The tones all blend really well too. It's funny when it needs to be, but it's not afraid to punch you in the gut and make you choke up like ""did that really just happen?"" Marvel actually had stakes and tension throughout the entire thing and I was so nervous waiting for each scene to play out. By the time credits rolled I was so traumatized I felt like I needed therapy LOL. Each character reacts the way they usually would and I'd totally debate people on that. The Russo Brothers clearly talked to all the other Marvel filmmakers and give each character at least one thing to do. That's all you can really wish for, the fact that they even had this many characters in the film and still made it work is nothing short of a miracle, because it could've been a complete disaster. Let me talk the biggest force of this movie though. The villain. Is Thanos a good villain after all this time? I would argue he's even better than I thought he would be. I think his plan is very profound for a guy who literally wants to wipe out half the universe. He wants balance in a world(universe) where people constantly struggle and suffer from just life. That he feels he's doing everyone a favor. These are what the good villains do. They don't wake up in the morning and think IM GONNA BE BAD TODAY. I still can't believe it's Josh Brolin because the cgi looked so good on him. He's definitely a highlight of the movie without a doubt. I guess it's time to predict what happens next, so we know now that Thanos has achieved his goal. People are vanishing left and right while he sits peacefully as he said he would. However we all know if people just vanished, there's a high probability they'll come back. The one thing I noticed is the ones who mostly made it are the original Avengers team minus War Machine, Rocket, Nebula, and Okoye. I wonder if there's some sort of significance to this as why the original Avengers survive and the newer ones and most of the Guardians did not. Of course the answer lies with Dr. Strange looking into the future and acknowledging there being only one possible outcome where they win out of millions(billions?) of outcomes. And we know that prior to that moment Strange made it clear that if it came to Tony or Spider-Man's life over the stone that he would not hesitate to let them die. However he gives up the stone to save Tony. So he knows Tony is a key for this outcome and that he must survive. Also Captain Marvel must play some large role in all of this henceforth the post credits scene. There's a lot of anticipation for Avengers 4. Like what it will be called. How is everyone saved, and more importantly will Thanos help to reverse it all or will he fall into madness till the Avengers overpower him? There's a lot to look forward to and I sure hope Avengers 4 can have the same level of impact this movie did because Infinity War knocked out of the park for me. This movie is an experience and that's why I can give it the highest honor of a 10/10. Now does this mean it's a perfect film? No, not on my scale. A 10/10 simply means this movie met and exceeded all my expectations. It engaged me from beginning to end. It got me to feel so many different emotions. I'm proud of Marvel for bringing us 10 years worth of stories and more to come. Go see it In IMAX if you can, it was phenomenal.

Few supervillains share Thanos' warped point of view as well as his staggering supremacy. After several cameos in earlier Marvel epics, the long-awaited Thanos devastates everybody and everything in his path like an apocalypse. Just about every Marvel superhero shows up to hamper this doomsday juggernaut from looting the universe for those six ultra-powerful Infinity Stones that auger ill for the future. ""Captain America: Winter Soldier"" and ""Captain America: Civil War"" co-directors Joe and Anthony Russo and ""Captain America"" co-writers Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus have delivered a sequel that indisputably surpasses its predecessors, but it is debatable that Marvel can elevate the stakes much higher in later sequels for a villain as formidable as Thanos. Moreover, the greatest criticism many may raise is that their favorite Marvel superhero may have been short changed in this saga owing to a lack of time to streamline everybody into the storyline.

Second, they have introduced so many new (and funny) characters to the MCU that this edition was infused with some fresh energy and laughter. Buuuut...there were still too many characters. A movie like this cannot reach the heights of Homecoming, Ragnorok, or Black Panther. Less is more.

 Though I have been pleased enough to see Marvel revitalized with the films of the last almost 20 years, to me, and no doubt countless die hard comic fans out there, the Marvel Cinematic Universe falls short of greatness, occupying a slot just below the somewhat lackluster Ultimate line of Marvel titles.
 A never impressive Hulk, a sickening to behold Thor, a HUGE lack of characters that are mainstays of Marvel comics, but have, like with the trend in comics themselves, been retconned out of films, the avengers series are okay at first, but lose value after rewatching but a few times.

Reaching places visually and emotionally that this MCU franchise finally needed to take. Carried by a fabulous performance by Josh Brolin as Thanos, he makes this movie his own, as the Avengers are just there to do their best. But is their best enough. Such an epic experience.

","It's like Transformers, but with a story intact! All the Transformers movies were epic to me, but as the sequels came, the stories got more and more lost. Not Avengers: Infinity War. As an ex-comic collector (over 15 years), I was quite well acquainted with Thanos. My biggest worry was how they were going to pull off a weird looking hulk of an alien like him and not make him look like a doofus. Pulled off they did. Thanos was convincing and menacing, but most importantly he felt ""real"". Of course, no one can fault the fantastic, solid cast in the Avengers - Captain America, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Scarlet Witch, Dr Strange, etc. (though I missed Hawkeye) were all rock-solid and it's amazing how their characters shined through despite the very very full cast of the Marvel Universe. The action was epic - this is where it reminds me of Transformers - where the CGI was fantastic, blended well, etc. The difference? Infinity War had a rock-solid story that tied in all the characters really well, and it had a whole raft of emotions - funny, sad, poignant, shocking, surprising, mindblowing moments all came through the movie.

677,27 May 2018,hannahgrahambell,5," Works only in the context of the Marvel Cinematic Universe
","Taken in the context of a larger narrative within the Marvel cinematic universe, Avengers: Infinity War impressively brings together the many beloved characters together for an action-packed adventure. However, the movie does not work on its own as a narrative, and like most Marvel movies it has particular cinematic flaws.
From the first scene, it is clear that Infinity War relies heavily on CGI for both its characters and action sequences, which should not come to a surprise for Marvel fans. In fact, it is plausible to say that more than half the movie is touched by CGI, from epic space sets to flashy bursts of light denoting magical power. The CGI isn't done badly, but for anyone who isn't on completely board with that style of animation, Infinity War would be unwatchable. At times, the amount of mystical sparks, auras, and beams becomes so saturated that it is difficult to take the movie seriously. 
Luckily, Infinity War has some of the world's most beloved actors and characters in its arsenal, which have proven to be Marvel's greatest strength as a franchise. Having Robert Downey Jr. as Ironman, Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Strange, Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther, and Chris Pratt as Starlord, just to name a few, give their characters credibility and charm. The writers do an excellent job balancing the many heroes, whose individual movies are often tonally different. Since the audience presumably has come to know and love each character from the standalone films and/or the Avengers, the actors are able to slip into their respective roles easily. This gives Infinity War a feeling of akin to huge family reunion, which definitely works in the movie's favor because the audience is emotionally invested.
What makes the movie unique is that instead of following the traditional three act structure, the entire two hour and forty minute film acts as only as a chapter in a larger Avengers movie. Infinity War could be described as the latter half of a second act and the beginning of the third act. This means that the movie is almost entirely action with little exposition or character development. The lack of elaborate backstory or convoluted plot is refreshing in some ways, as some of the other Marvel movies suffer from over-complication. The action is well-choreographed and relatively creative, but because it fills the entire movie it can be mind-numbing. Anyone not familiar with Marvel or critical of the franchise will find nothing to connect to. Unfortunately, Infinity War lacks the political complexity and mysterious suspense presented in previous films. Shades of gray on moral dilemmas and conflicts between the heroes are downplayed or ignored in favor of a clear good vs. evil battle. 
Infinity War is a success within the world of Marvel, but not as a movie in its own right. Fortunately for Disney, Marvel is wildly popular among critics and fans alike, making it a financial and critical success. All of the advantages and disadvantages of a cinematic universe are shown in this movie, making it a unique cultural phenomenon.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

Thanos strength was very inconsistent after an opening scene where he kills Loki and make light work of the hulk without the infinity stones he then struggle to beat iron man and even captain America lived after an encounter with him when he had most of the infinity stones.
Also thanos goones came for vision who at the time was with scarlet witch. Both from previous movies are powerful characters but thanos goones makes light weight of them and if it wasn't for captain America black widow and falcon who all are human possessing no actual power but they were able to beat the goones it was really mind numbing.

712,3 May 2018,jadediamond,6," Adios Marvel Universe!
","After being on Marvel train since 2008, I am finally hopping off because I am burnt out on their formulaic superhero movie plot. Black Panther was the best Marvel movie to date because it took a chance and stepped out of the traditional superhero movie format and told a compelling, yet relevant story with a great hero and a well-rounded villain in Killmonger. Its weakest moments occurred when it had to conform to the Marvel formula. Thor: Ragnarok was also a great movie because it stopped taking itself too seriously and was fun and refreshing. Yet, this movie rubbed me the wrong way. Don't get me wrong. It's a good movie because Marvel played it safe again with its formula. Thanos was a great villain and this was really his movie. The Russo brothers already showed their greatness when reinventing Captain America with the excellent sequels Captain America: Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War, which was the real Avenger 3 and way better than this movie. I can tell from this movie like with Joss Whedon's Avengers 2, the brothers creativity was stifled by studio heads thinking more about milking the movie for as much of the billions its worth and will make regardless instead of creating a great movie audience can enjoy. 
I have four main annoyances with this movie. The First Annoyance: Infinity War was advertised as not being split into two movies anymore and it was only going to be one movie. Which is why the ending was confusing along with the post credits because the studio did not inform the public it was going to be split into two movies leaving the audience scratching their heads after expecting a complete movie. The remaining audience members who stayed behind to watch the post credits laughed at Samuel L. Jackson famously about to curse being as confused as we were about the ending. As we exited the theater, one brave audience member bravely asked out loud if anyone got the ending. Everyone burst into laughter because none of us did. The Second annoyance: There was no need to have a second movie. Just like Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part One and Two, this movie could have been completed in one movie. There is no need for a second movie because thirty minutes more and the already long movie could have ended in one satisfying movie. The ending is like watching the final act of a movie and then the film abruptly ending right before the final scene. It was a cheap shot from the executives to get more money out of the pubic and introduce new Marvel superheroes when the movie was already oversaturated with unnecessary superheroes who only spoke a few lines to say, ""Hey, I'm in the movie."" The only relevant characters in this movie are Thanos, Gamora, Dr. Strange, Tony Stark, Thor, and maybe Vision because he is an Infinity Stone carrier. The rest was completely unnecessary filler. The Third Annoyance: Defying the laws of Physics. I am no genius but if Thanos if stronger than Hulk and Thor, then how can Iron Man and Captain America survive a punch from him? Shouldn't they both be dead? Oh and speaking of death. My Final Annoyance: The Deaths. It's quite obvious who's coming back for sequels to their own individual movie franchises and who didn't renew their contracts? Why make the ones you know are coming back for sequels disappear and then keep the ones who didn't renew their contracts? It's like they are afraid to kill off Tony Stark and Captain America. Robert Downey Jr. is in his fifties now, and Chris Evans is tired of the superhero gig just like Hugh Jackman was of playing Wolverine for seventeen years. Give them a noble death and passed on the torch to the next generation. Yet, both characters survived moments that should have killed them. Another complaint was that the deaths in this movie had no emotional meaning or impact. You know it's a superhero movie and if characters are popular enough, the studio heads will bring them back from the dead in the sequel or starring in a TV show. So moments when you should mourn the lost of a character, you feel nothing when that character is killed off. Which made the ending more bizarre on the studio's part. Diehard Marvel fans are going to say it's the greatest movie because they have been conditioned to love Marvel and go to every Marvel movie, even waiting during the five minutes of credits to see two extra scenes. Yet, for someone who is burnt out on seeing grown men running around in their underwear fighting each other, I'm hopping off the train. Black Panther and Thor: Ragnarok were both great movies, yet, I don't appreciate the stunt the movie executives pulled, and I feel like I wasted two and half hours of my life. I finally understood the ending, but it still could have been wrapped up in one movie. So if you love Marvel, go watch the movie. If you're a casual fan, wait until part two comes out and watch this movie right before you go see part two.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018
713,25 April 2018,alva3901,10," Infinity War is brave, brilliant and spectacular
","Infinity War is the pinnacle of what blockbuster films should be. Directed by the Russo brothers, they manage to achieve the almost impossible feat of culminating all the characters and their stories into one epic film. The action, the characters, the story and the overall experience is spectacular to behold. Each characters has their own moment to shine, as we see new fun and somewhat emotional interactions between characters and story arcs that pay off as the film progresses . The result is a film that often feels surprisingly earnest and emotional. It pays off our emotional investment into these great characters over each of the 18 previous films through a great culmination of storytelling. The humor we have come to expect in Marvel films is lively and full of banter, particularly between Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and the quick-fire interplay between Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and the Guardians of the Galaxy. Unlike Marvel's cascade of villains who are turned secondary to their superhero counterparts, Thanos (Josh Brolin) is the central character in this epic, with a moral compass that is beyond what many might expect. Whilst he may seem to be the most demonic villain that the Avengers have come across, he is by far and away the most complex of them all, testament to the directing and writing of the film. There's a lot going on in this movie, with many scenes occurring almost simultaneously, leaving the ending on a much vague yet appropriate cliffhanger. Overall, Infinity War epitomizes the perfect blockbuster film that ends in poetic grace and is sure to leave you questioning what will happen next.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018
714,18 May 2018,jami-imaj,5," I was Bored
","My wife usually sleeps through movies at the theater, sort of my own geiger counter for boring with snores instead of clicks. More popcorn for me so I'm ok with it but this movie had so many long drawn out parts that I was bored. I guess part of the problem is so many stars in each scene, they all need screen time, all need important lines, so if something is going on like say ... trying to take a glove off Thanos there's a bunch of characters who've been in other movies that have endeared them to audiences that the scene takes a very long time. Most people liked mantis, and the new spiderman is perfect, ironman is awesome as always ... the list goes on. It took them ten minutes trying to take the dudes glove off !! Who takes ten minutes to take a glove off ??! I mean yes before Going to the movie one of us took about ten minutes trying on different shoes but Come On it's a Glove !! And the dude's almost asleep strap a rocket to it (you did this to gamora) push a button and it comes off. So much of this movie was like that, long drawn out scenes of looking ... thinking ... brooding ... they could have taken an hour off this movie and not lost any content. And speaking of lack of content, there was almost no hulk in this, he was in it for what, a minute? I think it was about one minute, yes I like ruffalo but when I was a kid I didn't watch the show for bixby, it was to see ferrigno. The only redeeming quality, my favorite part was Peter Dinklage. My second favorite character in the game of thrones world and they made him a Giant. Awesome. I might rent this, only because I can fast forward a lot of this but I will not buy it, and I have a bunch of marvel movies on my shelf.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

Yes, I know the comic book lore of the Avengers team and Thanos and the Soul Gems, it's just that the movie falls under its own weight of too many superheroes with too many subplots. Each character's presence is diluted because of the need to give fair screen time to each. Spider-Man, Bruce Banner, Black Widow, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, each Guardian of the Galaxy. And I don't know if it was just me, but the actors kinda seemed to phone it in for the most part. Of course, this isn't Tolstoy, it's a bunch of people with mutant or augmented superpowers traveling through space-time to stop an intergalactic warlord from retrieving gems that will give him the ability to rebalance the universe. There's a lot of contemporary humor in the movie, namely the millennial snark found in modern sitcoms. I don't get the hype, but I do appreciate that some people will like this.

The second the guardians met Thor the movie fully halted and I became very bored. The entire time I was wondering about the more interesting plot of spider man, Dr strange and Iron Man but that was put to the side for countless jokes that missed and only a few that I actually found funny. After this though the film did pick up a lot of pace allowing this review to not be negative, I really enjoyed the breathtaking fight scene on Wakanda. Finally the ending of this film was such a cop-out, there is next to no chance that the characters taken away will not come back within the next movie.

Thanos was amazing but some deaths were unnecessary and useless in the ending like Spider-Man and Black Panther, if you asked me they should have taken out the main avengers which would have been pretty dope. Overall movie was enjoyable, still don't know if it would be the best Avengers movie compared to Avengers 1. But I think infinity war takes the lead because of Thanos and the the direction. Well done for the Russo brothers. 
Badass characters like Thor who came at the ending with his new weapon and just destroyed Thanos's army. It changed the movie. I would have given it a 10 if the ending could have been better.

","The Marvel Cinematic Universe movie series has been fantastic, many fans including me were happy to see it celebrating its tenth anniversary, this next instalment in the Avengers series, bringing together over twenty Marvel superheroes, was the most ambitious and high anticipation, directed by the Russo brothers (Welcome to Collinwood, You, Me and Dupree, Captain America: The Winter Soldier & Civil War). Basically, Thanos (Josh Brolin) and his lieutenants - Proxima Midnight (Carrie Coon), Ebony Maw (Tom Vaughan-Lawlor), Corvus Glaive (Michael James Shaw) and Cull Obsidian (Terry Notary) - have acquired the Power Stone. They intercept the ship carrying the survivors of Asgard's destruction, they extract the Space Stone from the Tesseract. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is subdued and Thanos kills Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and overpowers Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Heimdall (Idris Elba) transports Hulk to Earth before being killed, then Thanos and his lieutenants leave and the ship is destroyed. Hulk crash-lands at the Sanctum Sanctorum in New York City, reverting to Bruce Banner, there he meets Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Wong (Benedict Wong) and warns them of Thanos' plan to kill half of all life in the universe, so Strange recruits Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.). Maw and Obsidian arrive to retrieve the Time Stone from Strange, drawing the attention of Peter Parker aka Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Maw fails to take the Time Stone due to an enchantment, but captures Strange. Stark and Parker pursue Maw's spaceship, while Banner contacts Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans), and Wong stays behind to guard the Sanctum. In Scotland, Midnight and Glaive ambush Wanda Maximoff aka Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) in order to retrieve the Mind Stone in Vision's forehead. Rogers, Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Sam Wilson aka Falcon (Anthony Mackie) rescue them and shelter with James Rhodes aka War Machine (Don Cheadle) at the Avengers Compound. Vision offers to sacrifice himself, to have the Mind Stone destroyed to keep Thanos from retrieving it, Rogers suggests they travel to Wakanda, which may have the resources to remove the stone without destroying Vision. The Guardians of the Galaxy respond to a distress call from the Asgardian ship and rescue Thor, he surmises Thanos seeks the Reality Stone, which is in the possession of the Collector (Benicio Del Toro) on Knowhere. Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Groot (Vin Diesel) accompany Thor to Nidavellir, Thor is also given a new eye, on the now deserted planet they and Eitri, King of the Dwarves (Peter Dinklage), create an enchanted battle-axe called Stormbreaker capable of killing Thanos. On Knowhere, Peter Quill aka Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoë Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista) and Mantis (Pom Klementieff) find Thanos who has already got the Reality Stone in his possession. Thanos kidnaps Gamora, his adoptive daughter, she is forced to reveal the location of the Soul Stone as her captive adoptive sister Nebula (Doctor Who's Karen Gillan) is being tortured. Thanos and Gamora travel to Vormir, where Red Skull (Ross Marquand), keeper of the Soul Stone, informs him the stone can only be retrieved by sacrificing someone he loves, Thanos reluctantly throws Gamora off a cliff, granting him the Soul Stone. Nebula escapes captivity and asks the remaining Guardians to meet her on Titan, Thanos' destroyed homeworld, Stark and Parker have rescued Strange and killed Maw, ejecting him from his ship, they land at Titan and meet Quill, Drax, and Mantis. The group forms a plan to remove Thanos' Infinity Gauntlet, while Strange looks into the future, he finds only one in millions of possible futures in which Thanos loses. Thanos arrives, justifying his plan is necessary to ensure the survival of a universe threatened by overpopulation, the group manage to subdue him, until Nebula deduces that he killed Gamora. Quill is enraged and retaliates, allowing Thanos to break away and overpower the group, Strange surrenders the Time Stone in exchange for Thanos sparing Stark, Thanos then departs for Earth. In Wakanda, Rogers reunites with Bucky Barnes aka Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) before Thanos and his army invade, the Avengers, alongside T'Challa aka Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and the Wakandan forces, mount a defence while Shuri (Letitia Wright) works to extract the Mind Stone from Vision. Banner is unable to transform into the Hulk, he fights in Stark's Hulkbuster armour; Thor, Rocket, and Groot arrive to reinforce the defenders, while Midnight, Obsidian, and Glaive are killed, and their army is routed. Maximoff attempts to destroy the Mind Stone, but Thanos arrives and retrieves the stone from Vision, destroying him, Thor severely wounds Thanos, but with all stones completing the Infinity Gauntlet, Thanos activates it, clicking his fingers and teleporting away. Thanos' plan succeeds, as a result, half of all life across the universe disintegrates, including Barnes, T'Challa, Groot, Maximoff, Wilson, Mantis, Drax, Quill, Strange, and Parker; Stark and Nebula remain on Titan, while Banner, Okoye (Danai Gurira), Rhodes, Rocket, Rogers, Romanoff, M'Baku (Winston Duke), and Thor are left on Wakanda, meanwhile Thanos rests and recuperates on another planet. After the credits, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) witness many people disintegrating, causing destruction, Fury is able to transmit a distress signal before he and Hill disintegrate, the device displays a star insignia on a red-and-blue background (meaning Captain Marvel). Also starring Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, William Hurt as Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross and Stan Lee as the Bus Driver. All of the cast as the superheroes are fantastic as usual, and Brolin is brilliant as the malevolent supervillain, there is a lot going on at once, but thankfully I followed it all, the special effects are spectacular, and the constant explosions and fight sequences are exciting, I wasn't expecting to end so dramatically and sombre, I cannot wait to see what happens next and how the heroes will be returned, overall this is a fantastic fantasy action adventure. It was nominated for Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Very good!",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

760,15 May 2018,Sidbono,4," Overratted
","I saw this film the Thursday it came out and I wanted to see if what everyone was saying was true and it wasn't. I'm gonna go through the thing I thought were good and bad.
Good:
#1 CGI, visuals
The CGI in this film was really, really good. aside from a couple shots of Thanos the CGI was basically perfect. The CGI on Thanos made him look like an actual big purple man. Even getting little facial expressions and markings on his face that other company's wouldn't care to put the detail in for. The visuals in the film made everything look really interesting and gave the film some eye candy all throughout.
#2 Thanos 
I would still say Loki from the first Avengers was better than Thanos but damn Thanos in this film was relentless and intimidating. Though I didn't care for his motivation, he was much better than Ultron mainly because Thanos never spit out any dumb and painfully unfunny humor.
#3 Characters (I liked) and character interactions
The only characters in the film I liked were: Iron Man, Hulk (or more appropriately Bruce Banner ) , Spider-man, Doctor Strange, Thor, and Thanos. I've already talked about Thanos so I'll talk about the others. The Interactions between Peter, Tony, and Strange were probably one of the best parts of the movie. They were actually kind of funny and were really entertaining. Thor's interactions between the Guardians were good. I didn't find it funny but it was entertaining.
#4 Action
The action was really entertaining and fun. It was creative and done really well. and of course it looked great. There was only one shot of shaky cam and it such a bad shot I literally couldn't see anything.
Bad Things
#1 Pacing
The pacing in the first act wasn't very good. every time it cut to a new group of people the film was just frantically trying to catch up with itself. It gets better in the second and third but but every time it cut to the Guardians the film just came to a grinding halt.
#2 Humor 
Humor is subjective, I know that. but the humor in the film was painfully unfunny and it wasn't made all that better by the crowd laughing every ten seconds in the theater.
#3 Character deaths and other characters
All the other characters I didn't care for mainly because they either did one thing or nothing. I get that a film with this big of a cast can't include everyone, but damn, to many characters did nothing, they were kind of just their. It's not all the better by the fact that most of the characters that died were characters that did nothing. All the original Avengers were left alive, and I feel like it would've been better if they killed at least one or two of them. the character deaths also weren't that heartbreaking or sad. Some just died and the Film moved on. The only death I cared for was Spider-Man cause he actually had a scene that was at least a little bit sad.
#4 Romances
The romances were just terrible. Wanda and Visions romance was just extremely awkward that was also accompanied with terrible dialogue. The romance between Bruce and Black Widow came back for one or two lines of dialogue and it's literally never acknowledged again.
#5 Gamora's death.
This has a section of it's own because of how horribly obvious it was. It actually amazes me that people were surprised that she died. after she said a line to Star-Lord about killing her if Thanos catches her I instantly knew that she was going to die. and what do you know she died about 30 minutes later. I personally feel it would've been more effective if she started begging Peter to kill her when she actually got captured.
#6 Star-Lord 
His entire character was ruined for me. At a point in the film when Thanos is pinned down and they almost have the infinity gauntlet off him and Peter decides to hit Thanos in the face waking him up and thus dooming half the universe. It felt extremely out of character and I thought it would've been better if Drax did it. Thanos did destroy his planet and his family so shouldn't he do it. He is more of a loose canon and Peter is more logical. You might say he didn't attack him because he knew it was a bad idea and he didn't attack him earlier. But that's because Thanos had his guard up and would've easily destroyed him. So, Star- Lord killed everybody.
#7 Wanda (Scarlet Witch)
For my last section I would like to talk about Wanda. She could've easily defeated Thanos because of how powerful she is. There's a point on the Wakanda battlefield where five giant rolling saws are released and she comes out and destroys them instantly. And if she has the power to destroy an infinity stone she should be in battle killing everything.
In conclusion this film is massively overrated and shouldn't be the 15th best film of all time according to Imdb. This is a 4/10.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","Avengers: Infinity War (2018) is an epic blockbuster that scratches that superhero itch you've felt since its trailer. With a cast as big as Thanos and action that blows you back into your seat, it's hard not to re-queue when the film is over. 
Unlike the destruction caused by Loki in the first film and Ultron in the second, with this film, Thanos brings a whole new definition of threat. The heroes' greatest battle begins here and the special effects, acting, emotion and intertwining story arcs make for an exiting Marvel experience. 
The humour element was well balanced, unlike the changing trend with some of the latest Marvel instalments, and the chemistry between characters seemed authentic. I do admit, however, that some scenes seemed disjointed and proved to block the flow of the narrative - a minor nit-picking issue. The pacing of the film flowed well and at no point, in the 2.5 hours, did I feel bored.

","The 10 year build up of Marvel movies was definitely worth it, and certainly worth the hype. ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018), directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. Starring Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Josh Brolin, and many more! All I can say is, just like ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" (2014), this movie was mind-blowing. Mentally, I was not prepared for this masterpiece of a movie. I went in there with high hopes, and those hopes were exceeded. Everything ranging from the acting, the special effects, the story, etc. It was all first-rate (AND THEN SOME!) Now, one thing that can ruin a movie is annoying one-liners, or jokes. Marvel movies are full of them! However, this film keeps them to a minimum, which was very refreshing. They're finally realizing how unnecessary most one-liners are in their movies. What jokes they do have in ""Avengers: Infinity War"", are funny, and they are few and far between. It is a very well-balanced film from action, to comedy, and to drama. It was one of those rare experiences where a movie was so good, that the theater was silent during the whole movie. When that happens, you know you did a good job with your movie. I do have to confess something. A lot of you know that I didn't like the ""Black Panther"" (2018) movie, I also really hate the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" movies, ""Ant-Man"" (2015), and the ""Doctor Strange"" (2016) movie. I was worried that those characters might ruin the movie, or be distracting. But, they were not bad at all. Like I said, Black Panther works better as a team player, and so does Doctor Strange and the Guardians of the Galaxy. In solo movies, those characters are dull, boring, cringeworthy and sometimes obnoxious! However, when they're part of a team, or playing side characters, they're not obnoxious at all. Also, since Ant-Man isn't in this movie, he's not a factor! Is this the best superhero movie? It's phenomenal, but there are some that I still personally like better. Is it the new best Marvel movie? Well, it's certainly in my top 5 on my Marvel Cinematic Universe ranking list! Overall, the cast is insane, but Josh Brolin as Thanos really steals the show. I will not spoil anything about this movie for you. You'll have to go see the movie to find out for yourself! Believe me, you won't be the same. If you think you know what this movie will be like from watching the trailers, you have no idea what you're in for! Props to you, Anthony and Joe Russo. You guys did a Marvel-ous job! I look forward to the sequel, and other future movies with your involvement. It's worth the money to buy on DVD, or to find some other method of watching it.

","Infinity War was just about as hyped as a movie can get. It had the most viewed online trailer ever, was #3 all time in pre-sales, and was first teased back in 2012 with The Avengers, and most of the MCU movies since then have all been building up to this. Ever since the Infinity Stones were first introduced in the first Thor movie, people have believed that we would see Thanos' quest to collect the all on the big screen. Perhaps most impressive is that it had the biggest opening weekend ever, beating Star Wars: The Force Awakens in the U.S. with $257,000,000, and beating Fate of the Furious globally with $640,000,000.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","If you love all the other mcu films, you will probably love this one. If you are an avid film enthusiast like myself, you will probably have similar complaints to what im going to say.
For one, this film tries to focus on more things than what it is actually capable of pulling off. There are so many characters in the film that characters like black widow and black panther are reduced to seconds of screen time. Characters that are actually somewhat integral to the plot are so one dimensional they might as well get seconds of screen time.
On top of that, characters that usually bring forth tons of charm regardless of the movie's quality (like thor or star lord) are completely unlikable in this movie. Actors like Robert Downey Jr completely phoned in their performances, and it made for a dull atmosphere even compared to other sub-par mcu films. 
The direction in this movie is TERRIBLE. It was so poorly handled. For example, Gamorrah's death scene was shot like a low budget sappy music video. The shots were so distracting I actually laughed at some attempted dramatic moments in the film.
Overall this film is not good cinema. If you enjoy mindless entertainment with an underdeveloped villain and hipster captain America then this is the movie for you. If however, you want some form of artistic value in your films, I would skip this one and go watch the hiding place (its much less of a waste of your time).",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","When the first Avengers film was released in 2012, there was much hype for it, much like Infinity War, but it actually lived up to it. Fast forward six years later, with Infinity War and many new members in the crew, and now fans are given a rushed action film with cheesy one liners. Upon going into the film, I checked the writing on IMDb and saw it was a 9.0/10. Seeing the rating really intrigued me, in which I was expecting so much only to be disappointed. 
1. Thanos in no way intimidated me like he did when I read the comics. Josh Brolin could have done better at the role. I found him more intimidating in Labor Day, or the Goonies back when he was 17.
 2. There was just too many stories for one movie. In order for it to work, this film would have needed to be nearly 5 hours long, like Gone With The Wind. 
3. Why did that massive battle scene on earth with Cap and the rest of crew resemble Star Wars: The Phantom Menace? Literally all I could think of was Jar Jar Binks throwing blue balls at Thanos' army and calling it a day.
 4. Out of all 80 of the main cast, I felt the only characters with the best chemistry were Rocket and Thor. 
5. What was up with Bruce Banner having hard time turning to Hulk? Is that his way of having an Erectile Dysfunction? I mean Hulktile Dysfuntion... That whole bit was just weird. 
6. Some of the characters, like Starlord, Drax, and The Vision were not the same characters they were in previous films. Starlord is smart, sarcastic, and cocky. In this film, he's dumb. Same with Drax, he was real insecure and always on edge. In this film he's just there. 
Lastly, The Vision. What happened to the wise man we saw in Age of Ultron? Yes, he had feelings, and I understand he had evolved, but has millions of traits and personalities. I don't understand how such a strong character became so weak. Overall, this film was pretty mediocre when it came to acting and the action scenes. We've seen them all before. Of course being a comic book/superhero fan for nearly 20 years, I will watch the next film, but most likely wait till it releases to redbox or other streaming services. 
I rate this film a 5/10 because 1. The all star cast. 2. Decent action and CGI that will most likely attract younger viewers. 3. Rocket and Thor's chemistry. 4. Scarlett Johansson. 5. It's Marvel. Other than that, if you haven't seen the film, just wait till it's released on DVD or Netflix. Not worth the trip.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","There are two reasons Thanos is a titan. First, he is big. Second, he comes from a planet named Titan. Once upon a time that planet faced a serious problem. The population was too big and the resources were not enough. That was when Thanos came forth and said he had a solution, and that was to kill half of their population so the remaining half would prosper, and he wanted to kill individuals regardless of their social position and wealth, so it would be fair. He was labeled mad, but the problem of the planet, eventually, got worse, and now there are two things to say about these titans. First, the planet is a wasteland with no apparent life. Second, our mad titan Thanos has now been flying from planet to planet with his big army, killing half of all life on every planet on his way. But something has changed. There are six supernatural artefacts known as the infinity stones, and they give their owner colossal power should the owner be big and strong enough to deal with their energy. Thanos, the mad titan, has been collecting these stones for their power, and should he get his hands on all six, he will no longer need to kill anyone anywhere in a fight, because the six stones will, apparently, enable him to kill all the life in the entire Universe with the snap of his fingers.

","I was a bit worried about this film. Yes, Marvel is nearly perfect, but I was also worried that we would have another ""Spider-Man 3"" or ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice"" situation where it's too overstuffed with characters that it becomes hard to follow. This is not the case. It does jump around from place to place frequently, and I wish the plot had flowed better, but I was still able to follow what was going on. This has possibly the best villain in all of the MCU! Thanos is the Darth Vader of this franchise! He's the villain you love to hate and are genuinely afraid of. The actors bounce off of each other very well and the dialogue is as fast-paced and witty as we've come to expect from Marvel. While at times, it does feel like watching a bunch of video game cutscenes edited together, the movie is so enthralling that my first reaction to the credits (other than pure surprise for reasons I don't dare spoil) was ""It's over already?! It just started 20 minutes ago? What? It started almost 3 hours ago?! How is that possible?"" That's how much this film pulled me in! It's well worth the 10 year wait! It's amazing to see all these characters interact with each other! There are some really amazing shots and moments, which again, I won't spoil. There's a reason Marvel was unusually secretive with this film. Other than the story not flowing as well as it should have, there isn't anything to complain about with this film.

","I have been told by my friends to watch this movie , in theaters but unfortunately or FORTUNATELY, I ignored to do so and recently I watched this movie, and I was glad that I pass the plan to go for this one. I am not a BIG fan of this Franchise ,but the last installment, which I saw, Avengers- ""The Civil War"" , which had different script as compare to the other heroic movies. The Idea of fight - against each other , was not new , as we saw in Batman Vs Superman prior to Civil War, but in that movie something was missing and which results the less interest of the viewers.
This movie, is a very gigantic movie because of the characters and their super powers, so there's no question that kids won't like it ! They do, off course. Movie, has very different kind of emotional scenes, I can hope, they were emotional enough to make the fans cry ( Avengers' fans again). So apart from the mesmerizing script , the thing which was a bit more amusing was you don't expect , comedy from HULK, c'mon, keep the comedy for the kid - spider man , not for a guy like HULK. But from the Director has a different point of view- might be an experiment , which results in a successful attempt. So in short , it's a movie specifically for the fans of AVENGERS Franchise, not for every one. Fans & kids will love this one, as they see converting their print media into visual media.

We also got to see a comedic fight between Quill, Drax, Mantis, Iron Man, Spider-Man, and Doctor Strange. After some confusion, they realized they were on the same team and fought together against Thanos. I also liked the plot and story of this movie. I really liked how it was all about Thanos' quest to find the Infinity Stones, and all the different places he had to go. I liked how the story was written to have all the heroes we have been introduced to (except Scott and Clint due to their house arrest) in the movie, it was beautifully written. The writing did however cause for the Avengers to be split up the entire movie. I actually liked that because it had the Civil War feel to it with the two separate final battles. The Avengers are also still technically split up, so I though it worked out.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

1. Thanos..yes he is the villain I did not know I wanted to see..for a long time I was reluctant of how Marvel studios would introduce this guy..I mean until infinity wars Thanos didn't look as very promising villain more like the purple muscle-dude on the chair.. but the deepness of his character, his personality I didn't see that coming..The mad Titan was worth the waiting..his philosophy, his relationship with his daughter and the snap of his fingers..GOD where do you go after all these?
2.So many encounters..I mean if you are a nerd as am I you never really get enough of these.. seeing all these super heroes team up was giving me a nerdorgasm after another..
3.Closure..Many of our favorite superheroes faced some of their deepest emotions (and then most of them died)..If you were curious to find out how Lokie feels about his brother?How Gamora feels about Thanos?or Quill?This is your type of movie..
4. The long game..Now this is a huge spoiler but the key character for all that happens in the movie is by far Dr Strange.. Just pay attention to the dude..this might save you some tears...no need to say more..just watch the movie
5. The Hulk-Banner relationship.. This might sound silly but I feel that there is some deeper explanation to Hulk's behavior that really intrigues me to find out. If that is not the case it still is hilarious as hell..",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

869,26 April 2018,TheMovieDiorama,8," Avengers: Infinity War is a decade culmination of strategic cinematic building with triumphant results.
","10 years since 'Iron Man' commenced the cinematic universe. 10 years. Just let that sink in. Now, the superhero soap opera draws closer to its conclusion and the stakes are higher than ever. The Avengers, Guardians and a myriad of supporting heroes encounter the wrath of the villainous Thanos. They must unite and prevent him from harnessing all six infinity stones, because if he does...we all know what will happen. Total universal annihilation! With each chapter, the MCU becomes more and more predicable as the narrative follows the exact same three act structure. Whilst there is a tiny sense of predictability here, the sheer boldness of the Russo brothers' execution has made for an excitingly tense blockbuster that I'm sure will leave many in awe with what they just witnessed. The colossal enormity of this chapter, the raging pressure for the directors, the astronomical expectation from the fans, all immeasurable factors that somehow have been measured and implemented to create heroic entertainment. The intricate balance of all the superheroes felt like an impossible task, however each member received enough screen time to validate their presence within the story. All the actors performed with sincerity, particularly during the more emotional moments. Finally we are presented with a multi-dimensional antagonist who's motives, may unquestionably be evil, are nonetheless relatable. You see his perspective. The inclusion of Thanos' backstory and the focus on the ferocious power of the Infinity Gauntlet cements him as the strongest adversary within the MCU. Impressive visual effects and memorable action set pieces ensures the thrills are consistently imaginative throughout. It's certainly a behemoth, where the narrative's pacing is slightly inconsistent during the first half and the humour misses more than it hits, but with such confident direction they have made an impossible chapter possible. Geeks, fans and film lovers, rejoice! However that ending though, left me speechless...",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

904,29 April 2018,tmpsvita,9," The film that has everything that was missing from the other Marvel movies
","10 years, 19 films, 15 billion dollars and a huge fanbase composed of an extremely homogeneous audience of women, men, children, teenagers, adults and the elderly; In short, Marvel with its MCU has created an unprecedented film phenomenon that seems not to want to decrease but instead does nothing but expand more and more from year to year, especially in the American and world box office where it continues to break records on records so much to create almost an economic monopoly while the DC counterpart, as much as I appreciate it, remains helpless to look with great envy.
All this immense work to get to this point, to get to this huge, impressive and epic, as well as exciting, dark and, however difficult it may seem, even deep film; all this to get to ""Avengers: Infinity War"".
A waited film, as already mentioned, for ten years and a huge number of fans and not only, which had the task of being able to bring together all the Marvel superheroes so far cinematically known, to link the various films, to give a species of conclusion, which will then be more concretized in the fourth, to this complex scheme that is the expanded Marvel universe, and above all to succeed, at least, to satisfy the great expectations that have grown together with this universe.
To do all this, Joss When, after creating ""Avengers"" and ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"", is replaced by two brothers, Joe and Anthony Russo, former directors of the last two chapters of the trilogy dedicated to Steve Rogers aka Captain America, ""Captain America: the Winter Soldier"" and ""Captain America: Civil War.
The two directors have managed to give the film a heart and a soul, you can perceive in each frame, sequence and dialogue the love on their part and of each of the actors in the film that have invested in this project and, above all in this movie.
They also managed to give to Infinity War probably what really distinguished this to all the other Marvel films, that is an almost perfect villain, Thanos, a villain who does not believe in his ego to be such because he is motivated by a real, tangible and understandable motivation, a villain who is able to experience feelings beyond anger and desire for destruction, a villain with whom the spectator almost manages to tie because as immoral and ruthless as he may be it is also almost understandable, a villain that has not only the characteristic to be such but that has different facets, different nuances and different reasons that push he, almost against his will, to be such, in short an extremely complex villain, characterized in an exemplary manner and that marks a real strength and turn to the internal of the MCU; if there is something missing in each of the previous films that are part of this universe is the presence of a great bad guy, absolutely not flat or forgettable but that proves a real challenge for heroes protagonists.
It is also interpreted with great credibility by an extraordinary Josh Brolin, which we will see soon also in the role of Cable in the sequel to Deadpool, who immerses himself totally in the character and manages to be worthy of his intense and really complicated role.
The Russo also impress the audience with a balanced and well calibrated alternation of ironic moments with others darker, of moments more emotional and moving with others more sensational and with a strong visual impact. They also succeeded in giving the right time to each character, perhaps one of the most difficult tasks given the large number of them and the duration of ""just"" two and a half hours.
Basically they managed to make a film not difficult to work, almost impossible to achieve, they did a job that will enter, if it has not already done, in the history of cinema, which will be studied in film schools and will act as an example for many others movie.
Nothing of this film is not in the right place or does not work, especially if considered the technical aspect that really turns out to be a real triumph: extraordinary special effects, extremely credible and realistic despite their abundant amount, especially in the realization of Thanos give the best of themselves; a direction, as already said, impeccable; an extremely suggestive and exciting cinematography, with truly sensational colors; an incisive, noisy, perfectly contextualized soundtrack that gives the right tone and the right atmosphere to the whole film; and a perfect editing in every sequence.
An unforgettable film, impossible for a fan to see objectively because it touches the emotions that have formed over the past ten years, an immense, extreme, epic film and I could continue for many lines giving it the best compliments for a blockbusters of this size.

","I took a break from seeing MCU movies at the theatre, since 2017's offerings didn't appeal to me, but having enjoyed some of the previous solo movies/half-enjoying the previous two Avengers movies, I checked out A:IW for the characters I *cared* about, knowing full-well time would also be spent on those I *didn't* care about. We begin with Thor, Loki and the film's big bad, Thanos. It feels like Thor got more screentime here than he did in the two previous Avengers movies. Most surprisingly, his main interaction's with Rocket from the GotG movies, who he calls ""Rabbit"". Like in A:AoU, Thor is absent for long periods of time/shows up towards the end, seemingly with a means to defeating the villain...that doesn't quite work out this time.

Old grudges will have to be put aside, egos will have to be kept in check, and unlikely alliances will have to be formed as all of the world's heroes (Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Star Lord, Doctor Strange, Black Panther, et al) must band together to take on an adversary unlike any they've ever encountered before. This intense, sprawling, multi-character saga has the requisite amount of witty humor and relentless, edge of your seat action, but pushes far beyond the boundaries of the comic book world and emerges as an ambitious, allegorical, and often heartbreaking spectacle of heroism and sacrifice that will resonate with viewers long after the film is over. Goes on for a long time, but seeing ten years' worth of MCU characters united for a colossal front is more than enough to compensate. Brolin makes Thanos a compelling, multilayered, and somewhat tragic villain who is sure to be remembered for years to come; a solid outing for non-fans, and a sure-fire hit for dedicated followers. ***½",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","I think that since the original marvel movies (Iron-man, Thor, captain America,..), the movies have become more meaningful over the past years. I really liked the new spider man and black panther, and absolutely loved Thor Ragnarok. I thought civil war was the worst movie in the franchise and it gave me a lower expectation for upcoming avengers films (yes it was technically a captain America film, but I mean it really wasn't was it..), but this movie was so well written with some emotional moments, I'd totally recommend it to people who enjoy a long, breathtaking but also overwhelming movie.

958,2 May 2023,dakotadickenson-83457,10," A film that lived up to expectations
","Avengers: Infinity War is hands down one of the greatest superhero films made to date. It brings every current MCU hero together to fight the common enemy that fans alike have been waiting years to see come to the big screen. When mad titan Thanos is on a mission the collect all six infinity stones, it's up to Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, Wong, Spider-Man, The Guardians of the Galaxy, and the rest of the remaining Avengers to fight the powerful titan in a fight to save the universe. So first off, The Russo Brothers did a fantastic job bringing all these hero's together for this film. Robert Downey Jr is great as always as Iron Man putting his new nanotechnology to good use. Chris Hemsworth Thor is magnificent, bringing us probably one of the best versions of the character we have ever seen. Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk is also great even though we got more of Bruce Banner instead of Hulk in this film. Chris Evans as Captain America is great as always showing us more of his character that is now on the run including Scarlett Johansson's Natasha Romanoff/ Black Widow and Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson/Falcon. The Guardians of the Galaxy are great too with there interactions with some of the Avengers. Zoe Saldana's Gamora stands out the most out of all them in this film. Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther is also fantastic that is not only just joining the fight against Thanos, but bringing the whole nation of Wakanda with him along for the fight including Sebastian Stan's Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier who is also great. The best character throughout the whole film that really made this film as great as it is, is Josh Brolin's Thanos. He really brings the long awaited character to the big screen in fashion, as the film mostly follows his journey to collect the infinity stones, while the Avengers try to stop him. On the journey, he must deal with what his destiny is, tragedy, and stopping anyone that gets in his way. Thanos is so far my favorite villain to ever come to the MCU mainly, because I think he has the best purpose out of any villain in the MCU for what he's doing and the way it's captured is absolutely extraordinary. Overall, Avengers: Infinity War is hands down one of the greatest superhero movies ever made, while also bringing us all the hero's we've waited so long to see in one film as well as bringing us one of the greatest superhero villains we have ever seen.

i am going to make it short from here because what i am about to say might worry some people i am fan of both marvel and dc and its sad to see whats going on recently marvel still doing nice but dc is in a mess the last good dc films were the dark knight trilogy of christian bale as batman honestly,both marvel and dc comics film makers need to up their game i really hope that black widow and Eternals movies will do great in phase 4 & dc should start all over cancel justice league and wonder woman as dc movies are not working at all reboot everything again they must because if they don't then its really endgame for them not joking because guys a new comic book hero is about to enter the competition soon in the valiant comic universe based on valiant comics Vin Diesel will star as bloodshot in the film the quality level on that film will be insane it will defeat and own these kids at marvel and dc comics its going to be extreme and Rated R not for kids,so marvel and both dc should start aiming at adults,this avengers infinity war was good attempt but again they need to stop making films pg or lame for kids marvel and dc need to grow up endgame and justice league are examples of poor film making.why not make animation entirely then if they want to cater to the kids,if you are making a feature live film then better make it good,this one film showed that it was worth the effort and not really about money the acting,story everything was good,you cant go and make a comic book film without a Cgi what would that be it would be just another movie with actors acting and there are films like that out there like Jason Bourne or some Steven Seagal films etc so this one was a good mix of Cgi and live action,endgame really made me angry as everything looked out of place,infinity was set a standard and marvel blew the chance and ruined the sequel movie,always remember that a good film is not about awards or cash it made at box office its about repeat value look at the matrix trilogy of Keanu Reeves i know i am going off topic a big but yes that's how films should be made so these guys better watch out and fix their mistakes or on purpose errors,infinity war made me glued to the seat and not move for this nice film my rating is 5/10 and i love iron man.watch it",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

977,29 April 2018,rustonreviews,9," Bombastically ambitious, completely exhilarating and emotional, Infinity War is truly epic.
","Everything about Marvel's latest addition in its sprawling, epic MCU franchise feels overwhelmingly massive. Boasting the largest cast of any Marvel movie yet, a storyline on a colossal scale and a supervillain finally getting his chance to step forth into the limelight, Avengers: Infinity War has much to live up to. Since its genesis in 2008 with Iron Man, the MCU has been thriving for an impressive ten years, continuously expanding and, for better or for worse, birthing the term 'cinematic universe'. Thanos (Josh Brolin) searches high and low across the universe to complete his collection of infinity stones. Once all have been retrieved and inserted into his golden gauntlet, he will be granted world dominating power and become an unstoppable juggernaut of destruction. With so much at stake, the Avengers, along with the Guardians of the Galaxy and various other superheroes including Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), must unite to defeat Thanos before their world is torn apart. 
As much as I was anticipating Infinity War, I was also anxious due to the sheer weight of it all. Sure, the geeky fanboy in me was psyched to see such an ensemble, but there was still the fear that the film would feel too overcrowded. Thankfully, the Russo brothers pull it off with such grandeur, resulting in one of the very best Marvel films yet. ",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","When I went into this movie I had already heard the praise, so naturally I had high expectations. With that in mind, it's even more impressive how much I ended up liking this movie. Marvel really suprised me with the direction they went with this story. I expected a boring villain, a few cool CGI-infested fightscenes and an epic final showdown where all the heroes gather, but this movie went in a completely different direction with almost every aspect. The visuals and score are obviously good, but nothing groundbreaking, as per usual, and the plot is really simple: A bunch of people try to stop an overpowered alien from obtaining the ultimate power, nothing special there. The pacing is solid though, and even though the plot isn't super interesting, it's still passable, and is made even better by this movie's greatest strength; the characters. This movie incorporates almost every single character previously seen into the movie, and makes it work by not really having any filler. The conversations are simple yet engaging, the characters are, as always, well-defined and entertaining. The movie juggles its different tones very effectively, it has both great comedy and some of the strongest emotional moments in the entire franchise. The biggest suprise of this movie however, is its villain. MCU villains has been bad more often than not, so it was incredibly satisfying to finally get a villain that is truly fenomenal. Thanos is by far the best villain Marvel has ever created, and a lot of that is thanks to the human attributes he has. Despite being a giant space-monster, he doesn't feel comical at all. He feels threatening, and while his goal is simple, his motivation makes sense, and it's fascinating to watch him talk about how he is right in doing all these evil things. He also has a strong emotional core, which is showcased the clearest in his conversations with Gamora. The movie also has a very unexpected ending, which caught me completely off-guard, and frustrated me a lot, but in a good way. All this, combined with the usual great performances and comedy we've gotten used to seeing from Marvel, makes for one of the best superhero movies released this decade.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

A lot of great action and surprisingly a lot of comedy still too! Spiderman had the best lines! A very good villain and overall super fun, yet darker movie. Not quite DC level dark, but emotionally I suppose. I did feel close to tears at one point actually, but it's because I've grown very attached to these characters. Of course it ended with a big cliff hanger to be continued next year, but I knew that going in.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","I had almost no expectations for Infinity War when I entered the theater chamber to see it last year. It was several weeks after the movie's initial release so the theater itself was fairly light on visitors for Infinity War in particular. I was pretty much alone through my experience of the movie. For context, I have only a surface level knowledge of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I have seen quite a bit of the older movies but only know most of the more recent characters through friends and online reviewers and the like. So, as a normie without any great attachment to most of the prior films, you can imagine my surprise when this movie becomes one of my favorite superhero movies ever made.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","Do you remember crossover episodes on TV shows? You got a mix of both shows that were crossing over but never quite the magic and strength that those shows had when they were independent of each other. That's kind of how I feel about ""Avengers"" movies. It's great to see all of the heroes team up and kick butt, but at the same time you never quite get some of the great character moments that you do in their solo films as they all struggle and fight for screen time. The fights with Thanos (Josh Brolin) are awesome, love the cliffhanger. Some of the CGI honestly doesn't look too great though.

","In fact, the main character isn't any one of our superheroes at all, but Thanos. But the movie isn't told from Thanos' point of view. Instead, Infinity War does an excellent job of explaining why thisbad guy wants to have all of the Infinity Stones. Make no mistake, he's still the enemy. However, Infinity War does such a good job that at a few parts you nod alongand say to yourself, ""OK Thanos, now I know why you want to do this.""
The biggest surprise about Infinity War is how well the movie flows together. At no point is the film at all confusing. Weunderstand who is fighting whom, and what the risks and rewards are for each fight. It's not overcrowded, like one
might believe, even with so many heroes involved.

It starts fast, there is a battle scene with lots of dead and dying but they're not your typical soldiers, these are Asgard's finest, including Thor and Loki. World killing Thanos casually picks up one dying soldier and brings him to stage center, it's Thor........and we're on our way, there is an inevitability here that matches, for the most part, the scale of what is being presented - the killing of 50% of all sentient creatures in.........the universe. There is a quest, but depending on your POV, it's not necessarily a noble quest. A great coalition is brought together to battle Thanos and it's mostly not the cheesy typical ""the gangs all here"" Marvel cluster f__K, this is a big war and everyone is needed, even the guardians of the galaxy and their insipid banter, really out of place in this movie, as was the main guardian's move when they were about to stop Thanos, super mechanically maladroit ""solution, again, the scale of the movie's intent was far beyond this hamfisted scene. This is quibbling though, the pathos embedded in this movie allowed it to achieve escape velocity, Thanos is not Sauron, he as a soul, he has deep feelings for what he does, he sacrifices that which he loves the most for what he believes are noble motives (that's the main problem with people, we all got our reasons). And Thanos most astounding of all, ""wins"", he get's all the infinity stones and 50% of the Universe's citizens simply turn into ash including many of the superheroes.....that was something I did not expect, so not the typical US blockbuster..........most of the apparent good guys die and the villain wins, resting in the long sunset, enjoying the fruits of his efforts.

","..subjective."" Would be the obvious answer.
Looking through the review section I hardly see any numbers between 1 and 10. So let me get my armchair and psychoanalyze this real quick. 
Some people love to love, some people love to hate.
My rating would be 72 out of 100 by the way.
I admittedly enjoy the MCU as it has thus far served me with some unpretentious colorful entertainment and some neat characters. They treat these characters respectfully and fairly uncompromising throughout various different writers, directors and styles.
It's a unique enterprise that is usually quite enjoyable. But are any of those movies actually worthy of a 10 out of 10 based on a scale that includes all films ever made. Absolutely not! Would most film buffs resent my 8 out of 10 rating. Definitely!
But opinions really are quite subjective and I rate movies based on competence and entertainment value. The latter of which is where all the guilty pleasures fit in. I was damn surprised that this movie didn't turn out a cluster. It really should have, considering it's large cast and insane plot. But it feels very well paced for the most part and flows pretty well. And the big climax of the movie feels actually climactic within the entire MCU.

Avengers: Infinity War is not a movie in any traditional sort of sense; it's a combined recap of a previous episode and intro to another. This is two and a half hours of characters coming and going, all of which are more or less invincible and have no ground-rules set for their co-existence. The action sequences and battles are flat, unaccounted for and thus have no relevance.

","The story arc continues as ""Earth's Mightiest Heroes"" face Thanos, their most implacable and powerful foe yet, whose goal is nothing less than the elimination of half of the universe's denizens. To do this, he must acquire all six of the infinity stones, colourful MacGuffins with a complex metaphysical backstory - a plot device that allows for a series embedded stories involving subsets of heroes and villains. The story is quite good and relatively internally consistent, and the characters interesting and well worked out (although I have my usual suspension of disbelief problem with The Avengers somewhat asymmetrical powers: Black Widow knows martial arts and is a good shot, Thor is an immortal God who can fly though space and withstand the focussed power of a degenerating neutron star, yet both seem to get equal hero billing). Even the most heavy made-up (or completely CGI) characters have a lot of personality, especially (IMO) chief villain Thanos, emotionally-expressive Mantis, and my personal favorite: giant dwarf Eitri (Peter Dinklage). The script manages to hit a good balance of action/drama and comedy (tricky to do and often a weak point in the genre). The ending is a set-up for the next film, in which we can expect Captain Marvel to put in an appearance (perhaps a harbinger for the next generation of Avengers). Given the God-like powers of some of the heroes and the fact that Thanos can now control reality and time (always a convenient plot gimmick), pretty much anything could happen.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","Loved it when I first saw it, and love it more every time I watch it. While it may not have the exact depth in writing as other films in its genre, Infinity War makes up for that with many great characters moments, a clever balance of humor and darkness (and this film is considerably dark when compared to other MCU installments), breathtaking action scenes that are well-placed and not just used for the sake of having a big action scene to keep audiences entertained. Of course, Infinity War is part of the broader film series, the Marvel Cinematic Universe and although catching up on previous installments in the franchise can certainly enhance the viewing experience, I do still believe it works fabulously as a stand-alone film; I actually like it best when thinking about it as a race against time or heist film. (also, case in point, I saw this movie for the first time with almost no prior knowledge of the MCU, so take that as you will) On top of that, the villain of the story, Thanos, has become iconic in pop culture, and for good reason. While he certainly earns the name of the ""Mad Titan"", his intentions are at least comprehensible and that to me is not an easy balance to strike; many villains in films suffer in writing due to this imbalance. I could go on about this movie as it is somewhere at least in my top 100 films, but I will leave it at that.

1082,1 May 2018,jg_1977,9," One hell of a first part
","Let me start by saying that I am an avid MCU fan and have seen all the previous entries, however I can acknowledge when the franchise goes wrong (the sequels to Iron Man, Thor, and Avengers comes to mind). Infinity War did an utterly incredible job of tying together 10 years of storytelling. For what this movie was meant to be, I don't think they could have changed a thing to make it any better (save a few lines that didn't land or jokes that ran a bit too long). The acting and dialogue is on par with the past few movies, with good performances all around, but some really stand out ones from Chris Hemsworth, Zoe Saldana, and of course Josh Brolin. The action is great, there's good close cut hand to hand scenes that the Russos are famous for and more impressive sprawling epic battle scenes as well. The CGI is mostly good, especially on Thanos and the alien planets, however a few of the children of Thanos did look like 4 year old video game characters to me. The biggest criticism I've heard of this movie is that it's inaccessible to non-MCU fans, which I think is perfectly valid. If you've only seen a scattered few of the movies, you could very likely get lost as they don't spend time re-introducing characters and previous plot lines. I will say however, that at this point, 19 movies in, you should probably have developed an opinion on the MCU by now. Those who thoroughly enjoy the stories and characters will be caught up and this movie will blow them away. For people who are more casual fans who just go for the action and jokes and aren't wrapped up in the overarching plots and character arcs, Infinity War can still deliver exactly what they want. Lastly, for people who just flat out dislike the franchise, this movie won't change their mind. It's more of what we've gotten in the previous 18 entries but on a more epic scale. As a hard-core fan, this movie had me wanting to jump out of my seat and cheer at some moments, and cry at others. Infinity War is truly the reward fans of the franchise are getting after 10 years. I will say however, that it is hard to rank it compared to the rest of the MCU. Since this movie ends on such a large cliff hanger that must be resolved in the follow up, it's very hard to look at it as a complete story. My guess is that people will lump Infinity War and Avengers 4 together as one large movie, much like people do with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1 and 2. If the follow up sticks the landing and completes this story in a compelling way, then this movie would probably land in my top 5 just above the first Avengers, but conversely it could get dragged down if the sequel doesn't hold up. I cannot wait to see how this story is wrapped up next year, and strongly encourage fans of the franchise to check this one out in theaters. If you haven't yet discovered the joys of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, certainly don't start with this one, but make sure you come back to it 18 movies later. It's worth the wait.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

The Captain ridiculed their American hips, and when he were attached to the person who wanted to catch him in the elevator and said ""Hooray for Hydra "", people who understand were happy.

","Entry number 19 in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), all roads have been leading to Infinity War since a Thanos-teasing end credits stinger in 2012's The Avengers (and more broadly since Iron Man kicked it all off in 2008). With Thanos (Brolin) the biggest and baddest threat Earth's mightiest heroes have had to face - and many of the franchise's original stars at the finishing line of lucrative multi-film contracts - the stakes are higher than ever. Even the most popular MCU icons are in life-threatening danger this time around. In the unenviable position of juggling over 20 established characters in a satisfying manner, whilst also delivering the high-end action expected from this series, directors Joe and Anthony Russo get a lot right. Two and a half hours allows for a plethora of mammoth set pieces and the Russos don't hold back. The choreography isn't the most stylish (nor the CGI as polished as it should be), but every dollar of the considerable budget is utilised to craft wall-to-wall action. An exciting first-act sequence teaming up Dr Strange (Cumberbatch), Iron Man (Downey Jr), Spider-Man (Holland) and Bruce Banner (Ruffalo) quickly sets the all-or-nothing tone, but also demonstrates just how difficult the balancing act will be across the lengthy runtime. Whilst Iron Man gets an electrifying entrance (arguably the best moment of the whole movie), Strange never gets to show off his coolest trick, use of the mirror dimension. And where Spidey gets a suit upgrade, Banner gets underwhelming assistance from the Hulk. These trade-offs are littered throughout, with some more egregious (Clint?) than others; however, the narrative pace is so lightning fast that a few character absences or minimisations become more of a concern after the credits have rolled. Where the filmmaking brothers really strike gold is in the barb-heavy dealings between our favourite heroes. Thor (Hemsworth) and Star-Lord (Pratt) are hilarious in their one-upmanship, Strange and Iron Man build a bromance through witty insults, and Black Widow (Johansson), Scarlett Witch (Olsen) and Okoye (Gurira) combine for one scene that tantalises the oft-rumoured all-female Avenger flick. It is a shame though, that whilst Thanos is given the time and dedication to be fleshed out as one of the better villains of the series, his four hench-creatures are visually bland and narratively unnecessary, their design and execution reminiscent of Steppenwolf in Justice League. Although it doesn't break through into the very top echelon of MCU outings, it's not far off either; a few sneaky cameos, consistently delightful character interactions and one of the franchise's best climaxes ensures Infinity War is an immense crowd-pleaser.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","The movie has many different storylines for different heroes and by the middle of the movie I kind of got lost why is everyone doing what they are doing. In Avengers 2 there were many storylines as well, but somehow they managed to make it more interesting there. 
The movie started really well, it was cool to see dramatic moments when everyone was shocked that Thanos is coming, especially meeting with Mark Ruffalo and Tony Stark, but then that dramatism pretty much disappeared.
Also, this movie is very unrealistic even for a Marvel movie. I mean, wtf is with Iron Man suit, it can do literally anything now. Also Spiderman's multiple spider legs also are quite unrealistic, how can he move them like that? Also, Thanos didn't look as powerful as he is supposed to be. He got many different stones, but he was still vulnerable to the Avengers, but he is supposed to be pretty much invincible, he should just crush them, but avengers seemed invincible instead. Also each stone has it's own role and ability, but Marvel didn't really use it that much.
Also, some actors, such as Tom Holland (Spider Man) allegedly dies, but we already know that he has a contract for 3 more Marvel movies, so it was not dramatic for me at all, because it means everyone who died will somehow return.
This is the first movie ever that I have watch at 4DX theater and it was amazing experience. Unfortunately, something was just lacking in the story, thus I give it an 8.

One week before the movie is released in my country, there are many spoilers, but the movie is still interesting to be watched. The main story of the movie is quite simple, there is a common enemy named Thanos, who wanted to become the greatest god ever in the universe. The first plot is already beginning with a war between the good and the bad, and how the relationship between Avengers team is united easily. Yes, because they face the one and only enemy. In this game, I am quite supporter for Thanos, look at him, he is on war alone with Avengers team. The Director is really genius to use all special effects and other things that made this movie a great superhero series. I hope there is the continuity of the plots, because it has in unexplained ending for me. Even though there is post-credit scene, yet the final war is infinity, well maybe this is the meaning for the title ""Infinity"". In other superhero movies, we could guess that the main evil will be dead or failed, but here in Avengers: Infinity War, the happy ending lovers will be disappointed a lot.

","This is the most intense, complex, and stirring Marvel Cinematic Universe film yet -- though the sheer number of characters and storylines make it a bit confusing for anyone who's not a hard-core fan. Avengers: Infinity War is also the grimmest MCU movie so far, with consequences unlike any that have come before in this massive franchise. Much of the talk about the film will centre on those events (no more details here, to avoid spoilers), but there's more to it than that. Directors Joe and Anthony Russo and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely were already responsible for two of the best MCU entries to date, Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War. With Avengers: Infinity War, they continue to respect viewers' intelligence while giving their characters deep motivations and presenting knockout action scenes. It's as lean as epics get; none of its nearly two-and-a-half-hour running time feels wasted. While the many characters and intersecting plots may confuse casual viewers -- the filmmakers assume audiences are familiar with all that's come before -- for fans, it's one mind-blowing moment after another, starting with a jaw-dropping fight in the first minutes. Plus, Infinity War is also one of the funniest MCU movies yet, relying on character-based humour rather than some of the wacky flights of fancy of, say, the also excellent Thor: Ragnarok.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","Despite all the hype I didn't expect much from this movie - I was not a fan of Thor: Ragnarok, and the amount of the characters that were to appear in this film has made me a bit concerned. But as it turned out, I had nothing to worry about.
The film was a pleasant mixture of action, tragedy, and comic relief, as all the different characters interacted with each other. The screenwriters did a great job at blending more serious universes (Captain America, Iron Man) with the humorous ones (Thor, Spider-Man, The Guardians of Galaxy), and they managed to keep them at balance throughout the whole film. Still, despite all this, their focus was put on Thanos, and they found time to explain his actions and motivation - so much needed in a character like this. Marvel has a reputation for not having believable villains, but Thanos, as well as Loki, proved this wrong.
As for the actors, Chris Pratt showed he is the certified king of comedy, Zoe Saldana surprised by bringing out Gamora's sensitive site, and Josh Brolin as Thanos was just mesmerizing. Robert Downey Jr demonstrated his passion for acting and ability to blend with a role of Tony, bringing to it both seriousness and humor (you could really see he is the heart of the MCU, in this movie in particular). And Benedict Cumberbatch can act out just about anything. 
Marvel once again proved that these films are not only made for fans, but also by them- while watching the movie I could feel the excitement and dedication of producers as well as the rest of the crew, and it made me feel grateful, like I was also a part of the journey.

","Before you move on this review contains spoilers.
.
Okay, this movie, by far, is one of the best movies from the MCU. It has a very decent fighting choreography, the acting is really good (surprisingly) and the plot unfolds with style. no long talking sequences to explain what is going on and no advanced computers/weapons to save the day (as is the case with most of the MCU movies). However, this movie might come as a disappointment when the upcoming movies are revealed. since Marvel won't really kill more than half their characters just like that, there IS a way to bring them back. I felt happy that Marvel actually found the courage to kill some of its characters (happy that things finally got serious, but not happy that the character died), but then, in that post-credit scene, I felt a little disappointment. that scene indicates that some hero (Captain Marvel) is comming to save the day. and given the announced future MCU movies (they shouldn't have announced them too soon, they made things too obvious) which includes some of the characters who died in infinity war, all clues says that they will come back. whether they will come back from the dead, some other hidden dimension thing, I'm still not sure. Also, try to separate between the people who died during the movie and the people who died in the end. During the movie, Loki, Heimdall, and Gamora have died due to natural causes. Unlike the others, who died due to some super powers from the infinity gauntlet carrying the six stones. so there is a fair chance that most of these characters will return.
But let's not cloud our judgement by the upcoming movies. Infinity war, on its own, is a great film. But I think it is about time Marvel dropped the super technology mumbo jumbo they always fall back too as a Deus-Ex Machina when the situation gets too dire. And I really want them to get rid of Natasha Romanoff, her ability to fight super strength villians and withstand explosions and strong impacts while she has no powers at all is seriously ridiculous.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

This is definitely the best film of 2018! After watching it 4 times, and still seeing new elements to the complex storyline, I can honestly say that this is the best Marvel movie to date, and I can't wait to see Avengers: Endgame later this year. The action scenes, especially towards the end, are amazing and the magnificent cast all put in great performances. Although the superheroes were under so much pressure to stop the evil Thanos, I still found the witty scenes quite funny, and the CGI was totally on point. The emotional ending, and touching Gamora storyline was a great addition to this spectacular film, which has left the public questioning what will happen next. The director did a good job by not making the plot overcomplicated, even though most of the Marvel Universe were involved, but I would have liked to have seen the Hulk, who was brilliant in Ragnarok. Anyway, this movie sees the evil Thanos, killing everyone who gets in his way to get the 6 Infinity stones, which will give him the ultimate power to bring balance to the Universe. He believes that the universe will soon collapse because of the overpopulation of the intelligent species. He in his insane way had developed a possible solution to this problem: reduce the population by half so that the existing pressure on the resources will automatically reduce. He doesn't strive to eliminate the life form, rather he aims for wiping half of them randomly so that he can create a balance between intelligent life form and resources. To achieve his goal he needs 6 stones in his gauntlet, which include the Space stone, held by Loki, the Mind Stone, which is in Vision, the Reality Stone, which was given to the collector, The Power Stone, which is on Xander with the Nova Corp, The Time Stone which is held by Dr. Strange and the Soul Stone which is in Vormir held by the Red Skull. The superheroes from the Marvel Universe gather to stop Thanos causing mass destruction, but the more stones he gathers is the more power he gains. That's a quick rundown of the storyline, but believe me, it's very complex. When the superheroes gather in Wakanda to stop Thanos from getting the final stone, which is the Mind Stone, the epic final battle ends in disaster, which is why fans are speculating about the outcome. I must admit, when I first watched the movie in the cinema, the ending baffled me, but after talking to a few die-hard fans, I knew that all was not what it seems. With that aside, the directors have kept the next instalment close to there chest, so anything can happen. I just hope that it's in the same class as this movie because it's hard to find a fault with it. They even toned down Spider-Man, who did get on my nerves in his standalone movie, and they gave everyone an equal amount of screen time, even though there were big names in the cast. Anyway, I think you can tell that I thought this movie was great, and I can see myself watching it many more times. Great!",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","Last night I went to the cinema to watch ""Infinity War"" and I wasn't thrilled at all. I'm aware that it's partly my fault, but anyway I think it's extremely overrated. Seen by itself, the film is completely meaningless, because this is not a stand-alone film, but the grand finale of all Marvel films that precede it. So, it's not just recommended that you have seen most of Marvel films before, but it's absolutely necessary that you have seen them all and that they are fresh in your memory. I watched most of Marvel films, but some of them I skipped, and many of those I did see I saw too long ago to remember them, so ""Infinity War"" left me with the impression of a bunch of amazingly shot, but empty action scenes, without the story that gives this action a meaning. It's like if you watched the last hour of ""The Return of the King"", without previously watching the rest of the trilogy or reading ""The Lord of the Rings"" ever before. Most movies have a part that introduces you to characters, then introduces them into a story, then develops and elaborates the story, and ultimately takes you through the blow-away finale. This whole movie is one huge finale, while all the other elements that you need to experience this finale right way need to be found in other Marvel films. Each of the previous films brings new characters, introduces you to them and connects them to the characters from the previous films, builds their mutual relationships and portrays small parts of the big picture, and then ""Infinity War"" puts all these characters together and, assuming you already know who they are, what their relationships are and what was happening in their individual stories, it immediately cast you right into two and a half hour of action madness, without any characterization and explanations, and with a minimum of the story that serves just to separate the action scenes. Marvel films are a literally series in which the episodes are somewhat independent, and this is the last episode, and do not even try to watch it if you didn't follow entire series. Although visually excellent, to me ""Infinity War"" was terribly confusing and even boring, and I will refrain from rating it until I see all the movies that precede him, and then repeat it with good background.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","Ever since the massively successful experiment in shared universe building that was the original Avengers, it has felt somewhat like Marvel have been cruising along at the same level. Although there have been plenty of excellent films in the meantime, nothing has really matched the relative scope and ambition of that first Avengers film, best encapsulated by the somewhat disappointingly formulaic Age of Ultron. 
Infinity War feels like that game changer, and Marvel upping a gear, showcasing a level of ambition in terms of scope of story and characters only seen before in adaptations of epic fantasy such as Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, in fact several times the film put me in mind of Return of the King. In terms of what is a purely cinematic narrative (based of course on decades of comics) the sheer scale of the film is surely unique. 
Despite a run time of two hours forty minutes, the film rarely drags due to a break neck pace that never lets up, there is none of the dull opening exposition and set up that often hurts these films. On the down side, this is likely to leave those who aren't caught up on the series somewhat lost, while it is not essential to have seen every single Marvel film, it is probably important to have seen a large proportion of them.
It also finally feels like Marvel has overcome it 'Villain Problem', similar to the success of Michael B Jordan's character in Black Panther, Josh Brolin's Thanos is an excellent antagonist, with tangible motives and an engaging presence. 
What is perhaps most remarkable about the film is that, it manages its large cast so effectively, not a single moment is wasted and all major characters have their moment to shine, all thanks to the incredibly efficient pacing and stucture. 
Infinity War feels like the best film it could be. The vast scope means that it is impossible for it to quite engage on the same level as the more 'low key' solo entries in the genre, and the necessities of the fast pacing make it exhausting watching at times. Ultimately though, the film is a wild ride and emotional roller-coaster that is not to be missed for fans of the franchise.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","The Marvel films are not high art, nor are they great entertainment, but they're fun for what they are: cheesy, brainless action fests with some shallow character development to make them feel like they have at least some microscopic depth. I love them, but I'm not under any delusion that they're something wonderful.
This film is even further from wonderful than the series has offered so far. The plot is piled high with so many concurrent stories, they all come out as underdeveloped. If you want just a hodge podge of fights and shooting, you'll love this, but there isn't much else going on, at all, and even that aspect of it is disappointing. At a certain point in the film, random Marvel characters just start showing up out of nowhere, as if they'd given up on creating a reason for them to be there.
The worst part of the movie is the ridiculous monster Thanos. He's unoriginal, uninteresting, and the animation of his absurd face, body, and clothing are so obviously fake, I felt like I was watching a cartoon whenever he was on screen. I didn't like him when I first saw him in Guardians: I thought he was a silly, cartoonish monster bad guy, and I was greatly disappointed that he headlined this film. Unfortunately, the goofy, kid-bate aspects of movies like Guardians and Ant Man have taken over the entire franchise because otherwise, they would have written a more interesting antagonist for this one. And what's with the beard, or the wrinkles that look like a beard; just another example of how silly Thanos is as a character.
Be warned if you haven't seen this one: it's got a ""sad"" and rather abrupt ending. I admire them for trying to break the standard a bit, but it felt forced and unfinished because, I'd guess, the writers aren't used to having such an ending for such a film.

The build up is well of 10 years really pays off except that it seems that the tension and the build up had died down after civil war. This is not really a problem with the movie its self, but going forward we already have movies announced for ""dead"" characters. And from the moment I watched it for the first time I can agree that it will be undone. Upon re watch there was ) emotional weight to that scene when there should be. When it is most likely undone in the next movie it will be making that scene almost pointless. Though it is a great movie that lived up to the hype they had the story lines from other movies continued through other movies. The action was great and almost everything else.

","I am superheroes and sci-fi fan. I have watched every single Marvel superhero movies. I found the previous ones especially the old ones like Iron man 1-3, Captain America and Thor series well-designed in story-line and also logical. But Infinity War is nothing like one of those. It felt rushed together and senseless. Each hero just ""feed"" themselves to Thanos one by one after showing off their coolest abilities. Loki as a trickster decided to go one on one face to face with Thanos. You can argue that he tried his best and didnt wanna go quietly into the night. Its heroic but also foolish and it 's simply not something loki would do in my opinion. The war happened in Wakanda. The people mastered laser surgery on infinity stone and the best shield barrier technology i have ever seen but still use spears as their main weapon. The war scene looked a lot like one of the star war movies. And the best part is they decided to open the barrier to protect Vision for his laser surgery, which didnt work at all btw. Well, if you know its Vision they are after, why dont you put the barrier around him instead of forcing to open the barrier. And where were the air support? It looks a lot cooler to go melee against melee with aliens. My dear Winter Soldier is completely useless in this movie even though he got his arm back but only knows how to shoot with M4 and keep getting one-shotted. Why not cast Ant-man instead then? Why wasting precious scene on him just because his buddy is symbol of USA? Not to mention, when Thanos at his weakest, Peter Quill who is so-called guardian of the galaxy paid no attention with the gloves which contains the most important objects in the Universe and key to winning the war but focusing on asking where his girlfriend is and wake up Thanos, who was under control of his teammates. How dare you ask ""did we lose""? Its so ironic that Thor who had millions of combat in him 1500 year of life decided to aim his newly-made axe to the chest of Thanos. I mean did you see the shining armor he's wearing? Can you please cut his hand off or ""go for the head"" or play around with your teammates and not showing off with your weapon at last after teammates are down and lose the war.

There were a few funny moments, and the characters had equal and balanced amounts of screen time. However, that's where any positive comments I could make about this movie end. Every plot line that had been built in the last phase of movies was destroyed in the first 20 minutes of the movie. Some of the romantic subplots seemed to come out of nowhere or at the very least lacked significant, on-screen build up. One of the worst things about the movie was how easy it was for Thanos to find the infinity stones. It was so easy to collect them, anyone could have done it. Thanos could have done it ages ago. Why wait for something that was so simply accomplished? From what the movie shows us, he finds them in a matter of days, with only one stone posing any real challenge to find. Thanos also lacks real motivation as a character. He doesn't desire any acknowledgment, any material possession, or any power for wiping out half the universe. It felt like something pivotal to the story had been removed (which, from my understanding of the comics, was actually the case). It also seemed pretty convenient that at the end of the movie, the heroes left standing were the same boring, dried up characters whose stories were long over before this movie (looking at you, Iron Man).

","Thanos was great as villain (his motives, not so much), the action scenes were good, I liked most of the character interactions, there were some emotional scenes that were done well, and a few things will transpire that you won't see coming, which was very exciting. A lot of the humor was contrived; some of those emotional/dramatic scenes were ruined by poorly timed jokes, something that Ragnarok and GotGv2 suffered from immensely. Way too overcrowded with so many heroes and not enough characters development. The plot is good but it's a mess. Doctor strange was a great addition to avengers movie but not with star lord and his crews. Overall it is a forgetable movie as it has absolutley no impact for the MCU.

","Infinity War manages to be coherent despite the over-abundance of characters. It seemed hard, but somehow all the heroes (or almost all) have their role. 
And while I find the fact that most of the other MCU films are required material to watch this one disagreeable, it does feel like an appropriate culmination of all the previous adventures.
The action is of course great, the stakes higher than ever, and the humour really good, especially among the Guardians of the Galaxy. There are of course glaring weaknesses in the plot - 6 super magical stones that control the entire universe are all just around the corner. Starlord can't control himself for half a second till they remove Thanos' super-glove. But let's face it, it's a superhero film, and a self-aware one at that: when Iron Man explains ""he is from space, here to steal a necklace from a wizard"", you can't complain for such details. It is telling to the film's success how Thanos manages to come off as a genuinely thoughtful and not-entirely-evil villain, even though his philosophy is entirely stupid: he has diagnosed the entire universe's problem to be overpopulation, and thinks killing half of all life (no other measures) will fix everything, because apparently reproduction isn't a thing.

","When I say best, I mean the most emotionally involved, best action, and true ""villain"" of any of the MCU yet. Brolin's Thanos is the definition of what a Villian is. From the very first second of the movie, to the final fade away, you literally dread the next moment. Sure, there's the typical MCU comedy bits in it to keep you from having a nervous breakdown throughout the movie....but Thanos, is ominous to say the least. The bad part is, even though you want him to lose, there's a reasoning behind his madness, albeit misplaced. He even weeps at one point, and you find yourself wanting to feel for him. It's a hate/love relationship. The massive ensemble of the Avengers team we love has grown to massive proportions, although spread apart. They are emotionally tested every single step of the way in this movie, and the viewer is tested along with them. You sit there trying to make the right choice with them, however hard that may be. Do the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few....or the one? Just one of the questions pressed upon our mighty heroes throughout the film. But excruciating to feel as they ponder the question with only moments to decide each time. Anyone who doesn't rate this movie at least a 9 has no concept of what these 10 years of the MCU have been building up to.

","I just want to say what the Russo brothers have done is outstanding. Taking a film with such a crowded cast and as a result; a very crowded story. However, I don't consider that a flaw, but nevertheless a roadblock surely. I believe they have made the best movie that they or anyone else could have done. The film felt equally leveled out, giving each character is given their own individual moments to shine. Everyone brings it in the performances, not a single weak link among them. And for once Marvel seems to finally be nailing their villains. They showed it in Black Panther, and they show it here as well. But who's better Killmonger or Thanos? It all comes down to personal preference, but personally it's hard to say in that they are two completely different characters, they both strive for separate goals due to separate motivations. Killmonger's story felt sort of Shakespearean, while Thanos felt more traditional but still very compelling in its execution. Ultimately this film lets the villain be the star, but like I said before it gives the other characters moments to shine. The action is as good as any Marvel film up to this point, along with fluctuating emotions throughout. Overall, everything that Marvel has done seems to have come to fruition and really paid off.

Film review 
By Nelson Nantanapibul
Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo
Starring: Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, Chris Pratt, Josh Brolin...
 The MCU as it's known is 10 years old and has achieved massive financial and critical success which has culminated in the mother of all crossover events in Avengers: Infinity War. Now even though I admire the MCU and what it has accomplished (at least for me) not every film has hit it out of the park story wise and yet most of their films across the board seem to garner near identical critical praise with some rare exceptions. I loved the first Avengers film and saw it eight times in theaters during its original theatrical run. Age of Ultron fell far short of my expectations and in my opinion was their first major misstep narratively and yet that film still made over a billion dollars worldwide and appeared to be critic proof.
 Then Civil War came along helmed by the Russo Bros and and though it was billed as a Captain America film it was essentially The Avengers 2.5. I'm guessing that was a trial run for the Russos to see if they were worthy of taking over the next major chapter in the Avengers saga and they do not disappoint. 
 Infinity War has the emotional depth that I find lacking in the majority of MCU films and they give us a villain in Thanos who is not only worthy enough to face off against earth's mightiest heroes but is the centerpiece of this film. This is his story all the way through with our heroes serving as the supporting cast. Most MCU villains are completely lackluster and quite frankly have not been all that interesting save for a few such as Loki, Red Skull and the Vulture. 
 Thanos is billed as ""The Mad Titan"" in the comics but in Josh Brolin's performance he comes off as anything but. There is a method to Thanos' madness in the film and he (at least in his own mind) is the hero of this epic story. The best villains in cinema and literature are the ones who do not act purely out of evil intent but who feel as if what they are doing is just and cause and cannot understand why others cannot see things as they do. 
 Thanos has a twisted sense of love and loyalty but he does possess those emotions and they are in full display in this film. Thanos is a fully realized character and has an arc in this film usually reserved for the heroes of the MCU. The Russos have taken the template of the MCU films which had started to become predictable and bland (at least for me) and completely do their own thing under the watchful eye of Kevin Feige to be sure. 
This film is full of surprises and doesn't always go the way viewers expect it to and in one instance they kind of psyche you out in thinking one thing will happen and pull the rug out from under you. I cannot elaborate without spoiling what the scene is but it definitely had the audience at my screening audibly gasp out loud. For the first time in a long time I have actually felt like there were actual stakes in an MCU film where just about anything could happen and they set up those expectations from the get go. The Russos do not waste time in getting us into the action and they stomp their foot on the gas up until the very end. 
This film had the usual brand of MCU style humor but didn't overstaurate the viewers with it the way I feel other films in the universe have begun to overly rely on it in lieu of character and plot development. The film also has great emotional depth and resonance that I have not felt within the MCU for a very long time. There were some moments in the film where I thought, I can't believe they actually went there. There was only one time in the film where I felt that they played it safe in terms of the fate of a character where if they had followed through on it would have really thrown viewers for a loop.
Marvel has delivered something amazing with this film. The MCU could go in any direction from here on out. Actually if this were to be the last film in the MCU franchise (it's not) it would be a satisfying if somewhat dark and dreary way to end things but it could end. I highly recommend this film and what has been accomplished by the Fiege braintrust is nothing short of amazing and (almost) unheard of. The shared cinematic universe is not a new concept but it has not been accomplished on a scale of this size and it has yet to be successfully emulated by other studios. Definitely see this film and see how seamlessly the Russos intertwine so many characters together with Thanos serving as the thread that ties everything together from one scene to the next.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

Never has there been such an assemblage of notables in one film, and never it seems has one film taken so much money at the box office in its first weekend. Let's face it, this is not just one film""......it's taken us ten years to get here, ten years of Marvel wowing us with good, not so good and fairly awesome film, ten years to introduce us to all their heroes and villains and I have to say, if you're going to put them all in one film......this is surely the way to do it. Some of our early heroes are ageing but what's a little make up between friends and well hey it blinkin works. This film is not a single story, it's a gathering of many tales told in many different ways, with all paths heading on a collision course. I can't tell anything of the plot without massive spoilers but what I can say is, it's great meeting all the characters again, spending a couple of minutes fitting their individual pieces into one massive jigsaw as you remember what their role is in the story, and another thing, it made me want to go back and watch all the other films again. This is a film you'll want to watch again and again I'm sure........oh and people....it's Marvel, stay until the end of the credits!!!!",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

1251,4 May 2018,jessup-86446,7," Thanos is the best villain in years, but... MAJOR SPOILERS
","Thanos surprised me with his range, he isn't just the big bad, there is some genuine pathos here and Josh Brolin is fantastic here.
Pretty much the movie was going great until they went to Wakanda, where the last half hour or so of the film really fell flat for me. I would've liked to have seen the big battle take place somewhere real, a real world city, not a magic city I don't care about, might as well have been in Kun Lun.
I would also like to have seen more shots of what Thanos did with that last fatal snap, not just to the heroes and to that one street in New York after the credits, but across the planet and even the universe at large. Trillions died, but it felt more like dozens, there should have been something like when Ego tried to do the same thing with his blobby plant things in Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2, where you see Xandar and Eath and other crazy planets getting messed up. I realize that this is movie is part one of two, but it still needs to stand alone, and the consequences of the most significant finger snapping in comic book history should have been overwhelmingly displayed.
Additionally, I'm afraid that Marvel has overplayed their hand here. I expected a bloodbath but there is no way they will leave THIS half of their heroes dead, as I should point out that most of the ones that kicked it were NEW to the universe (Really? You expect me to believe SPIDERMAN, Black Panther, and Doctor Strange are all dead after only one movie each?? (Not to mention almost the entire cast of GoG)
As such you can't take the consequences seriously, which detracts from the narrative, in particular the death of Gamora, which at the time was a tear jerker and really shone the light on Thanos' humanity.
Now I feel like they will just bring her back with the rest somehow in the second movie. Boo.
And just to nitpick, the new Iron-Man suit is stupid, Iron-Man has always been a heavy hitter because of how SOLID he is, so suddenly replacing his suit with nano-particle Transforers 4 bullcrap was just awful.
Sadly, Thor's axe also ends up kind of sucking; as far as names go ""Mjolnir"" is far better than the generic ""Stormbreaker"" and in terms of appearance, the wooden handle is just too big and cartoonish, though I loved that Groot made it for him.
In the end, while the film was not a brutal disappointment as I feared, it is still a disappointment.

1258,29 April 2018,vinniec-53536,10," The Greatest Comic Book Movie of All Time
","'Avengers: Infinity War' is a film 10 years in the making. Marvel Studios has been building to this since the first 'Iron Man' back in 2008, and it is more than worth the wait. Infinity War has everything you could want in a film of this scale: mind-blowing action, gut-busting humor, extremely satisfying character interactions, a terrifying villain you can kind of sympathize with, and a few truly heartbreaking moments. The film's directors, the Russo brothers, manage to fit all of this into a nearly 3 hour movie and still have it flow perfectly from one scene to the next. The pacing is fantastic for the amount of major characters in one movie. It never felt slow or boring and kept my eyes glued to the screen. The action scenes are the best I've ever seen in a superhero movie. It was like watching a comic book come to life. Seeing the different heroes fight alongside each other was incredible, and every character has a moment to shine. Infinity War marked the first crossover between the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy, and their various interactions were everything I ever wanted them to be. The humor was hilarious, yet never felt out-of-place. The scenes that needed to be serious were exactly as they should have been. The film's villain, Thanos (portrayed brilliantly by Josh Brolin), is without a doubt the Marvel Cinematic Universe's best and most interesting antagonist to date. He commanded the screen and stole every scene he was in. He is also by far the most real looking CGI character I have ever seen. Unfortunately, he is responsible for pretty much all of the heartbreaking moments I mentioned earlier. If you think this is just another happy, bright Marvel movie, you are sorely mistaken. This is a war, and not everyone makes it out alive. My advice? Bring tissues. Lots and lots of tissues. As for standout performances, there are a few. Josh Brolin (Thanos), Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Elizabeth Olsen (Scarlet Witch), and Zoe Saldana (Gamora) all had major roles in the film and their acting was on point. In conclusion, 'Avengers: Infinity War' is not only the best Marvel movie to date, it is the greatest comic book movie of all time.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

However, whenever a film branches out from the standard MCU template, such as the X-Men films or Into the Spiderverse, it can be really good. This movie was special in that is was a part of the mainline MCU series, and still managed to do something completely different from what audiences are used to. And not only was this branching out, it also tied together over twenty movies and provided an excellent climax to the overarching plotline of Thanos and the Infinity Stones. While I have mixed feelings about Endgame, which serves as the conclusion to the MCU Infinity Stones Saga, this film is the climax, and is executed in a nearly flawless way.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

1285,8 May 2018,MackMonMay87,9," Latest MCU Flick a Gem in Marvel's Gauntlet
","It's a general rule that if you invest more time into something, the more you'll get out of it. This could apply to studying, cooking, maybe a good solid nap, or a good video game. The Marvel Cinematic Universe is no exception. Anyone who knows me even in a casual sense can tell you I'm pretty into Marvel Comics. I can still remember all the way back to the early 90's (all the way back, because, I guess it was a long time ago now) when it was a combination of friend's comics, a few select arcade games, and those awesome trading cards that had character stats on them that first infected me with the Marvel bug. I remember seeing that art and the style, and what the characters represented, and what really blew my mind as a youngling was when I realized that not only were these characters incredible, amazing, and mighty in their own right, but that they knew each other! These guys are a part of a whole universe!! I think that realization was maybe my first time that I experienced a story with an over-arcing lore. Stuff that was read to me by my parents as a kid, The Little Engine that Could, or Peter Cottontail, didn't feature outlandish team ups where everything was on the line (not that I'd necessarily be opposed to Clifford the Big Red Dog and The Berenstein Bears teaming up to knock the stuffing out of evil aliens). 
I think one of the rewarding parts of a whole universe like Marvel, and their contemporaries, is the sense of reward that the fans feel when they see characters that have their own self-contained franchise and world meet each other and work together. To someone outside of the know, it just looks like a band of superheroes, big deal, right? But to fans, you're seeing characters that have their own harrowed origins, unique powers and motivations, supporting casts, and mythology interact with other characters who are their equals, their peers, and have all of those same elements as well. When you center that kind of team-up around very, very high stakes, like the fate of an entire city, or maybe the world, or possibly, even further, all of the universe and known reality, the excitement and scale of the fictional world that these characters inhabit takes on a whole other level of importance and depth. 
But how do you communicate something like that in a movie, where you have a limited amount of screen time, actors with restrictive schedules, and budgets to balance? I'm sure that for most of film history, something like the Marvel Universe, in its scale and entirety, was considered something strictly for printed, comic book material. You can see in past comic book films that studios that owned the rights to a whole universe of characters never had them meet, never thought of their headliner superheroes meeting each other, and how that would operate. In the past 10 years, Marvel Studios, in conjunction with a few other distributors until they could finance, film, and distribute movies on their own, has become a giant in the entertainment industry, and it's all because of that same idea and concept that drew me to this world when I was in kintergarden. The right minds at Marvel Studios realized that bigger picture, the overall story, was what mattered, and that if it could be communicated properly, would be something that would change superhero storytelling on screen forever. 
We thought that everything had changed back when Avengers first came out in 2012, after about 5 and 1/2 years of build up, and that with the follow ups, things had changed even more, but I can definitively tell you that after Infinity War, there's truly no going back. There's often a lot of talk that the superhero genre is going to burst like a bubble at some point, like Westerns and the macho-action films of the 80's and 90's, which is still possible, but fans of the genre and characters should be grateful that Infinity War has been released before that point. After the great reception and revitalization that the well received Spider-Man: Homecoming and Black Panther movies generated, Marvel couldn't have timed this latest entry any better. 
With this being the 19th overall entry into the series, Infinity War keeps the energy alive in the saga by addressing some of the criticisms that often gets levelled at the MCU by impatient critics and people who might not be as familiar with the overall story: that the stakes aren't high enough, the villains aren't threatening and compelling enough, and that there aren't any consequences for the main characters, that they're insulated and protected to keep the franchise going. One of my main concerns about the MCU since the first Avengers, is that since there's so many moving parts in the saga, how would Thanos be handled and introduced? In the 6 years since he first appeared post-credits, we haven't seen a whole lot of action and development from him as a character. He's a looming background presence, and despite being teased and established in a very basic, general way, we haven't really seen much from him, despite having the opportunity. I'm relieved to be able to say that any worry I had about his authenticity is gone. Thanos is one of the most dynamic, ruthless, yet also fascinating villains in the series and for all of comic book movies yet. Josh Brolin's matter-of-fact and stoic delivery, occasionally dipping into a few surprisingly heartfelt moments, really ties the movie together. The CGI on Thanos captured his expressions, overwhelming power, and menace very well, he blended right in with the cast for me. One could almost say that Infinity War was really about the journey and development of Thanos as a character, and that The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, and the Wakandan tribe are really just obstacles for him that he needs to get past, to accomplish a goal that while sounding insane and vicious, has justification from his point of view. The movie does a great job of taking a character who could so easily be a cardboard cut-out of a villain, evil and cruel just for the sake and fun of it, and makes him into a guy that, yes, while definitely all of that, has a reason for doing what he's doing. It doesn't have to make rational sense, but that his motivations are present and well-illustrated in a few scenes makes him dynamic. Despite how flawed and disgusting they are, even the worst despots from their point of view have some kind of reason for doing what they do, and delivering on that aspect was crucial, and makes Thanos a very engaging villain for us to watch. I now understand that the early movies set the stage for who you thought was going to be a madman of great strength but little character, and then surprised you with a bit more depth once he finally made his anticipated entrance.
I can see why the Russo Brothers were chosen to direct this entry, Joss Whedon brought the team together skillfully in the first installment, but I think his peppy dialouge and lingering on petty conflicts, while perfect for the very first time the team has to work as one, wouldn't have worked for a conflict and story on this scale. The Russo Brothers balanced those inter-personal relationships with a huge, multi-faceted story in Civil War, and were brought back to do the same on a level 10 times bigger than before. (Side note: way to rep for Ohio, boys!!!)I won't talk a whole lot about what I thought of each individual character and actor's performance of them, or the action scenes, the powerful emotional moments, or affects, which are all more or less completely spectacular. Infinity War is long, and this only part 1, and there's just too much to address in this review about all of those topics, this would become a long, long essay. Just know that the huge multitude of relationships are handled well as long as you the viewer know these characters, understand how they fit together, and are able to keep track of what their importance to the overall plot is. I'd be interested in the take of a first-time viewer, who watched the end result of a decade of cinematic storytelling, and wonder if they thought it was worthwhile or not. I can certainly tell you that this experience is mainly for those who've invested the same time and energy into this saga that the creators themselves have, and are arriving at this journey after all this time. 
It's tough for me to view Infinity War as a stand-alone movie, to judge it completely on its own merits, because in my opinion I think that's wrong. I think that's unfair to the design of the story itself, and while I know that there are critics and people out there that will do this (which they're completely valid in doing), it's tough for me to, but I'll try. I do think that it bounces around a lot and the pace can be fast sometimes, but shouldn't it get a pass for this? It has to cram so much into its nearly 3 hour runtime, and even that was split from it being 6 hours with the second part (if anyone from the studio is watching, I would gladly, gladly watch a cinematic re-release of the full cut with intermissions peppered in like they did back in the day). The fast pace and character juggling in a standalone movie without context would be terrible if this were our first time getting to know these characters, but it's not, this movie is a collection of multiple threads that have been established for years, with its own over-arcing narrative thrown in as well. So while I'll take just a few points off for some scenes that I think could've breathed more, or times where I think it brushed past something a bit quickly, again, take that with a grain of salt, because those criticisms come from trying to look at I.F. as its own movie, when really it's a summary of what came before, and I would posit that looking at the movie that way would be the viewer simply digesting the material wrong. I give everyone at Marvel Studios a huge hand for making something for the fans.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","Even with the Russo brothers directing Infinity War, I was never certain a film could work on this scale. So many sci-fi elements, so many characters... it was so far from the grounded film the Russos made before and Marvel was going into even more bombastic territory than GOTG or the Thor films. What would decide if this film could work was going to be its villain and its usage of its characters. I'm happy to say that it succeeded in all fronts. The pacing in this film is quick and impeccable. Every character gets something to do, albeit some more than others. Its villain, Thanos, is likely the MCU's most compelling villain and the core of the film. He is not only intimidating and dread-inducing, but also sympathetic. This film is also incredibly dark with violent deaths, a grave tone, and writing that lacks much hope. This film has an emotional core, shocking themes, and amazing action. The CGI is fabulous, the score is masterful, and the visuals are eye-popping and wonderful.

","Well, this seems as if it was the first Avengers movie where Tony Stark didn't hog the centre of attention. In fact it seems to be pretty evenly spaced between all of the Marvel characters, and with the number that have now come into the franchise, I was wondering how they were going to handle the huge ensemble. Well, it turned out pretty well, though of course when you have so many super heroes all gathered together the bad guy is going to have to be pretty tough, and they outline they quite quickly where he takes down the Hulk.
 This is probably one of those movies that we don't need to say anything about the plot because it has been building up to it for the last ten years, and anyway it is actually based on a comic book series as it is. So, we have this Titan, Thanos (Titan as in an inhabitant of Titan as opposed to one of the old gods from Greek mythology, though Marvel hasn't shied away from borrowing from mythology as it is). He has this plan to depopulate the universe and to do that he needs these stones called Infinity Stones, and when he has all of them he will become invincible. Once again, the movies over the last ten years have been dropping hints as to these stones, and now we have basically come to the climax of that story arc.
 So, the question that is raised, is where to from here. Well, I'm sure the avid comic book readers do have a pretty good idea since there is quite a lot of material that can be borrowed from. However, we also need to remember that this is actually part one of a two part series, so the story isn't over yet. The problem is that with the ending as it is, there isn't all that much room to be able place any movies between the two Avengers movie. However, it seems that we will be seeing Captain Marvel and Ant Man and the Wasp before the grand finale to this Avengers movie.
 Okay, this may be a bit of a spoiler, but then again I have warned you, but characters do die, which is a bit of an oddity because if there is one thing with comic books and that is characters always seem to be able to come back. Well, that seems to be the case with the movies as well because Loki seems have have had some miraculous resurrections. However, I will leave it at that.
 Now Thanos, they certainly have put a lot of effort into creating a villain that works. There are a lot of shallow villains out there, and Thanos certainly isn't one of them. Sure, he has a motive, but it isn't one of those 'I want to conquer the universe' type of motives. In a way he seems to just want a bit of peace and quiet, and the problem is that overpopulation certainly doesn't allow room for that. Sure, he is pretty powerful, and when you are going up against pretty much every single Marvel hero that has appeared to date (with the exception of Ant-Man - he is mysteriously absent in the film), you certainly are going to have to be of a special calibre.
 As for the comedy, well, they certainly have toned it down a lot. It was starting to get to the point where the movies were simply turning into a collection of one liners, particularly with Thor: Ragnarok. However, this wasn't the case here, which did help quite a lot. I do hope they continue along that trend and continue to tone down with it. However, it was a shame that some of the really cool characters from Ragnarok went missing in action as well, but I think the opening scene pretty much explains that.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","A culmination of the first 10 years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's kind of insane of far they've gotten. There isn't any major development on previously established characters in this one. But that's OK since we have 18 other movies where you can get to know everything about them. Thanos is the man who's at the core. It's really good because now the villain isn't sidelined at all. Bold chances are taken, which actually makes you feel the important weight that this movie needed to bring. All in order for it to leave a greater impact and resonance compared to what the MCU has done before. It's a theme park ride, but with real care put into it. It's not merely action and special effects for the sake of it. There's a real humanity at the core of this extravaganza.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018
1320,29 April 2018,timothyalanwilliams,8," Thanos Rules in ""Infinity War""
","The anticipation has been building for years. The ultimate baddie, Thanos, who has remained in the shadows, is coming to earth the get the five Infinity Stones that would give him the power to destroy half of the universe with one snap of his fingers. With the current Avengers disbanded, after the events of ""Age of Ultron"" and ""Civil War"", they weren't exactly prepared for a foe like Thanos. 
To avoid any spoilers, I will leave the plot details at that. 
""Avengers: Infinity War"" really packs a punch. It's relentless action and quick (and often witty) dialogue keep the two and half hour movie rolling without slowing down for you to relax or, at times, really process what just happened. To balance all the Marvel Cinematic Universe characters, and subplots, was a feat in and of itself. I applaud the Russo Brothers (who also directed ""Winter Soldier"" and ""Civil War"") for taking on such a daunting task and succeeding in keeping us engaged while giving the primary Avengers, as well as The Guardians of the Galaxy, their own moments to shine. 
But this movie isn't really their movie. It's all Thanos, played by Josh Brolin buried under CGI to make him look more monster than man. But he finds a way to emote and make his character more than just another big baddie without a soul. 
The movie isn't perfect. There are a few CGI moments, mostly of Thanos, that looked like they needed more time to finish. And it's cliffhanger ending (the untitled ""part two"" will release May of next year) left me feeling numb and somewhat unsatisfied. But be sure to stay for the post-credits scene.

1330,6 May 2018,matthewssilverhammer,9," A Big, Giant, Entertaining Mess...With One of the Boldest Superhero Endings Ever
","Pardon the cliché, but Infinity War is truly an emotional roller coaster. Unlike previous entries in this long-running behemoth of super-people, this ride's ascents and dives come faster and furious-er than Vin Diesel driving a sports car through a skyrise window. And (at the risk of really pushing the metaphor) this coaster's biggest drop comes seconds before you exit the ride, leaving audiences with a sense of ""Woah..."", unlike most other comic book films.
To clarify, this isn't the best MCU film. For one thing, better entries in the series say something outside of themselves. Iron Man touches on the military-industrial complex. Spider-Man deals with modern-day class issues. All the Captain America entries wrestle brilliantly with government overreach. Infinity War is (for better or worse) focused on plot and character. In spots, it lands its punches (Thor's arc, Thanos' brutality, anything Guardians); in others, it misses (initial attack on NYC, Vision & Scarlet Witch love story, anything Cap). It's a gargantuan undertaking, and your investment in the story and forgiveness of its unwieldiness will only goes as far as your predetermined commitment.
If you haven't been keeping up with the franchise (which is essentially a big-budget television show), this is not the episode to jump in on. A 10 years / 18 films / 50+ superheroes bottleneck whose ambition has only been matched by its success. By its very nature, there's only so much you can do to keep this thing from flying off the rails. However, if you're already committed, then the endless barrage of humor and excitement, which crescendos into an unexpected emotional gut-punch, will make for a haunting and bold (though not quite fantastic) Marvel outing.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","I saw ""Avengers:Infinity War"", starring Robert Downey Jr.-The Judge, The Shaggy Dog_2006; Chris Hemsworth-12 Strong, Vacation_2015; Benedict Cumberbatch-Zoolander 2, August:Osage County and Josh Brolin-Only the Brave, Sicario.
This is the best super hero movie that I have ever seen. It is the first part of a two part story-the second part will come out next year, as they were both shot at the same time. This is the 10th anniversary of the Marvel cinematic universe-the first movie being Iron Man in 2008-and I think the 19th movie overall. This one has almost any character you can think of-I read that there is about 64 main characters that show up. Thanos is the villain here, portrayed by Josh in magnificent form. He is after the 6 Infinity stones, incredibly powerful gem stones that when combined, would make him unstoppable. Each gem is in a different location and each has a different power; Space, Mind, Power, Reality, Time and Soul. Benedict is in possession of one, as is the Vision, so you can guess who is coming to town on a hunting spree. Robert and Chris both have their shots at Josh, with little chance of slowing him down. Why does Thanos want these gems so badly? He simply believes the universe is overpopulated-resources, food, etc.-and just wants to cull the herd a bit to make it a better universe for everyone else. He travels across the galaxy destroying about half of a planets population and smiles while he does it. The heroes have to unite in their fight and that's when you see some pretty awesome fights. And there are casualties-you might even say it's a bloodbath. And I'm talking some of the A-listers here. There is the usual Stan Lee cameo-look for him driving a bus full of kids-and there is a scene after the end credits, so don't leave too early-there is another casualty.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, language and crude references and has a running time of 2 hours & 29 minutes.

I loved how this film could just as easily make me laugh with its very well-placed tension-breaking humour as well as make me feel sad or scared for the characters, it awed me a whole lot, I was just consistently entertained by it and I was so impressed by how a film with such ceaseless action and such a vast array of characters could work as well as this does without feeling cluttered or overwhelmingly bloated, but they pulled it off big time, this movie deserves all the success and praise it's getting. I loved how beautifully it brought together and combined the stories of the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy without it for a second feeling off or jarring, or anyone compromising who the were as established characters, if anything seeing characters together that I really never thought I would like Rocket Raccoon and Thor sharing such great and easy chemistry, really opened up and broadened them as characters even more. And how they brought to life and expanded upon the long-teased menace of Thanos was just incredible, instead of being a one-note villain who you just hated, they made him like a troubled almost tragic figure who's twisted vision for a better universe had cost him his soul, you really got that it broke what was left of his heart to sacrifice Gamora. They made Thanos truly epic, he got out of that chair and he brought every bit of that galactic wrath down upon our heroes, I mean you kind of knew that they were completely screwed when the Hulk gets trounced in the opening scene! The cgi looked fantastic too, he had as much presence as anyone in the cast, looking all-but completely real. I loved this, Marvel did not stumble at this critical juncture with the movie house of cards they've been stacking for this past ten years, and this one was a fantastic gem that was well worth the wait, my mind was totally blown!

Not all of the films in this franchise are good, but almost all of them are watchable (at least once). This film was really good, but, like I said above, you really have to put in the work if you want to reap the rewards. If you like the MCU, you already know you're going to see this movie anyways, and you're probably willing to forgive it for most of its flaws. This movie is absolutely worth seeing.

But my worries has come true. would it be enough to put twenty something superheroes including bring together some of them for the first time, telling a lot of jokes (some of them REALLY unfunny and appeared at a bad timing), intorducing the three dimesional character that Thanos possess, some great battle sequence, and then finding the stones, and actually a lot more. well, somehow they managed to push them into 2 and a half hours film, but it felt rushed. the relationship between Thanos and his daughter Gamora felt so plastic even though that is one of the tools for the audience to get to know Thanos better. and a lot more issues. but it;s still a cool and very risky film to make, dozens of stars, more than 3 complex plots filled with different characters that contrast to each others, i still have to give it a props. and the ending is worth waiting btw, really breathtaking.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

Honestly, I felt that the entire Team Cap storyline was the weakest part of this movie. They should've ditched Captain America, Bucky, Black Widow, Falcon and Rhodey like they did Hawkeye and Antman; their absence would've made little difference, and the time wasted on these one-note characters could've instead been used to better flesh out the background that led Thanos to come to his conclusion to wipe out half the universe and also Thanos and Nebula's relationship.

","Despite some slow pacing and a confusing storyline, Avengers Infinity War is the culmination of years of MCU movies and their interlocking storylines, resulting in a movie that features the main villian Thanos killing half of the MCU heroes that have driven the franchise to record heights. Among them, Black Panther, Spiderman, Gamora, and in a post credits sequence, Nick Fury and Maria Hill, calling for Captain Marvel, who will make her screen debut next year in an origin story before she joins the team in Avengers 4, also slated for next year.

The result was a success - the heroes' egos jam up alongside each other beautifully.
Robert Downey Jr is on top form once more, and the Guardians of the Galaxy troop provide welcome comedic relief. Also, Thanos, is the most meaningful and personal antagonist of the series.

","Just got out of Infinity War Part 1 (don't argue, it's true). As someone who doesn't like the MCU... It was ok. It's a movie where each 3rd progressively gets better. The first 3rd (besides the amazing opening) is the worst. It is an utter tonal mess. Anytime the film tried to do anything of meaning or impact they throw in a stupid joke right after it to break the tension. If the whole movie was this way that would be fine but even in the beginning some REALLY dark stuff happens. The second 3rd is a little better as the story picks up speed but if you asked me how the movie was halfway through I'd tell you it's terrible. The final act is where things finally get real and I'm not talking about action. Some really screwed up stuff happens and the tension actually rises. It honestly makes the earlier parts feel pathetic. This film is in dire need of a fan edit. Edit out the jokes and you'd actually have a good film. Some of the characters feel underutilized but that was bound to happen. It honestly doesn't matter though, Thanos is the main character and he is my favorite character from this franchise so far. He's intimidating yet emotional. He's the most morally complex character in the series and he won't be a let down for fans. Infinity War Part 1 is ultimately a hot mess and needs to be edited down to be more serious in the beginning. Luckily the final act grows a pair to save the movie. I'd give it a 7 but the score is too high so I made it a 6 for now.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

Visually it is superb with excellent special effects and settings throughout, and there is the right amount of humour spread across the characters. The plot transitions from the different group of heroes well, and manages to balance the story with the action - the slower, emotional scenes often have the same impact as the large scale and explosive actions scenes. However, the same criticisms of the Marvel series of movies are still there - the heroes are thrown about seemingly to no consequence, the plot just trundles along at times with little respite, and some of the fight scenes are so quick so you can't see the action.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

1427,28 April 2018,neobateman,8," A perfect Blockbuster.
","Avengers: Infinity War is not only the 3rd Avengers film or 19th installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe but also marks the 10 year anniversary since the start of everything MCU with the first Iron Man film. A lot of expectations are put onto this film, this is the film that unites the Avengers with the Guardians of the Galaxy to take down the greatest threat yet, Thanos (Josh Brolin). I will not go too much in depth with the story, only referring to what we saw in the trailers. The cast in this film is absolutely ridiculous, Robert Downey jr, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, Zoe Saldana, Karen Gillan, Tom Hiddleston, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Idris Elba, Peter Dinklage, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow, Benicio Del Toro, Josh Brolin and Chris Pratt. With such a huge cast it will be naturally difficult for the writers and directors to successfully balance all of these characters, giving them enough to do. In most cases it works, in others however I felt that more development was required. A good choice by the filmmakers was the idea to split up these characters all over the universe. They were paired up in smaller groups, this gives the opportunity to bring in some of the classic dynamics that we have come to love and also set up some new conflicts. However what was done with one relatively small group in the first Avengers is done here with multiple groups. This causes some characters to lose their strength in development that made them so interesting in their previous films. This is why I recommend to have seen some of the Marvel films beforehand, otherwise this film won't emotionally move you as you aren't familiar with most of the storylines and characters. One of my biggest worries about Infinity War was Thanos, most other villains in the MCU were boring uninteresting entities that the heroes simply had to face and punch their way out. They were never interesting and there was never a sense where the audience could understand them. Luckily Thanos breaks that tradition, Josh Brolin gives a very conflicted performance of a creature that wants balance in the universe, which is why he wants to collect the infinity stones. The audience receives a motivation, (which I will not spoil) that makes this character understandable and to a degree even relatable. You never root for Thanos but you understand him at the same time. Brolin easily gives us the best MCU villain and one of the strongest comic book villains in years, easily exceeding Tom Hiddleston and Michael B. Jordan. The same thing can unfortunately not be said about the hero characters. Some receive extra material that allows them to shine as the great actors they are, notably Robert Downey jr, who adds the typical eccentric charisma of Tony Stark but there also seems to be sense of terror and panic within his portrayal. Downey jr has now played the genius, playboy, philanthropist for 10 years, it's still awesome to see that this Academy Award nominee puts this amount of effort into a role he has now played for a decade. Zoe Saldana also has some key scenes to really shine, especially when she comes to realize who the attacker is. Gamora has never been my favorite Guardian of the Galaxy. However this is the first time where I find her character interesting. Overall Infinity War is a popcorn spectacle with a great villain and some terrific performances, however the different tones can be jarring sometimes and most other hero characters receive very little development.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","So we have 19 films in the MCU after 10 years we get the the end game in marvel phase 3 
this film has taken about five days to come with a review because of the enormous film it and plot detail and twists not give so much away 
But the story and action has to be given so people know what is happening to everyone in this film 
lets just say its its like an empire strikes back from star wars and lets just say the next one will be 
like return of the Jedi 
This film is a modern classic an epic to beat all epic 
its is 10 out of 10 no fatigue what so ever 
2hrs 29mins and 10 mins for credits with an all important sos to 
the ulitimate hero in a marvel ous universe so not giving plot spoilers just
figure that one out 
this is my biggest written review i have giving 
with 6 stones played out over 19 films
 1 The Space Stone (a.k.a. The Tesseract) this was found in captain america the first avenger all those years ago
The Space Stone gives the user power over space. Anyone holding the Space Stone can create a portal from one part of the universe to another
2The Mind Stone (Loki's scepter) thor .The Mind Stone allows the user to control the minds of others. 
3The Reality Stone (Aether) the purple stone The Reality Stone grants the user power to manipulate matter. comes the second thor movie
4 The Power Stone the guradian of the galaxy The Power Stone bestows upon its holder a lot of energy-the sort of energy that you could use to destroy an entire planet. 
5The Time Stone (Eye of Agomoto)The Time Stone grants its owner the power to re-wind or fast-forward time this is seen in doctor strange
6The Soul Stone Basically the Soul Stone allows the user to control others ""souls,"" both living and dead rumoured to be in Wakanda
this is iron mans 30 iron man suit out of 46 comic creations wow
Thanod has no conscience so His motivations feel somewhat morally ambiguous and at times even make him seem sympathetic. 
Directors Anthony and Joe Russo do a superb job developing Thanos' personality outside of simply wanting universal dominationas he has emerged from the universal shadows
thanos is a despot looking for power and his time in the sunset
 With the Q ship in New York this destroys New York as thanos hench men come looking for the stones
ebany ma and friend come after the strange with iron man and his protege spider iron man
so we get this iron man gets onto this Q-space ship and head off to titan with wity popular one liners to help and pop culture to refernce 
We see all the story take place in space with guardians after they gettting a distress beacon space and find a planet destoryed and a thor in distress
without his trusty item but finds but finds Nidavellir,but has to restart a planets dangerous engine 
where they and Eitri create an enchanted battle-axe known as Stormbreaker this might or might not be the key
there we see all the hero's story vision just happens to be in Scotland to trying to stay out of the spotlight with scarlett witch
they come under and attack but captain america , the black widown and falcon rescue him this all leads to wakanda. 
I did not see the film black panter but the higlight of the film is the nearly the main event and battle with the soundstrack from avengers ringing out
when the q ships come and the alien shape shifters called Chitauri attack wakanda and we see an all out battle with the fortress under an attack 
we 6 heroes here doing shock and awe explosions 
bruce and the hulk have a fun time her but they have issues and may need therapy fun or what in the heat of battle 
he has a lend of a machine but in space groot has handle on things he is central to a comeback in the heat of battle 
Two years after the events of Captain America: Civil War, the Avengers team remain a fractured group of heroes,
 with some completely dropping off the radar altogether. However, one day, the powerful intergalactic tyrant Thanos (Josh Brolin
) arrives on Earth to complete his collection of Infinity Stones, which upon acquiring all six, will allow him to control half of the known universe. With time quickly running out, 
The Avengers must reunite and team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy to put an end to Thanos' unquenchable thirst for power.
so we have 6 stone from all over the universe a rampaging thanos is the ulitimat vllian 
his home of titan has been destroyed 
while this is going iron man spider iron man and doctor strange and Peter Quill / Star-Lord trying to fight thanos on his home planet
this is the critical moment in the story and brilliant set peices and some film's darker tone, there are still some hilarious scenes of bante
so with the avengers broke up there split in seperat battles across space and several stars planets 
so with thanos proving that no challenge is left unturned no love can change his path of destiny 
vormir is where thanos given the choice he choses death over life with a heartbreaking moral to his story
with so much at stake he must just leave his gurard down but with a mass extinction on superhero scale
but an old leader has the power he pages a hero calling to the heavens can one person answer that call or has fight gone for ever

Yes I get that in real life people use humor to deal with tragic situations such as at a funeral but I don't need a ""witty quip"" in the middle of a fight to the death. It takes you out of it and makes it seem like the moment isn't as significant. The last fight at Wakanda was dope though I have to give it credit there. It also had a pretty intriguing end that made me want to throw on the next one so it did something good there for sure. The enormity of the situation was actually felt there and I'm intrigued to see it end.

It seems Thanos is the only one who realizes that there are too many people and is actually doing something about it. No that I have that off my chest, what about the movie? 
As with the rest of the Marvel Universe films, there is no shortage of action and all your favorite characters are there. In that respect it feels like Pasta Puttanesca: You throw in whatever you have in the cupboard. And, for those of us who have not been totally sucked into the storyline, CNN has produced a good summary and timeline to help decipher the nuanced hints of what was to come in Infinity Wars. 
The writers have done a good job of interweaving the various storylines together, no mean feat, to keep those who, such as myself, have not followed the story arc over the pat 10 years. Visuals, as yo would expect are stunning, and the hand-held photography is kept to a minimum so as not to induce vertigo!
Infinity Wars certainly raises some major questions about what is to come. I mean how can you eliminate that many key figures and keep the franchise alive? But then, Thanos does have the time infinity stone, so who is to say that time won't be reversed. After all this is fantasy.

","A fantastic sequel and one of the finest of the MCU. It was not perfect but it was hell of a fun film with more twists than all those films combined. I think it was a very challenging task to bring all these characters together but it worked. I really loved the new combinations and relationships of the different characters which were incredibly dynamic. Also the portray of Thanos was fantastic. Sure they could have worked a little more on the effects but he way the character was written was excellent and extremely unexpected because it was not the kind of one dimensional and boring villain I would have expected. They really gave him a lot of soul and possibly more than any of the other characters with the exception of Zoe Saldana's Gamora, which marks Saldana's best turn with that character. Robert Downey Jr. was his usual self but more fun than in this latest Tony Stark appearances. Chris Evans was rather boring. Chris Hemsworth was pretty fine. Chris Pratt (jeez too many Chris's) was funny and self ironic. Scarlett Johansson was a bit wasted. I am not really fond on the direction they develope Bruce Banner/Hulk and Ruffalo can do better. Nice to see Chadwick Boseman so short after his own adventure again. Tom Holland really developed into the best Spider-Man. Really liked his performance here again. 
The visuality was great. Most of the action scenes just brilliantly executed. The score was great. I had many shivers down my spine.

The problem is Marvel in general, they have managed to do a giant TV series, some episodes are good, some are straight up bad, but they keep you hooked and basically force you to watch all the movies to enjoy this one, you see, this movie will not age well, simply because as a stand alone, it is not a good movie, people defending it has a plot, no it does not, the plot is the entire marvel universe, but the movie has very little and at times inconsistent plot, as an example how come Vision was probably THE most powerful avenger in Civil War having the mind stone and all and in this movie is a complete rookie who needs saving by a simply enhanced human, but I wont get into much detail on the inconsistencies, the movie works because its fan base are blind to what a good movie should be when it comes to marvel, granted Marvel is not meant to be a Dark Knight Trilogy, its made to entertain more simple minded audience and as I said it is enjoyable to watch, but only if you watched everything else and you shut your brain a little bit to not get annoyed by the inconsistencies and lack of plot or good script.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

It's extremely difficult to tie the enormous number of characters in together without having the movie just be exposition, so they did a great job of focusing on Thanos and how he affects the Avengers and using the previous movies as crucial backstory. They did a great job of clearly explaining Thanos' mindset and justification, and I found his character arc intriguing and very believable. The visuals and performances, especially from Saldana, were great as always, and I thought the pacing of the movie was great. Certainly an emotional ending, and it didn't quite feel like it had that amount of weight as it seems certain that half of people who died will be brought back, but regardless of the implications, it was a good ending for the movie. I thought Thor's journey for his hammer and the explanation of why he needed it after seeming to not need it in Ragnarok, how he made that one attached to him, and why the dwarf was so necessary were all not well explained, but in the grand scheme of the movie it doesn't really detract and was just a lesser section.

","A gigantic, monumental film in every aspect, with epic battles, absurd development and spectacular villains, ""Avengers - Endless War"" is not only characterized as the best film of Marvel, the film also presages to be one of the best hero movies already made, and the only reason for not being such, is that in the end, we little believe what we see, because we know, that the situation will be reversed in the second, after all, it's a hero movie. The script that tells the story of Thanos, a kind of man who intends to give mercy to the world killing half of its population, thus ending, with the shortage, Thanos is a hero of absurd development, and beats head-on with Nolan's joker, as being the best villain in the movie of heroes, putting different universes and countless heroes in the same universe, the directors are successful in embedding several stories, not always with a perfect rhythm or the perfect excuse for, but, it does not get boring, nor gets to leave one or the other too much to corner, which is a merit grade. The cruelest thing about the film is that we understand that Thanos wants to end half of the universe, the character does not think of it as genocide, but an act of mercy to the suffering of people, and we can not support it, but we understand its actions, Thanos is not a sovereign and robotic villain, he is human, perhaps and strangely, the most human of the film, and watching coldly, perhaps the hero of the film, this characterization of Thanos and the development of it, is simply brilliant and magnificent. Technically the film is a show of special effects, and directing action scenes, great choreographies and frames, and cleverly putting battles in separate areas, not creating a big mess in a single center with all the heroes, even so, sometimes it seems that something came out in the editing, the transition in many moments is completely inorganic, just like your photo revesa and changes according to the core on screen, although this is not necessarily bad, it's just a touch of visual marking, well adjusted soundtrack, jokes in the right moments and well-balanced drama, Avengers infinite war is a well directed and finished film.

Everyone's plot felt rushed into one and another. This is the failure you can find in Batman vs superman.

","Of course, in order to understand everything that is happening, it is necessary to know and imagine at least a little bit all the plots and the entire structure of the philosophy of other films about all the characters of the Marvel universe. But there is also no doubt
that the next series about the ""vast team of superheroes"" is a sequel to the previous film adaptations of 2012 and 2015, as well as the nineteenth film of the Marvel cinematic universe. According to the plot, the ""old"" team of ""Avengers"" (Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Black Widow, Captain America), join forces with the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and the rest of the ""newly minted"" characters (Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, Black Panther) to fight Thanos, who is trying to collect infinity stones that allow to destroy and change everything around. The Infinity Stones, an addition to the Infinity Gauntlet, is a separate milestone in the history of Marvel superheroes, who first appeared in 1977 comics, and only the most ""desperate fans"" know everything about them. For all the obvious ""piling up"" of plots and heroes, the picture itself does not particularly ""sink"": due to its ""combat"" filling (especially at the beginning) and an impressive ""visual"".

Some things happened in TR that I wasn't fond of, but they turn out to be resolved anew in AIW. It sets up some big new problems though, so how effective AIW turns out to be will depend on how well they bring it home in A4. People who want to judge this one harshly -- just wait.

","First of all, Full marks for the action and CGI of the film. It was mesmerizing as always. The storyline is different than other Marvel movies, in this one, the Villain wins. Other than that, it's the same action adventure that other avenger movies are famous for.
Now for the bad part, If you start making logical conclusions out of the script, there are a lot of loopholes and shortcomings. Firstly, No other government forces show up to fight against Thanos, in spite of Warmachine warning them of upcoming event and the reunion of Avengers. Do they not care enough to fight for their lives? Secondly, why does the army of wakanda has Spears and swords rather than guns. I did not watch the Black Panther movie, but when these people have flying cars and ultra sophisticated technology, did they miss out on inventing/using guns? Thirdly, Almost all the final stones that Thanos need are just handed over by the avengers or their allies. And they are trying at all to defend life in the universe? Lastly, the characters are emotionally weak, which eventually leads to their downfall. Starlord does it twice, once by not killing Gamora when she asks him to do so, and other by waking up Thanos when Avengers are about to remove the infinity gauntlet from him.

Some people gripe the CGI was sketchy at parts. I would disagree but also if you payed for 3D I bet it would be a lot better then you think. I may go see it again just for that reason this is a good movie to see in 3d.

Thanos and the man who played him (Josh Brolin) is as good as any joker or guy who played him dead or alive.

Thanos is one of the best MCU villains, he is evil. He has a clear goal, that of which he thinks is good, but everyone else thinks the opposite. The minions are expendable and the audience does not get to learn about them before they die. These characters are also all pitted against mirrors of the MCU, matching powers of the villains and heroes is a great touch.

","This movies marketing even started off great. The trailer for Infinity War is the most watched on youtube ever. I remember coming out otf theatres with a feeling I've never had after watching a movie in theatres before. Not a single scene was wasted in my opinion. This movies is far superior to Endgame in my opinion because of the real stakes, Thanos, and character arcs (mainly Thor and Iron Man). The action is phenomenal and the fight vs Thanos is far superior to the cgi blob in Endgame. I know some people might say Dark Knight or Logan is greatest cmic book movie ever and while that is fair due to the themes those movies have, I don't think its a debate for most entertaining. The pacing, story, shocks, and characters are all amazing. It paid off on the build up and I would've been fine with the MCU ending here. If it continued I wished it would of been as prequels or a world after half the population was eliminated. The two stand outs for me are Thanos and Thor. Both on a journey leading them to each other at the end. Thors arc was phenomal and proved a comedic character can turn into a real and depressed one real quick. The pay off (wakanda entrance) is the greatest movies scene ever in my opinion even though Captain America lifting Mjolnir made me happier in the moment. I get goosebumps every time the Wakanda scene comes on tv. This movie turned thanos intomy favorite villain of all time as well as a top 10 movie one no doubt. He is menacing, worked for everything he achieved, surprising (like throwing Gamora off cliff), and sympathetic at times. The resect he gives to opponents makes him respectful in some of the audience's eyes. What a movie.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","It took some time for me to get around this movie. Was really looking forward to it, maybe that was the reason it took so long, finding the appropriate mood and day to check it out in 4k on my tv.
Finally I managed to watch IW a few days earlier and it went by rather fast and felt to be an unfinished movie, like it should be. But it felt to be lackluster too and also highly inconsistent in terms of writing. Like how the movie starts and how it progresses regarding the villain's actions. Like his personality is shifting based on the part of the movie, being overly violent, then dismissive later on. I sympathize with Thanos' character but the movie clearly wants to make him an indisputable evil lots of the time, however I look at it, and wanting you to understand him at other times, which just feels highly inconsistent once again. In addition all the new tech/powers associated with either side are breaching into the territory of 'anything goes' leaving lots of plot holes and leaning into convenient writing. There are no rules anymore, the story dictates what happens to whom which breaks the suspension of disbelief a bit. Lots of stuff is going on here, and the disjointed nature really shines throughout. There are too many people perhaps featured in this film. It might feel rushed but it definitely cannot leave enough space for development. The humour felt rather tacked-on in a lot of cases. Like almost every scene has to include a few jokes at least. It felt tiresome by the third one.
Overall, without going into further rumbling, I can tell that I enjoyed IW but felt nothing especially special towards the end. The whole movie feels so unimportant and it heavily goes overboard with some (supposedly temporarily) actions. I liked Avengers much more with its more grounded approach and these huge risks, like the fate of the universe are really outdated at the moment and just make for dull movies overall.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

This odd belief that there are alien species that will/can procreate with humans or want to is absurd. It's akin to showing a mammal try to have sex with a plant.

Most people I know go to see superhero movies for the escapism and to feel the triumphs of good over evil - sometimes even by the common man rising up. Marvel sometimes gets props for blurring the lines, creating complex flawed heroes, sympathetic villains and hard choices. But there still need to be the broad strokes of victory (even if with sacrifice).
Congratulations, Marvel and the Russo Brothers, you've managed to out-bleak the darkest DC movies and I think it is a cheat of the worst kind that you will in some way ""fix"" this over several future movies. I have not felt this depleted in a long time after seeing a movie and I've heard others walking out of the theatre (or in these reviews) saying they may never watch another Marvel film if the sole focus is on stringing along the franchise and effects instead of telling a compelling tale within reasonable bounds of a single film.

","This film was not at all what I expected or hoped for out of Infinity War. By no means was it a bad film or undeserving of praise, but there were details that could have been executed better. The plot, though it came with a few surprises, was ultimately rather repetitive and could have taken place in a much shorter span, leaving time for more character development (which was lacking) and a chance for our mightiest heroes to truly team together and fight Thanos-what I think we were all expecting out of this culmination of ten years of the MCU. Additionally, it isn't much of a cliffhanger if every we know that the majority of the characters who ""died"" are coming back for later films, and it only saves us temporary grief. Although this is personal preference, it could also have been darker. I love humor as much as the next film-goer, but at some point there has to be a line. As previously stated, this is the culmination of ten years' worth of films building up to this moment, and I spent most of it laughing rather than crying, as did many of my companions.
None of this is to say it was a bad film. It was much-anticipated, and there were moments that broke my heart. I was on the edge of my seat for a good portion of those two-and-a-half hours, and for good reason. The scoring brought tears to my eyes more than once. It was a good film.

","'Avengers: Infinity War' shouldn't have worked. It has over 20 major characters and only 149 minutes to fit them all into a cohesive story, but somehow Anthony and Joe Russo (along with screenwriters Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus) managed to not only make it a good comic-book film, but one of the very best. The fact that it brings together multiple different franchises is a groundbreaking achievement in its own right, but the film actually accomplishes more than that. It's a film that's not afraid to take risks, one that takes audience expectations and completely smashes them, delivering something that stands out from the rest. The majority of characters are well balanced (apart from Steve Rogers, in my opinion) and the pacing never drags, aside from a couple of side-plots being slightly too long. The film also has a good handle on tone; it knows when to be funny, but never loses its sense of drama and fully delivers on its most serious moments. The action scenes (while mostly GCI driven) are all exciting and grand in scale, and the score by Alan Silvestri is one of his best in years. On top of all that, the film is always fun and has its fair share of epic goosebump-inducing moments. The ending of the film initially felt disappointing, but reflecting upon it made me realise that it was actually perfect and one of the things that makes the film so great. It's not the best film of the MCU, but the way in which it takes real risks and offers a genuinely unique experience elevates it to be one of the very best in its genre. 9/10",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

And seeing as it is a cumulation of 10 years of action packed marvel films, it had all the ingredients to be a great film. And that's what it was. As one of the most highly anticipated films of the 21st century, Avengers Infinity War certainly delivered. From the opening 10 minutes it set the tone. Thanos made a statement killing the much loved Loki and Heimdall whilst Thor was made to watch, and that he abused Hulk to the point that he didn't come out for the rest of the film was terrifying. Although certain characters such as Captain America, now going as Steve Rodgers and certainly not Nomad, and Black Panther didn't get enough screen time was annoying but the standouts such as Thor and Scarlet Witch was promising with a lot of goosebump moments and the best villain Marvel has produced, Thanos. The final deaths were not as emotional as it is likely that they will return, but it definitely sets up Avengers 4 nicely with that film expected to end the storylines of the original avengers (Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Black Widow and Hawkeye). But similar to Drax when he says at the end of GOTG ""Ronan was only a puppet, it's thanos I need to kill"".

1652,28 April 2018,welcumdadarkside,10," 14 Million Infinities
","In a nutshell, Infinity War is Marvel's version of Inception. Time is of the essence or is it? One shot at survival and 14 million chances to get it right? Baby Gamora balancing the weapon like the totem in Inception balancing the countless spins reality could take? 
Amongst the rubble of Titan, Dr. Strange sat like a static hissing telecommunication system, using his time stone to forsee a future where the Avengers get one shot and one shot alone, to set things right- to win the ""infinite"" war against Thanos. (The title of the film itself is very evocative.) 
The irony of Thanos's ""mercy"" where he ""spares"" Toni's life is not lost to me. But hey we have a villain who keeps his word(in exchange fo the time stone). The Avengers have their super powers but Toni trumps them all because his gift is his mind. And that mind will resurrect and reboot the Marvel universe- no more tricks Thanos told the good doctor very sternly, well well Voldemort-Shrek hybrid, you have been played by the wizard. It's all about the long con, and those who think outcomes through patiently, don't lose any war, because they see beyond their pride and know when to attack- but most importantly when to retreat.
Its ""strange"" how alike Toni and Dr. Strange are in their characters and yet one is flamboyant and the other restrained. No matter how he comes across, Toni is arrogant sure, but he's level headed, logical, genius and most importantly not egoistic. 
The Dementor like creature that told Thanos to sacrifice a soul to get the soul stone out of Vormir, was nothing but a version of Thanos himself(like a horcrux), who is banished to Vormir, and left powerless, by the Avengers, who win the war in the infinite future. Its genius really.
From start to finish, it was a visual treat. The battle in Wakanda, was something else entirely. Thor getting his new hammer and arriving in style in Wakanda, The tenderness between Vision and Wanda, gosh there are so many mouth watering treats, scene after scene. And the humour laced with the impending doom.
The heroes of the script apart from the writers, are the visual superheroes , the animators. Cant wait to see Marvel top this and set a new record by breaking their previous one.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

1661,25 April 2019,ryanwinning1,10," Infinity War is Cinematic Perfection!
","There is no film, or series that is comparable to the Avengers entire series and Infinity War completely blew Age of Ultron away. I think the directors, and writers for this movie deserve a ton of credit for how they wove all the MCU movies to this point together without skipping a beat. What they did was so complex, yet it came out very easy to follow as I watched the movie. One mistake anywhere throughout the film easily could have blown everything, but I thought it was flawless. The last 2 Transformers movies are a good example of a high budget movie where a couple mistakes early on just take all the credibility out of the viewing experience and then the viewer can't help but roll their eyes throughout. I double down: Infinity Wars maintained credibility throughout and there were absolutely no character hiccups. I'd like to point out that in the most star studded cast ever Josh Brolin stood out and completely stole the show, in his portrayal of Thanos. They did a really cool job with the CGI to sort of make Thanos resemble Brolin and also follow his movement. I assume they would have had Brolin in some sort of a suit so they could easily mimic his movements for the character, but his voice acting was on another level. The way he inflected the tone just sent chills down my spine, and sent the message across to me of exactly what Thanos is all about. Like you can tell from the tone in his voice that he's been wiping out planets and civilizations for so long that he feels no remorse, and he's actually doing a good deed to the Universe every time. The scariest part of Thanos is that he truly believes he's the good-guy even though we've all established that he is the most evil dude in the Universe. I couldn't have imagined anyone else coming anywhere near how well Josh Brolin portrayed this megalomaniac! They did such a great job of casting every character I think. So far there is only 2 actors that I didn't like cast for the role they're in: 1. I don't like the way Danai Gurira plays Okoye who is T'Challa's right hand lady in Wakanda. She just always seems like she's trying too hard to be tough. The other person I don't like the casting of and has me sort of dreading End Game is Brie Larson who plays Captain Marvel who is supposed to save everyone in the next movie as we got the little Egg in the final scene after the credits of Infinity War. Other than that the cast is great. The balance of all this different colourful personalities of super-hero's seems to be spot on here.

","The Russo Brothers have created something that could have messed up really bad. But it doesn't and is complete perfection. Lets me first start off by saying the wait for Thanos was definitely worth it. Josh Brolin puts in a spectacular performance into Thanos and really does scare you and most importantly you buy his motives, I would even go as far as saying that Thanos is maybe the best MCU villain to date. Another thing that I would applaud the Russo Brothers for is definitely not pulling any punches, when action is needed it is great, even better than their last superhero movies. And when their is emotion needed you definitely feel it. But one of my favorite things in this movies is the Universal stakes really hit home on a visceral level were this may not be the case on many of the past comic book movies. Lastly, this is not a stand alone movie, this is a movie one decade int he making and you definitely feel that fro the opening credits to the end credits.

","Look, whether you look at this film as a marvel fan, like me, or like a critic, like me, you can't deny that this movie subverted your expectations. This movie something very interesting which I haven't seen before; making the character who appears to be the villain be the protagonist. From the very start of this film, Thanos had been attempting (and succeeding) in obtaining all six infinity stones. This movie wasn't about the Avengers, or Tony Stark, it was about Thanos, the protagonist whom nobody wanted to see succeed. But as many movies do, the protagonist wins in the end, and we all leave the theater crying and upset about this. This isn't my favorite movie of all time (that title goes to The Dark Knight), but it most certainly is in my top 10.

1699,5 May 2018,boydmatta,8," Very entertaining, but unfortunately has some flaws
","Starting with the positives, I thought the film was an overall blast. I was engaged and entertained throughout, and never was I losing my attention. I felt there was clear motivation for the villain, who (unlike most MCU villains), had some personality behind him. The acting and filmography were great, however it's the narrative that for me, restricted this movie to an 8, rather than a 10.
For me, no film should be worthy of a 10, if it includes a disposable CGI army. The first avengers had the Chitauri, the second Ultron bots, and this one, some mad 4-armed aliens. They had no backstory or motive, and only provided action sequences. There was no emotional connection, and I was disappointed that Marvel has allowed this to happen in every single Avengers film to date. 
Furthermore, this film is unable to stand on its own. Having seen most MCU films, I knew who each of the pre-established characters was, their motives, personalities, etc. However, trying to learn who everyone was from the film alone leaves a lot to be desired. I know people will argue that more or less nobody is going to see solely Infinity War, but it just doesn't hold up as a well as other franchises, where later films do not require the rest to stand on their own - e.g. Back to the Future, The Dark Knight trilogy, etc. People who haven't gone to see every Marvel film may be lost, and those who I went with didn't have any investment in some of the characters. 
I would also give the film a lot of credit for balancing the characters as well as they did, but having characters who are very light hearted , mixing with those who were quite dark, and jumping between them felt disorientating. Ultimately this was the curse of the MCU expanding so much, but other films have juggled multiple groups of heroes' quests much better - e.g. The Lord of the Rings trilogy. 
Hulk's disappearance was also poorly done. Though I understood that being beaten by Thanos would have reduced his confidence, it doesn't fit his character in the past. When Thor blasted Hulk in Ragnarok, Hulk simply became angrier that he was losing. Hulk also refused to come back, despite Thanos not actually being there - referring to the last fight - so why didn't he come back then, when he knew he could beat one of Thanos' henchmen. Also, when the Hulk lost to the Hulkbuster, nothing stopped Banner hulking-out again. The film only needed a brief dialogue between Banner and Hulk, so explain why the Hulk was afraid to come out. It's absence irritated me, and undermined the character. 
Finally, Thanos' quest has been overdone in the past, and didn't carry the same weight, due to more logical alternatives being easily plausible within the film. For the former, the (now exhausted) plot of the villain wiping out huge numbers of people, for the benefit of those who survive, is an easy way for scriptwriters to justify their villain's actions. However, Thanos needed something more original. Batman Begins and Watchmen are both relatively recent superhero movies, that had this plot (though in the first, the villain fails, and in the second, the villain succeeds). For me, this narrative became stale after the first Kingsman film did it. Now for the latter, the powers of even only half of the infinity stones, would undermine Thanos' entire plan. The abilities of the reality stone, means that it can transform matter. Therefore, it should be able to transform any 'waste' matter, into food. This would give the universe far more longevity than just killing half of its occupants, and would be better morally. Thanos would be more than capable of this. 
Though the film was great fun, and I would definitely recommend it, Thanos' objective is incorrect and pointless, Hulk is essentially removed from the film with no explanation,it has some pacing and tonal issues, and the CGI monsters was bland. Although many of my complaints will be seen as nitpicks by the average movie-goer",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","Infinity War. There are many things to say about the film, but for the most part, I liked it. I liked several of the character interactions, some that were actually genuinely surprising. Thanos himself was also a great villain to add onto the current line up of MCU villains. There were some genuinely funny moments in the film, but the ending will leave a massive impact on you. To explain it, let's just say that when my Dad and I left the showing of the movie, practically no one exiting from the showing of the movie discussed it. It is genuinely an emotional roller coaster, with how the ending credits seem to paint the illusion to an obituary, or even a list of casualties.

1702,24 January 2020,blackwidowis7cool,10," Lives up to the hype
","Having known exactly what happened at the end of this movie, I was uncertain for a while about watching it because I figured it wouldn't have the same 'wow' effect on me like it did on all the movie-goers that went in not having a clue about what was in store for them.
Thankfully, though, I had forgotten a couple crucial details, so was still awed by the whole thing.
It has a solid and VERY well-written plot that conveys a perfect balance between dark and light i.e. - manages to convey it's heavy and serious plot with the perfect amount of humour, which is enough to keep it from becoming too depressing and not too much that it can be accused of not taking itself too seriously.
The acting is solid - everyone steps up their game and really gets you involved in their stories and the main story.
I listened to this at night, and so as not to disturb the rest of my family, I had the sound down very low, so I couldn't hear the musical score very well, but the little bit I did catch was haunting, beautiful and evoked many emotions, so I'm fully intending to sit down at some point very soon and rewatch it with sound.
The climax is awesome - very tense, emotional, and just shocking. As I mentioned earlier, I had forgotten a couple crucial (VERY crucial) details, so when I watched it, it made me just as shocked and just as horrified at particular scenes as the characters.
And I applaud the cast for their performances during their characters' deaths or their characters' horror at seeing other people without any warning just disintegrate. They really sold it there and, while I can't imagine what they must have felt watching other people die (especially with Tony - everyone with him died), I really cried. It's a very sobering moment.
Infinity War is my current favourite of the MCU movies that I've seen so far and the best of all time, in my humble opinion.
It has one of the greatest plot twists of all time and really delivers on all the years building up to this one horrifying moment.

One slight problem that i had and keep in mind this is little to not even a small problem; some intense fight scenes and action sequences have too many things going on at once and so many characters on screen at once which is cool, but it can distract you and confuse you but i learned to just go with it, like i said, it can either be good or bad, and i think its a little bit of both.

Another personal problem was that im watching all the Avengers movies (4 movies) in a row and it gets kinds confusing here since i haven't seen doctor strange or guardians of the galaxy, but i get the whole jyst and at least i know who they are; it might have been a stupid choice, but its too late now anyway.

","Good action, good special effects, and a terrible stupid and predictable plot. You know a movie is not good storywise when you keep looking at your watch to know how much time is left before it ends. And that's what I did when watching Infinity War, because the movie was so absolutely predictable that it got tedious. Also, it had not one, but TWO instances of one of the cliches I hate the most, the ""save a loved one, let the world die"" cliche. And both are announced from miles away. When Vision makes the correct decision of committing suicide by having the mind stone destroyed and everyone is stupidly against it and when Dr. Strange says he will let Tony or Peter die rather than surrender the time stone. Sure, let half the universe die (including many of your loved ones) so you don't have to see THIS ONE PERSON die or kill them. And no, there's no circumstance when this will ever be right. In the case of Dr. Strange, just to make the NEXT movie even more predictable, it's clear that giving up his stone was part of a plan to make the one future where Thanos is defeated come true. That means I already know in broad terms what's going to happen in the next movie, especially with Fury calling in Captain Marvell in the post-credit scene.
Added to that is how terrible the fight scenes were. Not in that they were badly choreographed or executed, but in how stupid they were. I'll just mention two instances, so keep from being repetitive.
1. Dr. Strange or Wong could have beaten Thanos and his minions instantly. Just materialize a teleport opening around their necks and close it. Problem solved. This is as stupid as not using the luck potion or the time-travel amulet in Harry Potter to defeat Voldemort.
2. Why the hell is Thanos wasting time punching people after he got the reality stone? Just do what he did to Drax and Mantis to everyone. Turn all of them at once to confetti or cotton candy. Wish the mind stones off Vision's head and into his hand. And so on and so forth. This, in its turn, is as stupid as Green Lanterns making those constructs of theirs because writers think they look cool, when they should just disintegrate their enemies using their allegedly omnipotent rings of power. Only limited to your willpower and imagination still gives you a lot of leeway to use the best possible option: death rays.

","So here it is, perhaps the most anticipated superhero movie ever + the 3rd Avengers movie to date. This time Thanos takes over villain duties + i have to be honest, during the 1st 10 mins of this movie i was unsure if he could cut it alongside Ultron, but i was proved wrong, he's as badass as they come. What i wasn't so unsure of in those few minutes is that some of the heroes might not make it, but to save from any spoilers, i won't say who or when.
 The plot for this movie is a simple one, but one that has been used for some great superhero movies and used here for best effect. It revolves around Thanos scouring the universe in an attempt to gather all the infinity stones and that means facing off with some of Marvel's greatest characters including Spiderman, The Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Iron Man and Black Panther.
 The Special Fx in this movie are stunning and the action scenes thrilling, particularly the last climactic battle.
 As for the heroes, Spiderman with his wit, Iron man + Dr Strange, who face off with verbal sparring and Thor, who is always worth watching, are the stand-outs and of course Groot is always a laugh. Surprisingly though, captain America and Black Panther who are so good in their own movies are a bit bland here and lost in the mass of characters this movie has.
 So on the whole there is a lot to enjoy here, but there is some down-sides, mainly in the movie's middle set, where the movie gets a little laggy + perhaps there's too many heroes, especially given that there is no point in the movie where all the characters share the screen at once.
 So is this the movie of the franchise, definitely not, for me, Thor; Dark World and Avengers Assemble have that accolade, and it's not the movie of the year so far either, that goes to Rampage, but it's still great popcorn fayer and has points where your jaw may drop so far it hits the ground....yes Marvel really did just do that.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

Thanos was a very relatable villain he wanted to wipe out half of the Universe to balance it and to make sure what happened to his planet doesn't happen to anymore. Thanos also had a very good connection with Gamora in the movie Thanos seemed like a cold being who loved no one but he loved Gamora and you can see it in his eyes when he talks to her because he's very hurt by the things Gamora says to him. I really did feel for the ""mad titan"" and Thor omg first Ragnarok now this you have to stop or my head will explode with amazement. Captain America was great again but didn't have as much time to shine as Thor and Iron man did. Iron Man as usual was amazing Robert Downey jr again owns this role like no one else can with there characters he has some really emotional scenes especially the call back to Homecoming with Spider-Man fading away just like he said in Homecoming he feels like that's on him. Doctor Strange also was really great in the movie and I saw what you did there with it was the only way ;) meaning the 1 chance of beating Thanos was to give him the stone and let him ""win"". I can't wait to see what Captain Marvel will do her movie and what she will do in Avengers 4 which seems like she will have a very big role in it. There are no words to describe how spectacular this film was such an amazing movie.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","Sorry folks, this movie was ridiculous. Not to mention that it was a dishonor to prime superheroes. It was like ""let's see how many heroes and mind numbing perpetual non stop action we can cram into the same movie"" , not caring about the flow, emotion or even if any of it made sense anymore.
And seriously guys, after everything that went down in Ragnorok, Thor's long awaited proclimation as King of Asgard and the salvation of the Asgardian people, to have it all decimated in the beginning of this film was total crap.
Marvel needs a huge enema for a Disney flush out and bring Marvel back to its glory.
Sorry folks.....In my humble opinion, I give it a thumbs down ... and only 2 stars, just for Disney's ballz for pulling this crappy film off. What a shame...Disney got to you too, Stan Lee.

","As always I went into this film believing it was going to be one of the best Marvel movies of all time but once again I am disappointed with the outcome. Don't get me wrong as far as what the fans want to see such as good CGI, their favorite heroes all together, descent action sequences, and random comedy; this film is not bad at all, but I was hoping for the MCU's tenth film to be their very best. two hours and thirty minutes is more than enough time to give each hero the spotlight and display their abilities or heroism but it seemed as if Thor and Doctor Strange were the only two with that wow moment I was hoping to see with almost everyone. RDJ has mastered the art of timing when it comes to comedy and jokes and I loved seeing the bond between him and Tom, but aside that this film was just so ehhh. Banner was Hulk literally for three minutes then for the remainder of the film is bruce which is the exact opposite of what the fans were hoping for. Towards the end of the movie during the climax I was expecting some of the best action sequences Ive seen in years and they were so mediocre. I feel like it was such a waste of talent from the actors themselves and for the heroes.

1745,9 September 2018,john-c-wallace,1," Rivals ""X-Men Last Stand"" for worst superhero movie ever.
","Let's start with the Zero of the movie; Thanos, AKA, Bane-with-no-brain, AKA, the son of Brutus from the Popeye cartoons. This guy's dream is to kill half of all the sentient beings in the Universe so there are enough resources to go around for everyone left; so he's basically the Joker on stupid pills. First of all, that idea is copied from a more intelligent version of a similar concept from ""Watchmen."" Second, are we really supposed to believe that Thanos is so dumb that he does not notice when populations of living things are cut back, that they grow back stronger, thicker and more robust? So what is he going to do; wipe out half the universe every 100 years as populations grow back? The stupidity of this concept is staggering. But it's really nothing compared to the banality of the character itself. Thanos is a guy who shows up magically in every scene with the same smug grin on his face then struts around goes; ""Ha Ha Ha, I'm too strong for you, weaklings, look at my giant arms and manly rock-like chin."" He's like the villain of some 1950's cartoon and he is more one-dimensional than Paper Mario. But it gets better, he is invincible, seems to know everything, and has some way to get around every superhero's powers. He's like a character written by a little kid; completely infallible and totally, unbelievably boring. ",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","Yes, it's worth watching on the big screen for the incredible MCU-multi-main-character action showdown sequences, that all these films have built up to, as well as the relentless pacing from it's ""medias res"" opening. It's also a welcome change because it pulls the rug from under most triumphalistic (Disney) American films in that it's wiling to eliminate characters and leave the audience at a loss to how the narrative will move forward in a world where the ones you're counting on are so utterly defeated. But what's most striking, and terrifying, is how timely the film is (the Russo brothers' helmed Marvel films have said a lot about our socio-political realties) with a villain that views the world as a zero-sum game and so believes it is righteous to cast aside entire populations.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

1749,5 May 2018,qeter,7," Should stay closer to the Comic Book story telling
","A very good attempt. The Marvel movies of today come closer to the strengths of comic books story telling: complex stories told on many narrative strings summing up to big finals. Digital art of today can provide the means to bring actors in real-live superheros feeling. A lot of this movie is to be liked. But the Marvel team should go back - one more time - to study further the story telling of the comic books. All good drawn stories do not go on with action scenes over pages and pages. That would be to boring and page-wasting for the reader. Action itself is done within very few pictures in comic books. One ""wham!"" and one ""peng!"". That's it. Nobody is interested in 10 pages of ""wham"" and ""peng!"". The needed action scenes are shortened in comic books (the fantasy of the reader jumps in) and the won comic book frames can be filled with in-between stories of love, hate, relation, politics, kisses, needings and longings of human beings universal told with the over-aggregated means of superheros. So please, reduce the time wasted on action scenes. Stay closer with the tellings of comic books. With each step the Marvel and the DC-teams go closer to the art of the telling in comic books, the better the movies have become. In Infinity War the grandios final would have been still more grandios with a reduction of the battle scenes to an absolute minimum. The first comic-movie that will dare to use an absolute minimum of time for battle scenes will come up with fantastic stories, I am sure.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","SPOILER: These is many things what can be said about this movie, and most of them are good, so why not talk about obvious stuff everybody keep forgetting.
1) This movie demands you to see all previous marvel movies since 2008. If you missed at least one of them, then you will enjoy this movies quite less. This movie only spends time on developing only one single character (the bad guy), because all previous characters were developed on previous movies.
2) ""Fans"" kept demanding quality villains and actual reasons behind their motivation. The last villain these ""fans"" were satisfied with was Loki back from 2012. So, Marvel just done that - they worked on creating a villain with actual personality, story and motivations. Yet, these same ""fans"" are now complaining about Marvel doing what they demanded Marvel to do.
3) Marvel is subscribing to left wing (cancer) ideologies of diversity (code for anti-white anti-male bigotry) and progressive stacking of victimhood (the biggest ""victim"" is always right). For this reason alone you can bet your life on the fact that Marvel will never ever kill off female or black super hero in one of their movies. Even if one of these character ""dies"", then it will be brought back to life in the next movie.
4) Ending of this movie (it being the first part of two parts) left a opening for the next avenger movie which will follow events directly after this one. However, keeping in mind points 2 and 3 in mind, the next movie most likely will be extremely predictable (lets face, this one was extremely predictable as well).",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","What can I say? Phenomenal!
The Russo brothers bought a sharp real edge to the MCU with their previous Captain America movies (Winter Soldier and Civil War) and were able to get past the superheroes to the people underneath. They've done the same with mad Titans and intergalactic shenanigans. And like previous instalments, they're not afraid to tear things up in the process!
The opening scenes show how devastating Thanos can be with his bear hands...let alone a full gauntlet. and with shocking deaths from the onset it really is a gritty rollercoaster ride. I was gripped from start to finish and the clever balancing of all the different arcs and events happening concurrently made the immense run-time of the movie fly by. 
From human heroes, to wizards, Thunder Gods and Galactic Guardians, everybody gets their time to shine and their part to play. It is testament to the actors who know their characters and the Russos for delivering, but you really do sense that everybody has some weight in this battle.
Seeing Thor back to best after the too light-hearted Ragnarok (in my opinion) was refreshing. and Doctor Strange take a very central role alongside Iron Man is great. Thanos really steals the show though. All of the heroes have had their stories told - this is his. and as it's slowly revealed throughout the movie you can't help but hope he succeeds.
Captain America wasn't as forefront as i expected but with part 2 to follow next year there is time for his swan song. I also thought Tony and Peter may have reacted more to being flung through space to an alien world. Apart from that and the absence of Hawkeye and Ant-Man, i cannot fault this movie.
It felt like a Marvel comic on the screen. The humorous quips amid fast-paced high-stakes battles. The looming and very real threat. The not-knowing who you'll see and when.

1851,8 May 2018,ryanbartlett-870-746486,9," Marvel Delivers Once Again
","The culmination of a decade worth of planning and preparation that will pay off very well. Continuing in the line of blockbuster movies, Marvel is about to bank in another billion, probably two, and maybe even three with Infinity War. The movie pits the world's great heroes against the universes greatest villain. And it doesn't disappoint.
 There have been many series that have culminated into a crappy finale, mainly looking at you Hobbit: Battle of Five Armies. Avengers didn't fall into the money grab hole and instead continued on their self-titled, and self-filled track to a hit. A key reason is it was able to balance probably the largest, most-expensive, and most famous cast in film history. The support-characters who fight for screen time in this film, are primetime actors who would be the star in any other movie. 
 The next thing was the villain and henchmen. They made the evil people evil. At points in the film, I was excited to see Thanos henchmen take on the avengers. Not to see the avengers do damage, but to see just how powerful and skilled these followers are. And on top of this, Thanos was portrayed in a such a way to where, we all understood where he was coming from. He wasn't turned into a DC villain where he is just some evil bad guy we've never heard of coming to destroy the world. Instead, Thanos was a villain that is ""evil"" to the core, in the earthly human sense, but at the same time he is a man of morals and passions that are leading him down his path. He even takes chances and risks and sacrifices to get there. It shows how mass murder isn't easy, even when he has all of the power in the universe. 
 At the end of the movie, which really is just a Part one of two. We are left with really their most important goal, and that is anticipation for the movie next year. With a couple of movies separating us from the next sequel, anticipation is building even more. This movie won't be featured in the Oscars, but it will definitely be the movie of the year, and probably the most memorable of the decade.

He alternates between being strong and being weak, being a badass and then a softie entirely for the convenience of the plot. There are no other characters that are given that much importance, seriously. Everyone makes an appearance though, and have their comic one liners but all for nothing.Captain America is virtually absent from the movie (except during his entrance scene). Black Panther is also an observer, so is Winter Soldier and Hulk, Yes u heard it right, Hulk is not there in the movie.

Each an every major marvel Superhero gets to pay his/her contribution in fighting against the almighty evil 'Thanos' with convincing and rich performances majorly because of the wonderful screenplay adapted by C. Markus and Stephen McFeely.
The major sub plot turnouts and plot twist building up to the climax have been crafted so masterfully to create maximum impact on keeping the strong momentum in the flow of the plot.

The characters and plot of this film have been set up over the course of many other movies. If you come into this film not knowing that, it will seem like a mess to you.

However, Thanos became very appealing to me throughout the progression of the story in Avengers 3 and I became heavily invested in his character arc.

Groups are split up and sent on different missions but are all for the same goal. The characters we know and love aren't really developed anymore considering they've already been developed before, but the most development comes in Thanos who for a CG character who is trying to murder half the universe, is a sympathetic character who thinks he's right. The acting is brilliant, standout being Josh Brolin as Thanos who makes the character feel real. The visual effects are mind-blowing as everything feels so real, it should feel goofy and ridiculous but it isn't. The music is decent but nothing mind-blowing the Avengers theme is a nice touch to hear often. The movie sometimes struggles in terms of cutting back and forth between many characters.

1923,5 July 2018,fandom_cultures,10," Best Marvel Movie Ever?
","Before I begin, there will be spoilers so you have been warned. Avengers: Infinity War directed by the Russo Brothers who also directed Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War is in my opinion not only the best Marvel movie ever but quite possibly one of the best superhero movies that I have ever seen. It has everything you can possibly want from a superhero film: high stakes, great action scenes, great acting, splendid dialogue, awesome special effects, and funny humor. The cast was great in this film but the star was 100% Josh Brolin as Thanos. He is hands down the best MCU villain and I know a lot of people have said that but I honestly believe this.
 First I want to talk about the overall scope of the film. This movie takes you to many places including Wakanda, Titan which is Thanos' home planet, New York, and other realms including Nidavellir. There are so many things that happen in the film with so many characters and I am impressed at how well the Russo Brothers manages to balance it. As Thanos quite put it, ""Balanced as all things should be."" 
 Next, the characters. I was a little disappointed when certain characters didn't get to meet other characters and I am hoping that they get to meet in the next movie. However, the best performance in this film is Josh Brolin as Thanos himself. He is one of the best movie villains I have ever seen. He had a good motivation though how he carried it out was flawed and he was not evil for the sake of being the villain. He wanted to help the world but in his own twisted way. The other characters were great in this film. I loved Thor's interaction with the Guardians of The Galaxy. Thor might also be one of the best parts of the movie and he really developed as a character. All of the other characters had a chance to shine. Tom Holland as usual was great as Spider-Man but I will get to his performance later. 
 The special effects were great. The different environments looked so awesome and even though some of it was CGI it still looked great. The Wakanda fight scene was one of the best uses of CGI. It didn't look too cheesy and it was grounded. Avengers: Infinity War has one of the best fight scenes which was the battle on Titan. I loved the Wakanda battle but the Titan fight scene just blew me away. 
 As soon as I came home from watching the movie I went to Spotify and added the whole entire soundtrack to my playlist. I loved seeing Alan Silvestri return to score the film. The score from the first Avengers film is one of my favorite superhero movie scores. This one is slightly darker and gives a feeling of dread to the film as well as melancholy. I also love that he only uses the Avengers theme at appropriate times such as when Captain America appears out of the shadows or when Thor enters Wakanda (Which is one of the most epic entrances I've ever seen!!). The score ""Even For You"" is really emotional and I nearly cried listening to it. 
 Finally, the death scenes. It is hard to choose which death made me the most sad. Oh who am I kidding? Obviously Spider-Man made me the most emotional but Groot and Loki were also sad. I kind of knew Gamora was going to die so that wasn't as sad but it still hurt me. 
 Overall, the film was a masterpiece and told a great story and balanced so many characters in one movie. It also gave us a sympathetic villain and great fight scenes as well as great character arcs.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

1928,26 April 2018,tandrasmiklos,6," The best Marvel movie after Deadpool
","I consider Deadpool the best Marvel movie because it ironically exposes us to the fact that we enjoy watching fictional characters jump around, say stupid heroic lines and save people. It gives us the phylosophical questions: ""Why can't we enjoy our current reality?"" or ""Is our reality/story more real than Deadpool's?"" I think it is pretty obvious, we use these stories to create a non-religious (for most people lol, shoutout to geeks:) mythology. Altough nowadays Marvel movies have come closer to not taking things seriously, there's still some overly serious attitude involved in ""saving"" the world. Of course, the best part about this one is that it's underlying question is serious, and the dialog always tries to joke, just like in the comics, just like Deadpool. And the meaning behind this movie's story? It's probably the dilemma of the Christ and the anti-Christ. Thanos's motivation for destroying half the living population in the universe is purely economical: he wants the living to prosper, he deems a universe wide Holocaust necessary. All this, after gaining the highest power known in the universe, which means theoretically he could have found other solutions to his dilemma, but for some reason he seems to be set on being a lunatic. And here comes our dilemma: why is he so sure that killing people is the only solution? Which is never explained. On the hero side, they don't really get why Thanos is doing what he is doing either, and they don't really get to participate in a philosophical debate about the topic. The action is relentless, and the visuals are decent, so it works as the blockbuster they promoted it to be. I gave it 7/10 because the most important character's motivations (Thanos) remained only briefly explored. The cheesy lines remained low, but that's because they kept romantic lines to the minimum, otherwise it would have been really bad (why can't anyone write a normal romantic dialogue? adults should have adult dialogues, not be like Vision, who is an AI and rambles like a teenager).

Though this is not my favorite MCU movie I think ""Infinity War"" is the best product the studio produced both because of the really high scope and because of the execution itself. I think the movie is so great because it contains almost everything you could ask (action, humor, heartfelt moments, great CGI, fantastic score, ...) in a balanced way. Furthermore even if the culmination of the MCU happened in ""Endgame"" it was here that every piece of the Marvel Universe was brought together for the first time. I remember to have an astronomical hype at the time and the fact that the movie resulted to be even better than what my hype was making envisioning me is something that I highly count. But the best part of this movie is its villain, Thanos. I loved him (and still do) and he absolutely stole the show and sets up Endgame perfectly.

Even the picture from the screensaver on the poster is not a screenshot - one of the heroes was not in that location. Third, this is an unconventional, let's say, ending. And so, in principle, it's still the same cheerful Marvel, with a bunch of superheroes, battle scenes, jokes and jokes. By the way, I would like to say separately about the Black Panther. Everyone was scolding the Russian dubbing, but in the original his voice is just as dull, plus all the Wakandans speak with a terrible African accent - it all sounds terrible, it's good that a little.

","Avengers: Infinity War is the 19th movie and also one of the most popular movie of the MCU. It was directed by the Russo Brothers (Anthony and Joe). It was the movie that celebrated 10 years of the MCU and it turned out to be really successful.
After Civil War, the group of heroes were separated. Thanos (John Brolin) came to Earth to collect 6 powerful Infinity Stones and his goal was to wipe half of the universe. The Avengers teamed up to fight Thanos and bring peace to the universe.
Avengers: Infinity War is a really good idea to celebrate 10 years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, full of entertainment and a lot of fun actually. The film was really dark with Thanos successfully accomplished his goal and wiped half of the universe, including some of our beloved heroes like Dr. Strange, Black Panther, Spider-Man, Star-Lord, Vision,... The music score was also dark from the beginning when Thanos and his children terrorized Asgard and killed Heimdall and Loki, I could see the dark theme which was really suitable. The end was really epic and tragic as well. I loved the CGI and the battle was really awesome even though they didn't win.
The movie was one of the most tragic, epic and darkest superhero movies I've ever seen...until Avengers: Endgame.

Overall it's a pretty cool and fun ride, but you certainly have to prepare yourself for typical superhero silliness. However, the silly superhero stuff is told in a mature, non-patronising way and it wasn't like the rest of the of the frankly ""daft"" superhero films of the past year. Yes, I'm talking about you, THOR: RAGNAROK, SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING, BLACK PANTHER and GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL 2. Though INFINITY WAR is certainly NOT realistic at all, it grips and has a serious tone that keeps you watching. The script is dynamic but also very funny in some parts and we get a good look at MOST of the characters. The plot is simple and nothing THAT new or fresh but it still grips and provides real closure on the already rather over-bloated MARVEL cinematic universe.

That compendium style of mini-adventures sees each trying to thwart the evil ""Thanos"" (Josh Brolin) who is in search of six infinity stones that will make him all powerful. What ensues are are a series of end-to-end combat scenes with astonishing pyrotechnics and visual effects. The story I found less engaging. There is precious little humour - even the normally charismatic Pratt has little to work with, and the usually reliable Chris Hermsworth's ""Thor' character just features all to sparingly for me. It's a sort of cinematic jigsaw puzzle that has an ending that just screams ""more to come"" at you, and after a whopping great 2½ hours I really could have been doing with something with fewer characters and less constituent moving parts.

1962,20 September 2019,dpg-87522,6," The most spectacular mcu movie.
","Avengers Infinity war was the most watched movie in 2018, because let's be honest, everyone saw this movie, and apparently everyone liked me, personally, when I left the cinema I felt confused in the sense that I had to ask the question ""Did I like it?"" The truth to answer this question I had to see it again, maybe not at the cinema, but I did it at home, I analyzed it and came to the conclusion that if I liked it, but that does not mean that I loved it, I simply prefer movies as the first of ""Avengers"", ""Ironman"" or even ""The Winter Soldier"". Well, if you're a marvel fan, before you explode in anger, I want to remind you that I'm not saying that the movie is bad, I'm just saying it's not the best. Why? It's simple, the movie is very complicated, such as that they could beat Thanos very easily, like cutting off his arm with the portals of Dr. Strange, or that Dr. Strange does the infinite cycle as he did with Doormamu, well I think it is written like this, but that does not matter, the point is that if Doormamu a million-year-old celestial being got bored, Thanos by logic, simple would also get bored and agree to its terms, but the movie is not very complicated and they make complex plans so that in the end one of them spoils him (Star-lord), or that the film is complicated more also with that sub-plot of Thor in search of a magical dwarf to make his ax, and the problem is here, at Thor Ragnarok we were taught that Thor is not the god of hammers, but that this is the god of thunder, therefore he does not need a weapon to defeat his enemies, but here the film is overlooked, and contradicts herself by telling us that Thor alone It is going to be able to defeat Thanos with that Ax, which, as I said, contradicts what they told us in Ragnarok, or that of the end that everyone vanishes, I wonder ""Am I supposed to get sad for them? The answer is no, because it is more than predictable that they would return, seriously the people who cry with it, make me sad. Now I'm going to talk about how good this movie has and I want to start by saying that it's just great to see all the mcu superheroes together in a movie, which I have to recognize the writers and directors that for a movie with so many characters did not not bad, to tell the truth unlike other marvel movies, this one has a good villain, that would be Thanos, that has an interesting story, and a justifiable reason, that if you analyze it logically the true villains of the movie specifically the avengers , to avoid the salvation of the universe, to tell the truth the battles are good, the action is entertaining, and maybe previously I said yes, it is very predictable that the characters that disappeared will come back, but if there were some that did die of Truth like Loki and Vision, I hope they do well and leave them dead. I dare to say that the best of this movie is its ending with the winning villain, something we had never seen in a marvel movie. Personally I would have liked more is that this would have been the last film of the mcu, nothing like an unexpected ending with the villain won and with half of the population ""dead"", but I would only add something else at the end, to give an end to each character that survived, for example a scene that Tony Stark stays in the lost space forever, the heroes of the earth admitting that Thanos was right, or something like that I loved, because apart marvel was done doing the favor to close with a flourish, because the movies that have been released after this one are simply not good, ""Captain Marvel"" is the typical original movie, with an annoying protagonist and the movie ends up being boring, Ant-Man and the Wasp It is more of the same, with a villain with silly motives, many things that lack meaning, excess of humor, the movie is very bad, Avengers Endgame is not bad, but neither stands out in any way, the hour of time is boring rid to, and you already talk about this movie in a separate review, and we get to the last movie that Marvel has taken out that it would be Spider-Man Away from home and this movie is bad, the plot is more than predictable, the villain has again a silly and repetitive motive, excess of humor, love is silly and forced, Spider-Man is a fool in this movie, please enlighten me and please tell me what this movie is good about, because everyone I know love that movie. Well back to the topic Infinity War is one of the great events in the history of superhero movies and I am not sure if it is correct to say of cinema in general, with great battles, with one or another thing that does not make much sense, but a good Villain, this movie earns its 7/10.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

1982,9 March 2019,chasemykleby,10," Avengers Infinity War is a lot, but in a good way
","Infinity War Review (10/10)
Avengers Infinity War is a lot, but in a good way. Marking the passing of a decade since the conception of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Avengers: Infinity War acknowledges that Marvel's audience has grown up. There's a seemingly hopeless amount of characters packed into this story, but the Russo brothers make the bold decision to establish big bad Thanos as the primary protagonist, and the film is all the better for it.
The film is very fast paced in the beginning but then it smoothes it's self out and slows. The insane amount of action and characters means that not everybody gets enough screen time, but most make an impact on the story, in some form or another. Some of the new relationships and conflicts work extraordinarily well - Doctor Strange and Tony Stark make for pitch-perfect rivals, and Star Lord's gut-wrenching jealousy toward the sculpted, hyper-masculine Thor is hilarious.
Every single member of the team tries their utmost to prevent the apocalypse, and occasionally, even come infuriatingly close to overpowering Thanos. But it's never quite enough, and one important distinction between Thanos and the Avengers is repeatedly highlighted - our heroes are emotional creatures, unwilling to sacrifice their friends for the greater good, while Thanos is stone cold.
The final act, including the post-credits sting, brings a chill, a darkness and a hush that represent something new in this universe. Infinity War is the first half of the final installment in the series, and it concludes with a premonition of finality. Its intimations of grief and terror feel shrewdly attuned to what is happening in the actual, unmarvelous world.
Ultimately, Infinity War is a great film and one for the ages. This movie goes right into the top 5 of MCU movies and it just might be in the top 5 of all comic book movies. I recommend seeing this movie on the biggest possible screen, to experience it in it's full glory.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","Yes, history repeats itself. The black panther phenomenon is back, now renamed as infinity war. An avengers' film didn't need all that false hype to reach 600 million, I supposed. The boldest superhero movie ever that could kill off any of its heroes just for the sake of making a masterpiece? Well, we are not so lucky, superheroes are for children because they don't die. They return, as multi million dollar potential still remains. So what's the point of fooling with incorrect ideas posted smartly to make one think otherwise. The secret lies with kids. No matter how mature or philosophical they pretend to be, a belief still remains that these works need grown up kids or real ones to break records. It's this idea that this film strengthens, putting Christopher Nolan's hard work to dust.
 And yet all this hype has found takers. In the world of today, humans too can be programmed (skynet beware). It happens so that mass hysteria gives way to a prolonged hypnosis that hinders the truth from coming out. There were times when bad films finally got what they deserved. But now it seems humans have gradually transformed into bots. A majority view is now a bot's view, programmed to perfection.

","I'm really mixed to positive on this one. It's hard to explain my feelings about the movie without spoiling it, so I'll say this: the things that this movie does well, it does it REALLY well. Thanos was great as villain (his motives, not so much), the action scenes were good, I liked most of the character interactions, there were some emotional scenes that were done well, and a few things will transpire that you won't see coming, which was very exciting. After Thor's last atrocious solo outing (Ragnarok), I didn't really care much for his character but this time around, the Russo's brought the thunder (pun intended); he was my favorite of all the Avengers in this film (even though there were some still some residual Ragnarok traits, I'm willing to forgive them). The things that it does bad, it does REALLY bad. A lot of the humor was contrived; some of those emotional/dramatic scenes were ruined by poorly timed jokes, something that Ragnarok and GotGv2 suffered from immensely. Towards the middle of the film, the scenes seemed to kind of jump all over the place but that's just a small nitpick on my part. Certain characters were handled in a way that really bothered me, but I can't divulge on that point without spoilers. Lastly, the ending just fell flat for me; I understand what they were trying to do with the ending and it DID work to some degree, but for everything that happened in the movie and for it to end the way it did...it just didn't sit well with me. Overall, I thought the movie was good...the Russo Brothers are excellent directors (Winter Soldier is still, by far, my favorite MCU film) and I'm ready to see what they have in store for Avengers 4!!! 3.5/5 Stars",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

They can't and so he retrieves the stone and begins his quest for the rest of the Infinity Stones. What follows it seems, is the Avengers pulling out all of the stops, trying to defeat Thanos and fighting a losing battle. Very cool, but hard to watch. Not sure, if I'll see it again.

","Avengers Infinity War was the greatest MCU movie of all time. From beginning to end, I had a grin on my face. The beginning scene with Thor, Loki and Thanos was a great scene with true emotion and feel, but what I didn't like was that Loki has all of these powers that he could've used against Thanos, but he decided to stab him. This just doesn't make sense. I liked the scene with Dr Strange, Tony, Bruce and Wong was very great and their battle was better. Thor with the guardians was a great scene, Spider-Man with Iron Man was great, and all of the other Avengers in Wakanda was all great. When Thanos sacrifices Gamora to get the Soul Stone, you could see that he was genuinely upset and didn't want to, but he had to. And then the battle on Titan didn't have a single thing wrong with it, and you could see the genuine anger in Star Lord when he realizes what happened to Gamora. And then the end scene once Thanos snapped, it had so much emotion and was so unexpected that loud uproar in the theater made it even better.

And then the final scene happens, the movie could of ended with Captain America in Wakanda but no, the movie ends with Thanos, the very last scene has no talking its just a completely visual treat, theres no evil laugh from Thanos at the end, just a smile; and when the screen goes black everyone is left in amazement at the fact for the first time.. the heroes lost... and the villain won, Josh Brolin makes his character feel more sinister than ever before, mix that with lovable characters, great humour and breath-taking action, and you have yourself one of the finest pieces of cinema ever put to screen.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","This is a wonderful event film which makes perfect cinema entertainment, however on reflection, and now my own hype for it has dissipated, there are quite a few questions and potential plot hole that actually bother me
SPOILERS AHEAD!
The film jumps straight into the end of Thor Ragnarok and Asgaurdian ship being destroyed with nearly all the Asgaurdians being killed. But what happened to Korg? They seemed to build him up in Ragnarok and he became an instant fan favourite, so for him to just be killed off screen seems a bit disrespectful to the character and the fans.
Also, why would the Hulk only show up right at the end? What was he doing? I understand it was so Loki could use the line 'we have a hulk', that Tony Stark used on him in Avengers, but there is no way the Hulk would have sat out the initial attack.
Speaking of the hulk, why, after getting a beating from Thanos, does he refuse to 'come out' for the rest of the film? This is not who THE HULK is! 
Remember when the Hulk one punched that Jitari battle worm thing? 
Marvel clearly does not. 
He has been getting weaker each film and this time decides to sit it out despite the fate of the universe being at stake.
Also during this opening scene, the ship is badly damaged and clearly exposed to space. Ebony Maw, one of the Black Order, is here, unaffected by this, just like everyone else. But later in the film, being sucked out of his spaceship kills him and you see him freeze in space. Why? Earlier he was unaffected.

There are a few VFX shots (such as fully-CGI characters, noticeable green screens, etc.) in the film that looked quite unpolished, but mostly very small aspects. But then again, the scope of the film is so huge that it seems impossible to fully render every element on every frame. Another element that felt quite lacking, for me, was the character development (especially for newcomers such as the Children of Thanos, and some heroes). No spoilers, but the purpose of the Black Order in the film is ultimately to serve as a physical threat for the heroes.

You can see for yourself, but as a fan of many Marvel superheroes, I was kind of disappointed at how some of them were portrayed (you'll see what I mean). I feel like Marvel made this film plot only regarding the end goal, hence they manipulated and portrayed many characters oddly (and incorrectly) just to reach that end goal. 
This whole film felt like the set up for the sequel. The film had an overly simple plot and seemed set up just to give background for the upcoming sequel. 
MY RECOMMENDATION is to wait until the sequel is out, and then watch the two movies successively. I think that would be the most satisfying.

","Avengers: Infinity War has some of the best pacing I have ever seen. The movie seemingly perfectly balances all of its characters between the different storylines and brings them together at the appropriate times. It doesn't feel like any one character gets too much of the spotlight, and very few characters feel like they didn't get their due. Despite how much I love Endgame, I have to admit this is something Infinity War does way better. The movie is also nonstop action. If they were going for epic climax, they absolutely nailed it. This movie brings together all of the characters for a massive battle perfectly. I also love the dark, unconventional ending. I appreciate bold choices when done right, and this absolutely was. Thanos was such a good villain and was very sympathetic. He really felt like he deserved to win. If that were the end of the story, it would get a perfect 10 and be the best MCU movie. Unfortunately, three things hold it back. First, I don't think the action choreography is as strong. The Titan fight is great, but the Wakanda fight is basically just two armies charging at each other. I still remember how great it was in the first Avengers when there was a tracking shot that moved from character to character and how everything was perfectly coordinated. Age of Ultron even had a scene like that. Infinity War just felt like, well, a war. The action wasn't as fun as it could be. But the more glaring problem is that the movie doesn't make sense. Them having Doctor Strange say they only win one scenario was such a bad writing decision. No scenario where Thor goes for the head? Or where Star Lord doesn't interrupt the trance? I can count half a dozen ways in this movie they could've won. I'm okay with them losing, but don't pretend like they couldn't have won. To say that this was the best case scenario was ridiculous. What would've made more sense is if, after Star Lord screwed everything up, Doctor Strange says something along the lines of ""we missed it, but I have a backup plan."" I can suspend my disbelief a lot in a fantasy movie, but I can't pretend I'm stupid enough to think that this was the only scenario in which they beat Thanos. Finally, I hate that Star Lord screwed up so badly. Thor not going for the head is fine. He made a mistake, but I can forgive mistakes. What Star Lord did was basically sabotage. Someone should've shot him in the head. As a viewer, that's not an enjoyable thing to watch, especially for such a beloved character. It would've been so much more satisfying if the heroes were at their best, and Thanos STILL won. The other way around, it's so much more satisfying when a hero wins against a great villain than against a stupid villain. In the same way, it's more satisfying if Thanos beats great heroes than dumb heroes.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

2166,7 May 2018,emiliecunning-21094,10," Best Marvel Movie Yet!
","After watching this movie now for a second time, I have to conclude that it is definitely the best Marvel movie yet! It certainly was tricky for the directors and writers to include so many different characters from the MCU in the movie, yet they managed to do so brilliantly, cutting to different character plots at clever points to tell the story. What really makes the movie so superior is that Josh Brolin's Thanos is a deep, complex villain who you can't say is inherently evil because he realises there are finite resources within this universe although his method of genocide is clearly not the right way to go about things! But Thanos is definitely the greatest Marvel villain to date, especially given that unlike many other Marvel villains, we have seen him before in the Guardians movies and post-credits for both previous Avengers films. The performances by everyone in this movie are exceptional, everyone is undoubtedly at the top of their game here - in particular, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr, whose characters have now evolved to such an extent that their desperation and desire for vengeance (especially in Thor's case) is truly apparent in the execution of their roles. Zoe Saldana's Gamora is also wonderful in this movie, I definitely like the character a lot more than before due to her heartfelt speech to Thanos before he trades her for the soul stone: ""All my life I dreamed of a day, a moment, when you got what you deserved. And I was always so disappointed. But now, you kill and torture and you call it mercy. The universe has judged you. You asked it for a prize and it told you no. You failed. And do you wanna know why? Because you love nothing. No one."" AMAZING WRITING! Not to mention, the special effects, oh my word, they are out of this world! (Literally!) If this isn't nominated for Visual effects come Oscar Time, there will be riots! The whole thing is just spectacular. It is certainly heartbreaking at the end to see all these characters being turned to dust, especially ones who are the more recent Avengers, but it certainly raises the stakes to have the movie end on such a gripping, apocalyptic note! Of course, many people believe these characters will be revived - come on, are you really going to kill off Black Panther? - somehow in Avengers 4, especially as there is already GOTG 3 in the works as well as Spiderman 2 & Black Panther 2. This probably means some of the OG Avengers are gonna hit the bucket, but we've had a good run with them and it's time for some new faces. Fingers crossed Bucky becomes the new cap (Seb Stan still has 3 movies left in his contract!) Will cry all over again I'm sure next April but I just cannot wait to go see it!!!

","Ok, so Stark, Strange, and Spiderman are aboard the ship after sending Thanos' henchman out into space-Alien/Aliens style. Then Dr.Strange comments that there's no way to turn the ship around to get back to earth. Did he forget he can wave a circular motion in the air and make a bridge back to earth or anywhere else in the universe? Iron Man could've set charges aboard the space ship- nuking it 1 min after they portaled back to earth and vaporized the entire ship and any data on board of where it's been. Thanos has no clue where the other stones are and Peter & Tony would be back on Earth to give near full might, minus Thor, back to the Avengers squad. How about Dr. Strange creating a portal above Thanos head, glove arm, or chest, and the other portal sending it into any sun other than ours in the universe? Cover blatant plot holes screenwriters...although this movie is geared towards the nondiscerning teen audience. So there's that..... or Strange could go back in time right after Loki was defeated on Earth and told Stark/Avengers. Heck, he could've went back before the attack and stopped Loki before he set into motion the invasion and told the others. He could've went back to after Thor came to earth and told him of all the events...and to tell Oden about Hela, etc & to stop Thanos before he attacked Gamora's world & ended it before it began. In addition, Gamora knows the stakes but folds and tells Thanos Voimir( spelling?) as to the Soul Stone's location. Caving under any circumstances is inexcusable but here it's atrocious. No reasonable character would do that. I'd tell Thanos some other planet and lead him on a series of goose chases until I (Gamora) could kill myself- since he has no time stone. Cut your tongue out and fingers off. Stab your eyes out, then jam a sharp knife like object into your ear. This is why scifi sucks for adults...particularly new Star Wars movies are really stupid. Like it takes a real genius( sarcasm) to concieve using anything at the speed of light to destroy things. You could've shot an escape pod at the speed of light at the Death Star and the Death Star would've been vaporized by the energy. Either have a universe where characters can conceive of these things from first sec of movie 1 or have them never think of it.

","Infinity War is one of the best Marvel movies (and of the Superhero genre in general), but is not perfect. 
The way the Russo brothers entangled all the stories of this past ten years is pretty good, and seeing all the near 30 characters of the MCU in one movie is a really cool fan service, but let's be realistic: the movie is a complete fan service. The weight of the movie is carried by 2 groups of heroes, leaving the rest of the cast there without doing something else that doesn't add much to the plot. One would expect to see all the characters together in the same scene, but some of these never met in the whole movie and didn't even do or say something remarkable. 
That's the BIG flaw of this movie, but there are so many good stuff here, like the villain, Thanos, the best character in the whole movie. His motives and actions are very well justified and portrayed by Josh Brolin. He is a strong character with a strong personality, and he steals the movie. 
The visuals are also very good, with a minor issues in some characters, who look like videogame PNJ. The music is so intense and is an emotional homage to the original Avengers soundtrack. 
Anyway, Infinity War is an enjoyable movie for superhero fans, and will be arguable considered as the ""best superhero movie ever"" by some easy-to-please fans and critics, but that's just a tag far from the reality.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","Never have I ever walked out of an MCU film so surprised and speechless! The studio really outdid it with this one! Infinity War lives up to the hype in the most amazing way possible to the point it even lives beyond the hype. With a mixture of such a great sense of humor, which seems to be a common thing now for the MCU to the darkest toned segments you'd think it's a DCEU film (Yes I just said that). The ending is just honestly the greatest yet sudden gut punch, that one would never even come close to thinking about coming from Marvel, but that's what makes the film so great!

Second, this is probably one of the best ever characterisation of a villain in a Superhero movie (even better than the joker in the Dark Knight). Thanos is the main character in this movie and the screenwriters did a great job developing a very complex villain charater. Thanons is super complex, fully of emotions and actually has a purpose in what he is doing and you don't find that often in villain characters.

","Infinity War was a spectacle of a film, I really don't know what to say as a big Marvel/DC fanboy, The film does kind of open a little clunky so I thought that was a little flaw. But to all this wait, it was worth it. The action sequences were non stop and the film didn't let me breathe from start to finish which I felt exhilarated as of seeing everyone reunite together for 10 years and that's what this film gave me. It does a solid job on it's performances with a big cast and it's so amazing to see them on screen again. The humor was hilarious and I love the way Marvel makes their jokes so memorable and it did deliver that. Thanos was a masterpiece as the villain or is he a villian? His CGI was great but by the last act it's quite noticeable, Either way, he was so great in this film, his motivation is so great it felt intimidating every time he appeared on screen and is a touching character at times and I love the way the Russo Bros really gave him a backstory that expresses the character more. The Black Order was ehhhhh idk but Ebony Maw was the one I felt more a character in him and was cool. CGI was overused alot with a big budget and it was great. The ending was a bit contreversal and shocking and will leave audiences heartbroken in which I thought was a very well executed scene that you feel tension once it happens. Overall, Avengers infinity War was a masterpiece of a film, if you go into this film with an empty brain with no idea about how it leads to this then this is not a film you'll be surprised if don't watch the previous MCU movies, the action sequences were so enjoyable, the humor was hilarious I only thought a very few didn't land and is a pretty unexpected and emotional film that hits you hard and I am totally speechless about this film 10/10",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

With epic fights, awesome characters played by an incredible cast, coupled with an incredible soundtrack, this movie creates the spectacle we all wanted. With that said, the ending is what I want to bring attention to. After Thanos snaps his fingers and wipes the universe of half of all the living things it holds, he retreats to a remote world to live out the rest of his days in peace. In his mind, he completed the mission he set out to complete; restore balance to the universe. We see him take a seat and quietly admire the sunset in the beautiful planet his little hut is on. A masterpiece of directing from the Russo Brothers. This is backed by an incredible final piece of music composed by Alan Silvestri that completes the scene in such a perfect way, it's hard not to feel emotion. It's not often we see a villain win in the end, but here we did.

First of all, you have got to admire what the Russo brothers were going for with this, the directing of this film is flawless. The writing and the acting in this movie is just fantastic, in my opinion the best portrayal of this movie, is Robert Downy Jr. as Tony Stark/ Iron Man, he had the best part of the character development in this movie. But in a close second comes Josh Brolin as Thanos, and thanos is the definition of what a movie villain should be, he was menacing, his motivation is excellent, you don't know what he was going to do next, thanos just puts me on the edge of my seat, and the something that he actually has where a lot of other movie villains don't, is having an actual good purpose for what he is trying to achieve, I don't see that in most movie villains nowadays. The comedy is great in this movie, if it's a marvel movie, you are definitely going to laugh a whole lot. The cinematography is great, I could see what's happening throughout the entire movie. I liked the action, but there were times where the action didn't get a lot out of me, and those times felt like the action was bland, thankfully, it's not that many. There were certain aspects of the movie that bothered me, and one of them was hulk. He barely showed up in this movie, and I wanted a lot of hulk scenes in this film, and that really upsetted me off. There were very few characters in this movie that just felt like they had no purpose of being in this movie.

It really didn't feel like that in movie. That put aside let's talk about the plot overall. The plot was pretty good and I felt it was well paced. There really felt like there was a reason to worry for these characters and I felt true suspense. Thanos motivations are pretty good until you think about it to much.

1.There is plot hole, we do not see Thanos how he destructed Zandar ,how he got the Power Stone , we also do not see Thanos how he battled in the beginning with Hemidall and Thor people.
2.Vison powers are not shown, you see Vision beaten up several times and stabbed like he is an ordinary guy and not an superhero , they had to show Vision powers, what we get from Vison is only that he shots a laser beam to one of the members of Black Order and what a surprise The Black Order beats his guts.
3.Groot powers are not also shown , i mean why you present a character when you dont present his special abillites.
4.Thanos uses the powers of four stones , come on Thanos with all that power how did you let without using the Mind and Spirit stone power ,this is ridicilous.
5.What we liked was to see Hulk battle ,but we only see him beaten up by Thanos and the green guy is afraid to show up himself.
6.There is not enough action at all , ok there are some awesome scenes between Doctor Strange, Ebony Maw and Thanos but we needed more ,we needed all the avenger battle against Thanos and not separated.
7.Iron Man suit is greatly advanced but with all those advances it makes it ridiculous and unbelievable, his suit was more original in Iron Man 1 and Avengers 1.

The only people I was into, were Thanos (amazing) and Gamora. It's difficult to be invested in that movie because right from the beginning, you're already in the middle of some actions, and it never stops, feeling like you may have missed something.
There isn't a real plot, more of a philosophical approach that sustains the film, but a pretty good one.
Thanos was frankly genuinely amazing. The dialogues between him and Gamora were the more interesting. The battles seemed too inconsistent, too many effects, too little story. The ending on the other hand was fantastic. It saved the film. I was expecting the usual ending (good thing Thor didn't go for the head lol), and was very surprised.

","If you're super into the Marvel universe, you'll love this movie. It's a great culmination of the last 10 years, and it felt more dynamic than others. I think it was fantastic that it made me care about Thanos and understand him, which I find difficult for other animated characters. The visuals were spectacular and in a few instances the shots looked absolutely beautiful. Most of the performances were pretty good, and I think the disparities in their performances had to come from being fed pretty awful lines of dialogue. The score was just as you'd expect, and there was nothing new about it. My main issue is with the writing. As I stated earlier, the dialogue was not good at all. Thanos seemed to be really easy to defeat considering the powers that he showed us that he had. He didn't seem to test the rules of his powers, or even use them at all. They clearly didn't have a ""refresh timer"" or something because of later scenes, so why would he not use them less sparingly? Most of it was predictable based on earlier scenes, and some of it felt like filler (but not much). The action was difficult to get into. It was at such a large scale that it was just more difficult for me to care about. I'd have to praise them for the ending, which made it much more enjoyable for me, but it didn't manage to push a 7 (It's a pretty high 6 though). I like how actions had consequences in this film, which is a relief from some of the other films (more than just Marvel) that I've seen recently. In the end, I'd like to give it a 7, but there were some aspects that were a little bit held back.

",This film has finally come. It took 10 years but it was worth it. Ever since The Avengers fans have been teased with post credits scenes and films leading up to this film. I was impressed on to how they made this film. It's helmed by the Russo brothers who directed the last two captain America films which have been brilliant. The plot follows Thanos as he travels the galaxy looking for the infinity stones and the avengers and guardians of the galaxy have to stop him. They divide into three teams One is on earth and the two are set up in space. This movie isn't film. It's an event and what I mean by an event is that this film is a massive pop culture event that fans of the marvel cinematic universe will enjoy. But if your not then this movie isn't really for you as A. You probably won't know who most of the characters are and B. You will need to sit through 18 movies to understand the characters. The best thing about this movie is the plot and the vfx. The vfx in this film are probably the best this year thanos looks brilliant. But I don't know whether some of the other cgi will hold up like iron mans new armour or mark ruffalo in the hulkbuster. The vfx are better than the black panther ones and they only came out two months apart. So that tells you something. It shows that every penny that went into the vfx was worth it. The movie has one of the best entrances by Thor which was absolutely the best thing. This movie is hardly focused on the heroes it's in fact mostly focused on thanos as he goes through the galaxy searching for the stones. He is the best character in this film josh brolin gives an oscar worthy performance. Also thanos wins by collecting the stones and wiping half the universe. It was so unexpected aswell cause the movie give some you hope thinking they can win. But they don't.,/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","...It's really hard to talk about this movie without giving everything or something HUGE away. What I can tell you is the bare basics of what you will be witnessing. And that is as follows: Everything you've seen, everything you know, is wrong. Your expectations are wrong. You are not prepared for what this movie has to throw at you. YOU'RE NOT. I surely wasn't; I found myself realizing my mouth was gaped open multiple times. Avengers: Infinity War is the cultivation of everything Marvel has built and it executed it almost flawlessly. There are only two flaws that can be found here. One, the pacing is a bit wonky at parts, as scenes cut away and tones can be shifted. Two, some characters don't get the spotlight that you might want them to. But these flaws are easily forgiven. As this movie delivers on EVERYTHING. The action is exceptional. The emotion is POWERFUL. The music by Silvestri hits you in the gut with every note. The story is at odds, taking turns in ways that you will never see coming, not even with clairvoyance. Now, I can't say much, but what I will say, is that Josh Brolin has given us, quite possibly, one of the greatest villains in cinematic history. He is scary, compassionate, charismatic, but most of all, empathetic. The Russo Brothers also directed their asses off and made their best work yet. That's all I can really say. You need to go into this movie blind like I did, because by the end you won't know what's coming next, you'll be speechless.

","Infinity War is one of the most unpredictable movies of the marvel cinematic universe (even when it has some predictable things) The movie is entertaining and funny, is an 149 minutes long, but it doesn't feel like it. The performances of all the actors is really good, but I had to highlight the performance of Josh Brolin as the villain, Thanos. The character is terrifying and you can feel that something could go terrible wrong when he´s on screen, he is the character that, to me, is the most interesting in the movie, and thetas really good, because a movie like this without a great villain could not be a good movie, and Brolin brings something additional to the character with his performance, even when the character is made by CGI, the performance is still very powerful, is like Andy Serkis as Caesar in the new Planet of the Apes movies. The visual effects are, of course amazing and makes what the best visual effects do, make you believe that what is on screen is real. Now, I have to speak about the negative points of the movie. First, it is a lot, the story tat they´re telling here could have been not a bit of a mess (like it is the movie) if they were telling it as a 10 episode series or something like that, but a movie can´t do that, so the result that we have on screen is a lot, and sometimes you can forget what some characters were doing at the beginning of the movie because they appear in minute 10 and the appear again on minute 40. Of course, everything that´s going on is important, but that problem makes you feel a little disconnected with some characters. Speaking about the characters, there were some that were really useless in the movie, and they were only there because they were introduced before. Stay for the scene after the credits, it is amazing, not like the one in Spiderman homecoming. In the end, infinity war will please fans and it will make them even more anxious for the next avengers movie.

","Boy oh boy, what great fun this film is. To think it all began ten years ago with Iron Man, and to now witness the scale and ambition is truly something special. It felt historic. Credit where credit is due, director, Anthony and Joe Russo blend all these characters in so well and seeing how they interact is as hilarious and special as always. Having spent time with them for so long now, we find ourselves attached and that's why it works and we root for them. I'd argue Thanos is the MCU's best villain yet, a character whose god complex and interesting ideology separates him from traditional notions of the villains in the MCU. Oh, and there's also the fact that he can actually compete with the heroes, with many of them feeling inferior to Thanos and his army. There is more depth to him that I first imaged, and the CGI and performance by Brolin is great. It's a treat to see the whole audience laughing, clapping, gasping-something not all films do these days. It's a testament to the creative team behind this universe, (Kevin Feige etc.) because they have simply been so consistently ambitious. If there is one thing, the humour in the film did surprise me, and with that said it does take away from the emotional scenes. It is a Marvel film however, and to think that its staple blend of humour and action wouldn't be as prominent is perhaps an oversight. When you actually think what this film has done, combing the ten years worth of stories, and putting together characters who haven't yet met, all in the space of two and a half hours, it is an achievement worth celebrating and enjoying.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","Avengers:Infinity War is a film that has a problem. A huge problem. Namely, how to encompass 10 years of screen history and 23 characters into one film so, that the end result would not take over three hours to complete, and not only be satisfying, but also good? It is hard, so the writers and the directors should be honored for having made a film as good as they did. There is also a great moral dilemma at the center, namely that of whether it is right to kill some in order that the many could have a better life? In that case, the films is really amazing, and also a great example of entertainment cinema. 
 But. The films is not that good, and I have never been a huge fan of these Marvel movies-Star Wars and Harry Potter are blockbuster franchises that I like much more. And sometimes the writing is a bit out of hand, and having more than twenty main characters obviously translates to the fact than not all are very well developed. Herein, also lies a great problem. Avengers: Infinity War is a great film, make no mistake, with the best superhero film ending since The Dark Knight, but in order to really know these characters(except for Thanos, who is surprisingly fleshed out and could contend to the title of Main Character in this film) you have to watch their solo films-something that sadly is necessary for a franchise like this.But, otherwise from that, this here really is a great film.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","Avengers Infinity War, the film Marvel fans have all been waiting for since the first Avengers film came out in 2012, has finally arrived and it is safe to say it has lived up to the hype from the last few years. The Avengers, Earth's mightiest heroes, have returned this time teaming up with the Guardians of the Galaxy, Dr. Strange, Spider-Man, Black Panther and overall the largest ensemble of superhero characters the world has ever seen on film to defeat the deadly Thanos. The film is large in everything, scale, cast, visual effects, action, just about all one expects to see and as it progresses, it doesn't shy away from reminding audience viewers how large it is. The film's time length was necessary to establish it's story and it's characters correctly. That said not every one is a fan of films that pass 2 hours for issues concerning the story dragging on too much and too many characters to explore with not many receiving proper care. The Lord of the Rings trilogy is the best example of films that reach the 3 hour length of time that is necessary to explore all plot lines. That trilogy worked out for many audience viewers though many that try and replicate this formula rarely succeed to accomplish what Lord of the Rings did. Avengers Infinity War is 2 hours and 40 minutes long and for the most part it succeeded in what it set out to do while many may say differently, especially those who aren't the biggest fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Disney has never been more the extravagantly triumphant corporation that it is today with all the brands and licenses they have the rights too and because Infinity War has turned a grand profit, earning an estimated $640.9 million at the worldwide box office it's opening weekend, the latter proves itself true.

This film is way too difficult to talk about without spoilers. So much stuff here. I will keep everything to a general nature.
This is a ensemble of Marvel characters, both good and bad. Amazing to see the multi-protagonist story structure done this deftly. George Lucas is a master at it, and well, it appears that the director here attempted to emulate him....it is a workable effort. The first act is re-introducing us to characters we all know (with a great entry by Captain America). The second act does the best it can, slipping into formulaic action and one-liners. But there is reprieve! The third act delivers a multi-layered, thought-out ending coupled with an awesome post credits easter egg scene that leads into the next film. So please folks, catch that last scene. *Just as a helpful FYI - as soon as the credits roll, there is enough time to visit the lavatory and return to view the final scene...about 5 minutes, I'd say.
It is a long film, be mindful of that. There is much violence also, parents be advised. 
My overall impression that this film succeeds at connecting the dots (albeit we all can see what it was without the dots being connected). It is rather predictable. Some scenes, either overtly or subtly, are telegraphed to us. I am not sure if this was deliberate or desperate. You be the judge.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","The biggest compliment I can give this movie is that there is a genuine sense of threat and an amazing stinger line. However, I consider this a fundamentally broken movie. This is the first movie of the Marvel universe where I genuinely could not engage with the heroes because of how fundamentally awful their decision making was. The film decided instead to grant all of its respect to Thanos, who despite the gravitas of his performance presents a philosophical perspective that is absolutely moronic. Despite this, neither this film or the sequel provide a strong argument against it, leaving it in a place where it feels like a respectable opinion. Look at other reviews and you will see how sympathetic people are to the cult of Thanos. That aside, the decision to have Dr. Strange give an excuse through the mechanism of destiny for the events of the movie to be ""the only way"" (paraphrasing) to defeat Thanos is the kind of ridiculously lazy plotting I expect of any movie with Dr. Strange. Also, the critical failure of character from the Avengers in Infinity War is their unwillingness to compromise their inflexible values in order to achieve something fundamentally more important. This would be okay if the second movie didn't give them a way out of this problem and undo all of the consequences of the mistake. This renders this movie philosophically pointless, if not philosophically harmful. What we are left with is a gripping but ultimately hollow attempt to cash in on audience investment in a franchise to sell a ridiculous spectacle, and convince people that it means something.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

2447,23 August 2019,tyler-catanzarite,10," Best marvel movie that isnt winter soldier
","This movie is probably my 2nd favorite marvel movie, it is just so perfect. For a 2 and a half hour long movie you dont feel it, unlike endgame, and unlike most part 1s of a 2 part finale, this one is the better part. In this film, the main character is Thanos, this is by far one of the best characters and villains in any superhero movie, I would only argue that the joker from dark knight is better and I doubt anything would top that. This film is just the right tone, dark, no sense of hope and quite bleak, it truly feels like they cant win the battle. The film sets up this tone perfectly by showing the asgardian ship from thor ragnarock completely destroyed and dead. Hulk tries to fight Thanos and gets beaten showing that even he cant beat him. Thanos snaps lokis neck and that sets up the tone for the rest of the movie, the fact that marvel of all people killed off a main character in like 5 minutes. Already you can tell this film will be different and it is. It's a superhero film in which the heros lose, and lose a lot. Even though I knew they would somehow be brought back to life I still felt the pain the heros felt.

","Although I was checking the score on a few sites, I have not yet read any reviews or comments on Avengers: IW, so this opinion is based solely on my experience earlier today. This movie is up there with the best fantasy epics of my adolescence, or with some of the greatest comic book/superhero movies of more recent years. It's huge. It's epic. It's amazing. It's a damn well orchestrated symphony. It's Beethoven's 9th. For me, it doesn't get any better. But...unfortunately, not everyone will think that, or have the same experience. Why? Because it can't be considered a standalone movie and it can't be enjoyed as one. It is the top of the pyramid but you can't just land on it, you have to climb the whole pyramid first. It's a cinematic orgasm, but you have to go through the sex to get to it. It requires previous MCU knowledge, without it is just like watching the Superbowl with no understanding of the game. Many scenes, dialogues, lines, actions and choices of certain characters...won't work without it and will have less to no emotional impact on the viewer.

","This movie is so inconsistent its crazy. There is the issue of Thanos, Vision and Wanda being way underpowered until the end when Wanda is super overpowered. Pretty much every other character is way too overpowered. I think Thor is the only one with appropriate power level. Also Thanos's plan makes no sense. Why wouldn't he make more resources. He wanted to save the universe and that way he would have been a savior instead of a mass murderer. Also the half of the existing population will repopulate so this doesn't make sense as is. The ending didn't work for me. It was too obvious when they killed off all of their newest and very successful franchises that there would likely be time travel later which opens too many plot holes. Also some of the characters become morons for some reason which leads to more inconsistencies. The dumbest one was Starlord who early on was willing to kill Gamora to keep Thanos from getting her but then punched Thanos out leading to everyones death. Same with Vision. First Tony and Bruce didn't realize there was a better way to wire the infinity stone in his head. Then throughout the movie they Steve keeps saying that they don't trade lives but they are literally trading the lives of the Wakanda soldiers for Vision, a robot, in hopes they can remove the stone.

","Edit: I managed to not watch trailers or learn anything about this movie until the night I watched the film, and that made it 10000X better, though it makes me come off naive because I was not aware this was only part one of two when writing this.
I think this movie is incredibly well done, especially if if their goal is to leave me begging for more and really hit me where it would hurt. I want to start by complimenting the composer, they seamlessly intertwined their pieces into the film and it was breathtaking. The whole movie kept me on my toes and went beyond anything I could have ever imagined. At many moments I could also feel the tears start to well up, though none of those feelings compared to the complete anguish that came over me watching Peter Parker begins to disintegrate. As he scrambles to grasp onto Tony, begging that he does not want to go, though eventually disappears (proceeding as well as preceding many Avengers being whisk away in mere minutes in the film) my heart broke.
This film brought together more characters from the franchise than ever before, and although I do wish Paul Rudd and Clint Barnes would have joined in, I was thoroughly impressed by their ability to bring together so many actors.
When the credits began to roll I was quite enraged, but I give serious kudos to the creators for really going out on a limb and not following the traditional idea of keeping most of all of the main heroines alive. I was left stunned in my seat, unsure whether I could recover from the devastation I had just watched unfold. I felt the emotions of the characters and I laughed quite a bit as well.

","This is the first review I've ever written, and I think this is the perfect movie to take that spot. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time and my favorite MCU film to date. I'm a particularly big fan of how they took the character arc of Thor, I thought it was very well done. The humor felt natural to the characters, and not shoehorned in as I felt some of the jokes were in Ragnarok (also an enjoyable film, though). There were some moments of humor that didn't quite land with me, but that's okay. I also very much liked how the handled Thanos and the movie, to me, is more of a Thanos film than an Avengers film. Josh Brolin does an excellent job. There is one particularly emotional scene and I almost began to sympathize with him. Those who have seen the film will know what I'm referring to. There are many surprises and things you won't see coming. I went in only having seen one or two of the trailers, and I'm glad I did. See it as soon as you can and avoid spoilers as much as possible. It is, to me, a truly excellent film. 10/10 would recommend and 10/10 would watch again.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018
2522,18 January 2019,ethantripp,6," Marvel's ""Holy Fail""
","Costing over $300 million to make, Marvel was setting up for the biggest cinematic experience they have ever created. They had a combined budget of over $1 billion making it one of the most expensive films ever made. As a Marvel fan, these numbers make it very exciting when preparing to watch their film, but with this particular film, $1 billion wasn't quite enough.
The Avengers, including Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), Spiderman (Tom Holland), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), and many more heroes from the Marvel Universe, unite to take down their most powerful enemy yet Thanos (Josh Brolin). Thanos is attempting to collect all six of the infinity stones in his plan to inflict his will on reality. The fate of existence itself has become uncertain as everything the Avengers have ever fought for leads to this battle.
Marvel diehard or just an interested fan, everyone has a favorite superhero. When they first started the ""Avengers"" series there was an abundance of controversy surrounding the idea that pouring all those heroes into one movie would not be successful. Disregarding the hate, Marvel went straight for its intended film and created ""The Avengers"" in 2012. Grossing over $1.5 billion in earnings you could say they were right. With the pool of well loved heroes fighting side by side avengers decided to run with it, leading us to where we are now, The Avengers: Infinity War. The first problem with this film is it was clearly a shot to wring out as much cash as they could from the fan base they have created. With success of Ryan Coogler's ""The Black Panther"" and many other upcoming heroes the avengers turned into an overloaded group of heroes from all over the universe. People come to see the movies to see their favorite superhero in battle but with 500 other characters running around it draws the weight and storyline away from those specific character. It seems as if they just piled all the characters into one movie to please everyone for early box office sales.
The fact that everyone has their favorite hero, brings light to a problem with the storyline. In the film, Thanos has a goal of eliminating half of the population of the universe. Successfully obtaining the final infinity stone, with the snap of a finger, he eliminates half the population. In doing so he wipes out some pretty prominent heroes including Tom Holland's ""Spiderman"" Although Marvel did not fail to make Spiderman's final goodbye dramatic, it is still controversial. With the amazing success of the film ""Spiderman: Homecoming"" previously released, Tom Holland and the new Spiderman was gaining some steam. As a huge spiderman fan myself, it was extremely tough to see him go as it was for the millions of other fans. It is understandable to kill off a hero for dramatic purposes but why multiple characters that people come to view the movies for in the first place. Leaving Spiderman and other heroes out of the next movie could cause more people to be less exhilarated about the film.
Another problem Marvel seemed to have in their film was their weakness in capitalizing on climactic scenes. One scene that sticks out in particular and received plenty of backlash from the masses, was the battle on Titan. This battle was closest the Avengers came to defeating Thanos by taking the gauntlet and all six infinity stones off his hand. Iron man, Spiderman, Doctor Strange, and a variety of others finally knock Thanos out cold and attempt to pull the glove off his massive hand. Star Lord, a more comedic character, enters and brings his emotions to the table eventually slapping Thanos in the face and waking him up. The heroes were literally a fingernail away from saving the entire universe and succeeding in defeating Thanos. The whole entire movie led to that one intense scene and its disrupted by a more comedic character slapping Thanos in the face. Although the colors and CGI editing done on the planet Titan was impeccable, they failed to create the intended dramatic and tension filled scene of the team failing.
Although the box office numbers say otherwise, Marvel didn't provide the film millions of their fans were looking for. The Avengers isn't what it once was and seems to be a way to make money off their ever growing fan base. With their billion dollar budgets you should expect amazing scenery and technology from the movie. They lack the production of the big dramatic scenes we long for and in doing so killed off heroes people come to see in the first place.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

2546,17 May 2018,steccolandia,6," Let's make some things clear
","I had a look at like 200 reviews, and they are all rated either 9,10 or 1,2. This only shows that people hardly describe a movie objectively. Still, I believe that the main score of 8.8 is way too much, because after all, this is a superhero movie, which means easy plot, villain against the good guy/s, and good vs evil. 
Having this said, this movie was average, not bad but not brilliant. Its target is mostly teenagers or 20yo people, and gives them what they want. There is a lot of action, the story is shallow, but the writers managed to show so many characters in a balanced way. Besides being a movie almost entirely make with CGI which seems to be unavoidable these days ( and that brings away most of the acting) the ending is the part that leaves your mouth bitter. Thanos is an interesting villain, he has a purpose, that in some ways makes sense, he doesn't just kill everyone because he wants to, but in the end it is clear that soon another Marvel movie will come out and it will rewrite entirely this one, because they simply can't kill half of the superheroes. This is a classic of every superhero movie ever: the bad guy needs some artifact to become immortal/god/open a gate to another dimension, the heroes have the chance to defeat him before that but fails, and so the villain becomes God but gets defeated anyway. In this movie is the same. When I exited the cinema I was more annoyed by the fact that another movie will change everything happened in this one than the fact that the bad guy actually wins, and this made me feel that I watched a movie for nothing. I could accept this ending as it is.
People need to keep in mind that the good guys don't always win.
Anyway, as a superhero movie is ok but there are better ones, like V for Vendetta or Wonder woman, but there are others that are much worse, like Green Lantern or Black Panther. 
Another thing I should mention is that in order to watch this movie you are supposed to watch almost all the other Marvel movies, or you won't understand many scenes. This can be a good way to connect different movies, but now there are like 18 so it's too much.
I can't say much on the acting, it was ok but the CGI has the main role, and fans don't really care about it.
So to sum up this is an average superhero movie, with a great villain but a silly plot, that relies on random deaths of its characters to cause suspance, which is cheap. I only went to the cinema because I have free tickets, it is only worth the money if you're fan of the series or of special effects.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

2563,16 June 2018,andreaf-78503,," Best MCU movie yet!
","This movie is incredible!!!! It has the perfect balance of comedy, action, drama, and romance. First, the romance. The movie doesn't just include romance that characters have for each other, such as Wanda and Vision and Quill and Gamora. But also how the two teams care for each other. How Tony wants to keep Peter safe, or the friendship(or something more) between Steve and Bucky. How Thor mourns for Loki or how Gamora was willing to give up the location of the Soul Stone to save Nebula. They all have a connection to each other. An unbreakable connection. Next, the comedy. This movie was packed full of it. It wasn't too much, but not too little either. Most of it comes from the Guardians of course. How Quill envies Thor or how Drax for some reason is invisible. There's also comedy between Stark and Strange here and there. It's enough to keep us through the drama. Which brings me to the drama part. There's A LOT of drama in this movie. Lots of parts that make you want to crawl into a hole and cry for hours. Mostly, the deaths. There were multiple deaths, such as Wanda, Vision, Bucky, Gamora, Drax, Mantis, Quill, Loki(though I don't believe it), Groot, Strange, and of course, one of the most heartbreaking, Peter Parker. I cried a lot, even though we think they're not dead for good. They basically just disappeared for now. And now, the action. There were lots of action scenes. Why wouldn't there be, this is an action movie. The scene where Cap, Nat, and Sam came back or the Wakanda fight. This movie was the perfect balance of everything we love and the things we would prefer not to experience. All in all, this movie was spectacular. I give 10 stars to the Russo brothers. Good job. Hope the second part is just as good. Maybe even better. Guess we'll have to wait 'till May 3rd 2019 to find out.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

2567,1 May 2018,archiesmith,9," Marvel reaches heights of infinty, and beyond
","The definition of Marvel is ""to be affected with wonder and astonishment, as at something surprising or extraordinary"". Disregarding puns aside, 'Avengers: Infinity War' is the perfect encapsulation of its brand's namesake, as feelings of sheer 'wonder and astonishment' is what I experienced while watching the film. 
Somehow the Russo Brothers have managed to create a huge cinematic event that lives up to all the hype. This is one of the best MCU films yet, and this isn't just because of its size and spectacle. It still uses elements of the Marvel formula, so to speak, which have worked so well before, being bombastic action sequences and humorous character interactions, and unsurprisingly dials them up to 11. But then, these elements are applied and seamlessly blended with a tone which isn't exactly dark, but definitely desperate, which brings about a larger sense of danger and consequence that has never been done in one of these films before. 
While there isn't much of a plot outside of trying to stop Thanos from assembling the Infinity Gauntlet, it's the character interactions I mentioned before that Marvel usually does so well that keeps the audience captivated. And somehow, the Russos, along with screenwriters Christopher Marcus and Stephen McFeely, pull it off so well. This film has a gargantuan cast, and it manages to combine the differing tones from the various franchises without feeling cluttered. The duo of Robert Downey Jr and Benedict Cumberbatch as Iron Man and Doctor Strange makes complete sense, as their wit, sarcasm and goatees create great potential for friction and disagreement. An enthusiastic and awe-ridden Spider-Man also tags along with them, and Tom Holland makes it seem he's constantly amazed to witness the events taking place just like the audience. The campy cosmic styles of Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy mesh together exceptionally and undoubtedly deliver the best uses of comedy. And the majority of the cast from 'Civil War', along with a few other additions engage in an awesome climactic battle in the 'Black Panther' setting of Wakanda. Naturally, not a lot of these characters understandably go through much development, which was a miracle in itself to see in Civil War, but a few do. This being Hulk, Vision, Scarlet Witch, Gamora, and especially Chris Hemsworth as Thor, who has further transformed his once disengaging character until 'Ragnarok', to probably the best Avenger, who has the most legitimate reasons to be engaged in this conflict. 
But the best character is the big bad himself, Thanos. Josh Brolin delivers an incredible performance of this character, who has been built up and hyped for so many years now, and he completely subverted my expectations. He is not the loud-spoken, egotistic, emotionless monster that had been previously portrayed in his cameos, who seemed to lack any form of motivation outside of a thirst for universal conquest. Instead, he is now a soft-spoken, sardonic, charismatic but fearsome individual, who has surprisingly altruistic motives for collecting the Infinity Stones and using them for universal genocide, that actually makes reasonable sense. And because of this, he is faced with certain challenges that he has to go through in order to achieve his goals, which demonstrates the raw determination of this character that makes him all the more compelling to watch. Some of my personal favourite scenes were just dialogue between him and one other character, which effectively utilises Brolin's acting skills to show Thanos' more emotional and sensitive side, which I found more interesting, that overall creates what is probably the best comic-book villain since Chris Nolan's 'Dark Knight' Trilogy. 
The structural features on display are mainly on-point. Trent Opaloch returns as the cinematographer from the Russos' previous 'Captain America' films, but this time suitably cuts down on the shaky-cam techniques which work well with the grounded tone of those films. Instead, there is a naturally more vibrant and poppy colour palette unlike his previous dull and graded cinematography. And every shot which encompassed this is just simply gigantic, which fits greatly with the enormous stakes of the film. Alan Silvestri makes a welcome return as the composer, and while there aren't any memorable tracks outside of the recurring motifs from the first 'Avengers', the score as a whole is noticeably emotive and synchs up well with the majority of the scenes, which creates more of an aural impact than the forgettable background noise in 'Age of Ultron'. The visual effects are very impressive, especially the motion capture used for Thanos, as it effectively picks a lot of subtle facial expressions Brolin uses to perform, that make him seem all the more realistic. And while I'd say the CGI does not reach the levels of visual splendour shown in 'Guardians Vol. 2', for the most part, they successfully merge with the live action, and work as a major improvement over the PS2 graphics in 'Black Panther'. 
Despite my gushing, there are certain issues on display. I felt like the script allowed for characters to make choices and actions which were either extremely convenient or inconvenient so that the story could proceed accordingly without having to grind to a sudden, albeit logical halt. And being the nineteenth instalment in this cinematic universe, there are going to be obvious continuity errors, as I found some events in previous films, especially 'Ragnarok', did not lead into this as well as they could have. And I already mentioned the size of the ensemble cast, unfortunately, means a few characters are dismissed from having actual development, especially the other villains, Thanos' Black Order, who don't contribute much except interesting designs and opponents for the Avengers. But this is only Part 1, so I believe the few heroes who felt left behind outside of fighting will get more time to develop properly in Part 2. 
Thus, 'Avengers: Infinity War' epitomises how to culminate a cinematic universe with now a decade of history, which is not showing any signs of franchise fatigue. And yet somehow, it also manages to be a shocking, thrilling, grandiose event, where it becomes the prime example of pure popcorn cinema. This is why these films appeal to the masses, and so they should.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","I am a big Marvel fan and this movie is just so fascinating for me. I am amazed how CGI has progressed for all these years. I'll try to write this review with as little spoilers as I can so let's go.
What I particularly was the beginning of the movie. The beginning of ""Infinity War"" is so dark and the start is so shocking and just unbelievable for me to process everything so fast. The scenes are so unpredictable and it left me open-mouthed for the rest of the movie. The dark blue color prevails over every single scene and the actors did their job so perfectly.
Later in the movie, the colors start changing, from blue to red, to rainbow-ish and dark ones again. The scenes start changing quickly as the fight scenes start appearing and it is just not explainable how I felt while watching. The background music is just perfect. Alan Silvestri may be one of the best composers and I am so proud of what he did on the movie.
The ending just left me speechless as it may have left you, those are some heavy scenes for viewers and the whole cinema was basically sniffing and some were even crying. To conclude, the movie has a great number of funny scenes and I would definitely recommend it for every single movie lover.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018
2572,27 April 2018,julenpadilla,7," Surreal, immeasurable, Epic.
","There's almost no way of reviewing this movie without containing spoilers. Infinity War was everything the fans asked for, and sometimes even more. So many surprising elements and REALLY emotional scenes. The movie begins brutally by killing off Loki in just seconds. It tells you right away what kind of film this will be, and boy does it get darker throughout the way. Yes, there were MANY jokes and while some didn't land, at least Marvel finally managed to even out the jokes with the serious and emotional scenes (unlike Thor ragnarok and GOTG vol. 2). This time there wasn't some silly cringe reference or dance off when stuff was going down. Although the movie did feel a little choppy towards the first quarter, it immediately crafted itself together beautifully halfway throughout the final act. It just kept getting better and better, while getting more intense too. Whenever Thanos popped up all your attention was drawn to him. It was like Darth Vader, everyone in the room (not just in the film) acknowledged his presence and feared him. Josh Brolin by far stole the show as Thanos. His facial expressions and menace actually for once made up for a real threatening villain. Just when you thought stuff couldn't get any worse, it did. And it just kept going on and on until the whole audience got teary. Watching Thanos fight Tony gave me goosebumps, as I expected this to be the end of Tony. Everyone slowly fading away did make you lose hope. By far the most emotional scene for me was when Peter was crying on Tony while he knew what was about to happen. This movie didn't hold back at all. It was just menacing and everything hit you in the face so quickly. All the avengers showed got their moments of epicness, ESPECIALLY Thor. The end does leave many questions on everyone's minds as well as theories. But that's what makes it so good. My biggest fear with this film (apart from the potential cringe comedy) would be feeling done after IW. But nope, this just makes me want see Avengers 4 like right now. I want to see what happens next. ",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","I love the Marvel's unique conviction in its distance to ""chosen"" heroes in its strong belief and affection in cohabitation of diverse every humane heroe's affection. That includes Ironman and Spider-Man Dr.Strange Rabit Groot Gamora etc all the diverse life based on their core idea to live together in peace without fear in the universe space without violent conquer. This all star movie Avengers Infiniti War, however, or, exactly saying, that is why, teases audeiemce's strong tendency to rely on all star heroes power. Marvel, as it always does, describes the real world where killers go on killing in ""justification"" of any sorts of even in manipulation of mentality and humane strength and weakness in love and hate. Avengers Infiniti War - is exactly the world of truth seriously commuting to and diggin into reality with humour, in reflecting exactly the real world where I and all star casts or even producers directors all the Marvel studio itself facing up with in every day production process and every day life of their own. That was even shown in its reflection of the latest ""science"" to be technically implemented into real practical weapon in near future. 
And that is why this movie is ""to be continued"" in audiences' sense of sadness in the sadness (in a sense of expected even without any spoiler"" ) and asking or putting audiences into the position to think of the measures that they can do to solve the situation with production. This movie is dragging audience into the bottom of the mud where this world or areas have been sticking into.

I will rank this below their efforts in Winter Soldier, again barely. There was more espionage intrigue in that movie that was more satisfying to this viewer. But, in the current culture where superhero movie fatigue is a very real concern, and hype regarding superhero movies tends toward inflation of its true merit for entertainment, this monument should stand as a tight culmination of just about EVERY point raised and debated from the first Thor to last year's Thor.

2629,7 May 2018,arogalsky79,10," Spectacular and Jaw dropping
","Avengers: Infinity War is one of those rare movies that has an extremely unhappy ending, yet stuns and amazes you all throughout. As Marvel has moved forward with their cinematic universe, and Disney digging their massive claws deeper into the scripts to fill their quota, I was slightly nervous what would become of the Avengers movies, especially after seeing the atrocity that was Thor: Ragnorok. After that debacle I wasn't sure I wanted to continue watching any of the rest of the movies in the MCU. Thankfully Infinity War left me feeling satisfied, even with the cliffhanger ending. The Russo brothers are excellent at their job, and were the perfect choice to bring all the superheroes introduced thus far and make it action packed, dramatic, with just enough humor to keep it from going overkill. 
The other thing I liked what they did with the movie, is leave a lot of questions unanswered. With the ending of Thanos actually achieving getting all the stones and killing half the world's population, some will probably argue that's a little dissatisfactory (which who can blame them? Half the world basically vaporizes on the spot and 3/4 of the Avengers die as well, while the bad guy wins. That's not exactly the ending everyone expects). But because we know this is only the first half of the act, it leaves fans to come up with their own ideas and theories to what the second act will bring, and try to come up with their own answers to the questions left open. Something to keep us occupied until Avengers 4 is released no doubt.
Like someone else has said, I believe those who we saw physically die, with their bodies actually laying dead, I'm presuming they are for sure dead. But I don't believe the ones who were vaporized are truly ""dead"", whether they're just in another world that the living can't reach, or there's a way to reverse what Thanos did, I don't think we've said goodbye to all of them just yet, particularly Spider-Man and Black Panther, whom we've only barely been introduced to.

This is a totally different movie from anything Marvel has ever done before. First, I'll start out with the tone. This movie is dark. Marvel is sometimes criticized for being to light and happy, and I thought this was the opposite of that. Infinity War gives you a sense of hopelessness, sadness, and anger. It honestly felt like my soul was crushed, and everytime I think about the movie the feeling stays the same. Just because the movie made me feel these things, it was still great. I think that is one of the reasons you know a movie is good is that it gets you to feel these emotions about fictional characters.

","I literally cannot stand up or barely move after the end credit, not only because the excitement and stunning I had, but also this movie breaks our heart so badly. When I looked around, most people remained seated with dilapidated faces. I never felt like this after watching movies. The feeling of despair tormenting my heart. Although it is easy to anticipate probably in the next avengers, Time Stone's gonna solve this fading-way-in-the-dust massacre of super heroes, which was definitely shocking and heartbreaking for MCU funs. 
 Avengers Infinity War was the great mixture of humor and tragedy. It has a rhythm and I felt like I'm on the roller coaster, as GOG team finally encounters Avengers, Drax and Star-Load bring good taste of jokes and banters exquisitely. A lot of beloved characters die in this movie and that scene is hard to watch, but after those poignant scene, those joke scene follows to alleviate our sorrow.
 In my interpretation, it was the only way to defeat Thanos to give up Time Stone so that Tony Stark can live and this is the vision Dr. Strange saw.

","Infinity War has had so much hype surrounding it, that I was worried that it would be consumed by its own hype, and having a stereotypical ending. But boy oh boy was I wrong, Infinity War was a fantastic film that absolutely pulled NO punches or kicks. There were drastic consequences, and we'd thought we only saw the last of the deaths once Vision bit the dust, but NOPE! Thanos got all the stones, snapped his fingers, and half the universe died, along with half of the Avengers. It was an extremely sad and shocking moment, yes, but the moment that takes the cake was when Peter Parker / Spider-Man died. I was sobbing like a baby in the theater, as he's always been my favorite, and I never thought for a moment we'd see him die. But he did, and even though we all know it's not a permanent death, it sure as hell is being treated as such.
The ending, for all the heartache, was brilliant. Thanos going to watch the sunset he talked about, while smiling, was amazing. And the fact that we got no big overdone title sequence, just somber plain text over sad music, with the title crumbling away at the end.

","Infinity War is a movie that knocks it out of the ballpark. It's comedic and heartfelt, action and adventure, and it sets up Thanos as a really interesting villain, one who actually loves and cares. In his attempts to get the Soul Stone, when Thanos is required to sacrifice someone he loves, he cries and mourns after he sacrifices Gamora. Most villains are thought of to be cruel and heartless, but Thanos truly believes that what he is doing is right, and he can sway the audience to his side. Was really disappointed to see Rocket as the only Guardian alive at the end of the movie, but I don't think it is really 'the end' for the Avengers turned to ashes. Doctor Strange told Tony that out of all the outcomes, there was one that would involve them winning against Thanos. Before Strange dies, he tells Tony that, ""It had to be done"" hinting that Dr Stange knew this was going to happen and it was why he gave the stone over to save Tony's life, so he could set them on the path of winning.

","This is a very standard marvel movie. If you are not heavily invested in the characters, it will be very boring. It drags quite a bit. Many things conveniently happen solely because they advance the plot. Certain characters like Thanos and Dr.Strange have inconsistent rules concerning their powers. In some scenes Thanos can instantly disable attackers, in others he struggles for no reason other than they wanted to fit in another fight scene and some more banter or cameos. Iron man's suit is really cheesy as he can materialize different weapons out of nothing because of ""nanobots"". Again, the humor is only funny if you like the characters. Otherwise you'll roll your eyes at two bland characters bantering back and forth to no real consequence. To be fair, I did like that they didn't pull any punches with the ending but they will probably bring all those characters back to life anyway so it doesn't really matter. I did like the look of some of thanos' henchmen as well. But like most marvel movies, it is the same predictable, boring, cgi film that doesn't have much depth.

The latest edition in the Marvel canon, Avengers: Infinity War really had to do a lot to please fans because so much was riding on the hope that the movie would be successful. For starters, it would be the film that celebrated the MCU's 10th birthday (the MCU's first film, Iron Man, came out in 2008). It would also probably be the biggest crossover film ever. Bringing together every character that the MCU has ever had (except Hawkeye and Ant-Man for some reason). And it would also be the goodbye film to some of the MCU's veteran actors. It could've also easily flopped like last year's Justice League (I saw that too, it wasn't very good) by getting caught up within all of its character backstories. But it didn't. In fact, it was an amazing movie. Not as good as Black Panther, but almost. For starters, the story is very good. It's opening scene is great and pretty surprising. It doesn't waste any time introducing the main villain and getting caught up in all of the backstories. The story also isn't afraid to kill off certain characters and the ending is just an excellent cliffhanger. The story is near-perfect! Also, the characters are excellent! They are realistic and oh so badass. Not to mention very well-created and fleshed-out. And you will probably find yourself rooting for your favorite hero in the end. There is also some well-placed humor to help lighten the mode (such as ""Oh, were using our made-up names now. Okay then, my name is Spider-Man). One villain also gets roasted so badly. The performances are also great: Every actor seems to be performing to the max. The only bad part about this movie is that maybe the ending is a little too cliffhanger and that both Ant-Man and Hawkeye are left out. Other than that, everything is great. The character development is great, the action sequences are great, the mood is great, the twists are great, the moral is great, and the special effects are obviously great. Above all, this movie is another win for the MCU, a perfect way to celebrate the 10 year birthday for the franchise, and a total masterpiece that lives up to the hype! And surprises us still.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

2713,2 August 2018,robbedebruyn-85017,10," Bigger and different than any other movie
","Infinity War is the nineteenth movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, so it makes sense people expect nothing else than the same characters fighting and joking. However, this movie is so much more than that. This isn't just a typical Marvel movie. This movie brings together 23 superheroes and concludes 18 previous installments to lead to the ultimate climax: a battle with the greatest and strongest villain of all time, Thanos (who raises in my opinion to the same height as iconic villains like Darth Vader or Voldemort). Thanos is more than a villain: he is a titan with the sole purpose of making the world a better place, only in the complete wrong way. Josh Brolin delivers an astonishing performance of this character and puts more to him than just a baddy, and makes him to someone who actually cares. 
As for the superheroes, Joe and Anthony Russo perfectly managed to give every single one of them a moment to shine. Special credits go to Robert Downey Jr, Benedict Cumberbatch, Zoe Saldana, Elizabeth Olsen, Chris Hemsworth and Paul Bettany.
The movie gives us not only a ton of humor, but also some memorable though heartbreaking scenes which puts a different tone to the film than all the others. 
There is a strong build up with some spectacular action sequences (where the heroes are divided into smaller groups so that every person has his time to shine), and the film ultimately leads to an epic and amazing climax with an unexpected ending. Well done Marvel.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","This is an epic movie when it comes to CGI. Storywise it's just another superhero movie. There are so many plots going on at the same time, so many different main characters and simply false actions taking place that the movie struggles to stay on the road. 
Thors powers are back to square one (so why was there a movie called Ragnarok), Thanos sometimes can be hold in place by one avenger even with 4 stones already captured and seriously what was with the ending? Multiple characters that died, already have sequels in the making! So why even try this lame plot twist? Now everyone already knows what's going to happen next. 
Overall the movie certainly was satisfying to watch but it's highly overrated! This is not the holy grail of superhero movies.

","*Spoilers ONLY for the worst parts of the movie*
To start with you will be utterly confused,if you have not watched some of the previous movies, you wouldnt understand most of what is going on. So it is downright inaccessible to anybody who hasnt experienced most marvel films before (or at the least i recommend the knowledge of ironman, thor : dark world, avengers, avengers infinity war)
I went into endgame not expecting too much, because i knew that even if you threw all the characters into a blender ,you would still end up with a good enough movie . Thats all i ever wanted but i left the theater on a more confused note.
There were some amazing scenes but they were too few and scattered to make that much impact.
Any movie needs a good story but when you are talking about 25 + superheroes, trying to get everybody into the story is a bit too much considering the amount of screen time an average movie has. So everybody accepted it that its a great thing when we knew that the endgame was going to be 3 hours. But turns out the movie focuses so much on the actual time travel stuff. The story just dumbs down and becomes too slow. The tension element that the avengers have to get the stones back to save a universe is constantly dumbed down by throwing scenes like cap seeing his love,ironman meeting his father (and jarvis), thor meeting his mother.. comeon is this endgame or avengers : thanksgiving ? Even scenes which could have been impactful like cap vs cap are just over too quickly and nobody will remember them on the following day.
The only one necessary for the story out of these, is of ironmans and it still could have been shorter. The movie just loses its thriller element and feels like ''oh well they are just going to stroll through and collect some stones. nothing much.''
Thor is just lost as a character in this movie after they spend so many movies building him up as a character and finally gave him the love he deserved in infinity war. It feels like such a waste.
Not just Thor, Hulk doesnt get any action scenes in this movie considering they turned him into professor hulk.
And so didnt Groot. Groot has 3-4 secs of screentime
Some of the biggest and fan favorite heroes left in the dust. In infinity war, thor just slices through the kamehameha of a six infinity stone powered lvl 100 thanos and wrecks him, now equipped with both mjolnir and stormbreaker , he still cannot do anything to a normal lvl 1 thanos
I mean since ragnarok hulk has been in a fight with himself. In infinity war he just fights in ironmans hulk buster armor.I thought they were saving his big world breaker mode or something for endgame but turn out even after hearing natasha is dead, he doesnt get angry. Just tosses a table and is done. Makes no sense especially considering they gave LOADS of screen time to characters like nebula, gamora and hawk eye over whom most of us would have preferred to see the original avengers like hulk and thor smashing some aliens. And just to remind you people, the action scenes in this movie,the crux where you get to see your favorite heroes fight together in action is justtttttttttttttttttt 28 mins ... from 2:02:00 to 2:30:00 , arrival of Thanos's ship to thanos's death and that too is stretching it. yes i clocked it. The other 2 and a half hour movie is just time travel bullshit and thor crying, hawkeye ( i swear to god that guy had more screentime than captain america) and natasha ranting, going spy in the 1970s and just goofing around till the director says ,get out.
Its still a good movie, because even if they randomly showed all the characters saying bunch of stuff to each other that didnt make sense, i would still say it a good movie because thats is what a fan wants .. just to see his favorite superheroes together. There are some good jokes, few awesome fight moments.
There is so much that can be edited out and so many other heroes that needed more love and action but in conclusion, endgame is still a worthy watch for any fan.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

Over the years I've caught pieces and snippets of other Marvel movies and they weren't bad! Guardians is fun! Black Panther is cool! Then Netflix got Infinity War. We watched it on Friday night. Whaaaaat? It's so good! Today is Saturday and we just finished watching Infinity War for the 2nd time. Exciting, fun, even if you don't have much of a backstory. Good times all around.

This movie first starts from where Thor Ragnarok ended.But some people just wanted to ride the hype train so they went to see the Infinity War without a single knowledge of Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Avengers Infinity War is amazing.Thanos and his black order perfectly lived up to their hype.Get ready to see a rejuvenated form of Dr Strange,Thor and Wanda.Whole theatre was exploding during Thor's entry in Wakanda.The humour is also perfectly executed.The Wakandans including T'Challa may have a very short role but they've still managed to make this awesome.

2776,28 April 2018,bthoven66,8," Best Marvel movie since ""Civil War""
","First thing to be said, you'll leave the theater with a feeling of disappointment. How on Earth can the Avengers lose the Infinity War? Because that's exactly what happens at the end. That ultimate villain named Thanos sit and looks at the horizon thinking ""well, it's done, I finally made it"" while half of the Universe (and half of our heroes) lie dead. Not possible. That's not superheroes movies are meant to be.
Once that feeling washes off, you'll realize you just watched a great superheroes movie. It has all the action you expected for, amazing visual effects, a great soundtrack, and probably the best performances of every actor involved in a Marvel movie. The plot is not trivial but dense and deep, there's an incredible amount of characters but they work perfectly fine together, and you get really attached with some of them. Even with the villain: I heard more than a few persons saying about Thanos' motivations ""well, maybe he has a point on that..."".
I talked about performances. Josh Brolin is superb. Despite playing a CGI character, he manages to turn it into an acting masterclass. Three of the superheroines shines high too: Zoe Saldana (the best in my opinion), Elizabeth Olsen and Scarlett Johansson. Chris Hemsworth plays the best Thor I've seen. Of course the Sherlocks Duo, Robert Downey Jr. and Benedict Cumberbatch, are both magnificent. Chris Pratt, Don Cheadle, Tom Hiddleston, Dave Bautista, all of them are very well too. Bradley Cooper makes a better Rocket on every movie.
Dislikes? A few. I still don't get the idea about Groot. I'd be a little frustrated if were Vin Diesel and all I can do is say ""I am Groot"" a few times per movie. And I really don't undestand why Marvel has turned The Hulk into a comic relief. We saw Bill Bixby in the '70s series, we saw Eric Bana and Edward Norton in the first Marvel movies, and we saw Mark Ruffalo in the first two Avengers movies, all playing a complex character, struggling with his inside beast despite being superior scientists, and I still don't believe that those pitiful jokes are coming from Bruce Banner. At least, if he makes a joke, I'd like to laugh.
Anyway, it's really a good movie, undoubtly the best one from Marvel since ""Captain America: Civil War"". It's not unlikely that I go to the cinema to watch it again. I really enjoyed it. And if you saw it and you're still in pain because all of that dead superheroes, remember the last phrase on the screen: ""Thanos will return"".

And Thanos just does not look intimidating or evil. At least not like someone who is supposed to be the villain of a huge superhero movie. He seriously looked like some bodybuilder bro.
Also I hated how it seemed like they wanted us to feel bad for Thanos or sympathize with him. They used scenes of him and his ""daughter"" (someone he kidnapped after killing half her planet) and a scene of him crying (????) to make us like him? Um, no, his sole mission is to kill half the universe. That being said, I'm still confused by his motives.

Marvel and the Russo Bros have outdone themselves. They took a giant, bald, purple guy with a scrotum for a chin and a magical golden glove the size of a human head and actually made him relatable and interesting. They gave you genuine reasons to empathize with him while simultaneously giving you genuine reasons to hate him. Also, some villains have moments that show they're really cowards at heart, or that they don't have the conviction to actually carry out their goals (such as Magneto in the first X-Men film), but there isn't a hint of that in Thanos. As far as he's concerned, not only is he saving the universe -- it's his destiny to save the universe, and he's willing to do whatever it takes to accomplish that goal, even if it kills him, or he loses everything. The Russo bros have said that Thanos is the protagonist of this film, and I saw it that way throughout the movie. I never expected him to be as developed as he was. He's easily the best villain in the entire MCU -- hell, he might be the best villain I've seen in ANY movie in nearly a decade.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

This film really shocked me with some of the decisions and some of the character arks and I'm glad that it didn't go the safe route.

","I was about ready to give up on the MCU, to be honest. The villains were ineffectual, non-threatening, and the heroes triumphed every time with barely a loss. Civil War was especially disappointing to me in this regard - in the comic book storyline, the panel where Cap lies dead before Iron Man was one of the most personally impactful in Marvel comics. 
However, Infinity War does superhero movies right. It's big, it's loud, it's got enough lightheartedness so that you are still aware it's a popcorn movie based on a comic book - it's just fun. It does Thanos right, probably the most worrisome part of the film for me going in. If they couldn't make Thanos threatening, I would have stopped watching. But they did it. Whether they have the guts to stick with their decision in regards to the ending will be something else entirely, but for now, Infinity War has sated my appetite for a superhero movie.

2817,27 April 2018,sderousse,9," Did something no other marvel movie has ever done..... and they absolutely KILLED it!! BEST MARVEL MOVIE EVER MADE!!
","I have waited for so many years for these amazing marvel characters to finally work together and kick some ass. Every single fight scene was pure perfection. I was just filled with so much happiness watching these superheroes fight together. You really can't ask for anything else. FINALLY marvel has made a villain on the big screen that is actually good. Thanos is one of my favorite villains after heath ledgers joker. You see exactly just how powerful he is and crazy he is. They also bring out his emotion side for a brief minute which is something I never saw coming. He is just amazing. And the comedy!! I would give the comedy a 10. You can tell that they aren't just jokes they added in at the last minute just to add it. Seeing Tom Holland being so happy just to be there was so good you can just tell how happy he is. He and tony stark are still like father and son, and they work so well together. All the characters get enough time in the movie so they don't just feel like they were put there just because they can and it'll make them money. I will worn you however, the ending will either make you hate it and infuriate you or you'll understand just why the Russo brothers did this. You might have to take a day to process what just happened but if you understand that the ending isn't a bad thing but kind of a work of art. I give a nine because of the ending and because there are those moments when they just feel a little long and you want to see thanos punch someone in the face but they really didn't bother me that much. So, in conclusion, this is my all time favorite marvel movie and I'm gonna see it like another 4 times at least while still in theaters. I'm still just amazed on how phenomenal this movie was and that we finally get the cross over we deserve and that it is definitely not a giant flop like justice league was.

Now, my 8 stars is in real world a 7+, but that's not an option, so 8.
The movie does a real nice job of shoe horning all the different characters into it, without feeling like each characters scene was gratuitous. There is a nice amount of comedy, but not an over the top amount, like was in Thor Ragnarok. 
The Thanos character C.G.I. looks pretty good! His league of minions are typical bad guy cannon fodder. 
The numerous deaths of the super heroes in the movie is kinda sorta false b.s. though. We all know most, if not all of these passings will not take. Heck, it's all but spelled out what will happen, at least in a general sense, the next film so that all the deaths can be erased.

","Avengers: Infinity War is latest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and they have taken an unbelievable and daring step with this movie. 
Kevin Feige and The Russo Brothers have cooked up a masterpiece, which will keep you at the edge of your seat, and when you least expect, it will send you into a state of denial.
An amazing quality of this movie is how unpredictable it is, and what an amazing job Marvel did and keeping the plot a secret until the release, by handing out fake scripts to the actors and whatnot. 
The special effects, and the CGI in this movie were better than any other movie of the MCU, nothing at all seemed unrealistic (except Proxima Midnight at certain parts of the movie.)
Another one of the best things about MCU's latest installment is that although it will be a completely different experience for Marvel fans (people who've watched the movies, who read comics and in a nutshell, know everything one's supposed to know for Infinity War) compared to people who're just watching the movie for the sake of watching such a hyped release, it'll still be pretty amazing for those non-fans. Because they've made the movie in such a way that even a person who knows very less will understand what's happening.
Another amazing thing was how they portrayed Thanos. They did it the right way. They made us see his emotions, his reasons for being a genocidal purple egg. MCU has done great with their villains in their past two installments; Thanos and Killmonger. With Hela they didn't really get into depth. And they didn't really show Hela as a person, they just showed her as a mad woman killing for fun and a hunger for the throne and power. But with Thanos and Killmonger, they showed us what they went through to have these motives and aims. They didn't show them as madmen, they showed them as people. Normal people, with normal thought processes, and the ability to feel, which in my opinion is the best thing you can do with a villain; make them as human as possible.
Now we get to the quality every MCU movie has; the humor. I think this might be the best Stan Lee cameo for me. And having this ambitious a crossover is difficult, very difficult infact, but they used humor to make the characters go together perfectly. Tony Starks sarcasm, Peter Parker's movie references, Thor not knowing what to say where and Star Lord's (hilarious) narcissism all mixed in perfectly acting as comic relief scenes. 
And the last of many qualities of this movie; the daring step and breaking the cliche. This movie is not like every other superhero movie, I repeat, it is not like every other superhero movie. It's the biggest Cinematic Event in the history of cinema. And that is for a reason, not just a very grand cast, but an amazing storyline. If you have seen it, you know what 
I mean, but if you haven't....then I guess you will.
As Thanos wants things ""perfectly balanced"", that's what they did with this movie; humor, action, climax and emotion blended into a perfect balance. 
One of the best movies of the 21st Century, for me.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018
2847,26 April 2018,bigchub67,9," Marvel Studios has done it right! Congratulations on your 10 & 19.
","The 10 years of hard work, planning, and steadfast belief in their stories and movies have resulted in a catalog of superheroes movies that are not only entertaining, but resulting in a universe that has captured the imagination of the world.
And Avengers: Infinity War is epic!
It delivers on its promise and then some more surprises. For a movie of this scale, it does sacrifice some plot development for pacing, but those who have been watching the MCU are familiar with all the characters and storylines that have converged to IW.
And so the story jumps right in to the events immediately following Thor: Ragnarok.
Watching this movie on Wednesday morning 8.15am in IMAX, I was blown away by everything I saw onscreen, feeling like I was reading a comic book like a kid again.
And that is the feeling Marvel movies have given me. Especially when I see all my favorite superhero characters coming together to fight Thanos.
The Avengers were not prepared to fight such a powerful villain and because the Avengers have broken up after civil war, they lack the unity to make a strong defense against Thanos, giving him the upper hand.
And when the closing credits rolled the audience were all silent and stunned, sitting in their seats for a end credits scene and then left quietly, probably going through the movie in their heads questioning what they had watched.

I realize this is a time honored tradition that dates back to the days of the ""cliff hanger"" shows like Flash Gordon but when you are paying the money we do to see a feature film I think it is time to finish a story. Yes another reach for our collective wallets. And now the collective Marvel/Disney people will go back to all the separate stories of all the remaining heroes and we will be left wondering how it will all shake out till they reunite them for another ""Blockbuster""! At least those of us who have knowledge of the comic books have some comfort. The biggest spoiler of all so stop reading if you don't want to know. Yes, Thanos has all the stones but the ""time"" stone can basically redo all that Thanos did when he removed half of the beings in the universe. Take heart. Marvel/Disney would never really do away with any of their moneymaker characters for real.

It's a bit too long, and a a little bloated. It particularly gets a little dull in the middle. However these flaws were always going to be unavoidable for a film like this, with so many characters and tones having to mesh. That's why I say that, while the film's not perfect, it's the best it could have been. 
The film is quite funny, and all the jokes land. The action is great. Seeing the characters meet and interact is very fun. 
The highlight of the film, for sure, is the villain. Thanos is fantastic. He has a clear motivation, and real menace.

Ever since then, I have seen every MCU movie in the theater with exceptions of ""Guardians of the Galaxy 1 and 2"", ""Doctor Strange"", and Ant-Man. I saw this in 3D opening weekend. We got there an hour early and by the time the movie started, the area behind us in the theater was almost completely filled up. This was one of those big movies that are a special occasion. 2 examples are ""Marvel's Avengers"" (2012) and ""Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens"". This will be another short review, but this movie gave us the Iron Spider suit, one of my favorite Spider-Man suits, and gave us Thanos, something they've been hyping up since 2012 as a post credit scene to ""Avengers"". This is my second favorite MCU movie, and the first is ""Avengers"". I could probably see myself watching this once or twice a year.

From the incredible cast and character list, to the memorizing special effects, Avengers: Infinity War does not shy away from moments that make you rethink everything you have known about the Marvel Universe.

","I think that this film is a very fun, action packed Marvel film. Some of the action is extremely well done and special effects are on point. The relationships between the characters are very good and makes you feel for the characters which makes the deaths even more heartbreaking for the audience. Although this film is extremely good I do think it is slightly overrated. For example, the way Dr Strange can't destroy the stone because he sworn to protect it is a stupid reason to keep hold of an infinity stone and wouldn't he hide it somewhere better than around his neck? Also, the Red Skull appearing with the soul stone didn't make any sense and was a very disappointing location for the soul stone in my opinion. Thanos is a great villain who has clearly lost a lot for whatever he needs the soul stones for and loves Gamora more than anything, except the soul stone? Surely if he loved her that much he wouldn't kill her to get a stone to kill half the universe. I just didn't quite understand why he needed the stones so much and hopefully in part 2 we can find out why. ",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","Spoiler Free Review!
What an amazing and epic adventure! My only regret is not seeing it in IMAX. (I probably will) Contrary to my expectations, no characters were over done and none were wasted. A great balance of the most beloved and the ""new to the show"". This film was nothing like the ""super boring and confusing"" Age of Ultron, or the ""funny but forgettable"" Guardians 2, or the ""not as great the second time around"" Thor Ragnarok. Despite its epic scale (lots of locations and lots of characters) and loose ends it had to tie up, Infinity War was surprisingly easy to follow, and totally engaging all the way through. Fun, hilarious, emotional, action packed (with lots of real stunts and not cartoony CGI), great soundtrack and totally worth seeing more than once. The directors (the Russo brothers) may have finally dethroned ""The Avengers"" as my favorite MCU movie. Civil War is a close second, also directed by the Russo brothers. Those guys were a great addition to the MCU. Fantastic film, I can't wait to watch it again and no one spoil it for anyone!",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

He is the strongest and mightiest villain yet, so naturally, you would think, that the avengers will defead him, but that is what makes the film so special. All of the established heroes play their role and everybods gets his fair share of screen time and attention, no one is out of character and the acting is brilliant.

2941,29 April 2018,reid-54961,10," A Day in Cinematic History
","If you haven't seen the movie, scroll away now. You've been warned. Now. Into the movie I've been waiting ten years of my life for. I'm gonna go through the whole movie. First off, Loki dying was a given. If there was anything predictable at all, it was that. Another thing that might be a flaw is that Idris Elba's character dies and I wanted soo bad to feel for him, but I just simply didn't. When the story finally came down to Earth, I loved the feeling of urgency. You literally get kicked into the action and the Avengers have hardly even assembled yet and there's stuff going on in the streets! You get to see Tony Stark and Banner and Doctor Strange run through the smoky streets looking for answers to the destruction around them and they find Thanos's servants: The Black Order. If anything, they weren't much more than mini bosses you fight to get to the real deal. The fight scenes on the streets were amazing (as with all of them in this movie) and it was a great introduction. Back on Earth, Scarlet Witch, Vision, Banner (Because the Hulk is scared to awaken since Thanos beat the green out of him), Captain America (Now, Nomad), Black Panther, Winter Soldier, War Machine, and Falcon prepare for an attack on Wakanda, all the while, trying to remove the Mind Stone from Vision's head. If I had a problem with any of that storyline, it is that it was a little rushed into. Something I loved however, was Thanos. This was his movie, almost more than the Avenger's. He is so fleshed out and you understand his motives. He really is doing what he truly believes is right. He is, in fact, the ""mad titan"". He has got more story, more emotion than ANY villain Marvel has thrown at us. He even kills his own daughter just to get the Soul Stone. And while we're on that subject: Red Skull is ALIVE. I just knew he wasn't dead back in the first Captain America movie. Back to Thanos. Throughout the movie you learn to hate this guy with such a passion. He is literally the most powerful being in the universe and you feel it completely. While the movie is going on you have this sense of dread. That something is coming, that some eventual threat is gonna make it's appearance. Now let's talk about a sensitive subject. When Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, and half the Guardians of the Galaxy actually have Thanos pinned down.. and then StarLord finds out that Gamora is dead and literally screws half the universe. They have the Gauntlet almost off of him, but Quill let his love and anger get in the way. I, for one, am not mad. In the moment, he was angry and blinded by rage. He lost his mom, had to kill his dad, and now another person he loves has died and he couldn't do anything to stop it. He was acting on his gut and it cost a giant price. In that same fight sequence, Iron Man is fighting harder than you've ever seen him fight before. He is punching and creating shields and his armor is tearing. And then Thanos stabs him, and I honestly thought that was it. I was about to be in tears as my favorite hero was about to die. And then Doctor Strange offers the Time Stone for Tony's life. Some people have a bone to pick with this but I believe it's all a part of Strange's bigger plan. Earlier, on Titan, he went through so many timelines to see if their outcomes and they only win one. And then at the inevitable ending, he tells Tony, ""It was the only way."" Showing that he had to make this sacrifice to have the eventual victory. Peter Dinklage was the dwarf at the birthplace of the Infinity Gauntlet and Thor's Hammer and it was a little awkward to see him that way but I was fine with it. Also Thor's new axe (and eye) is amazing. The Wakanda fight scene was, like I said, rushed, but ended up showing some amazing fight scenes, such as: Captain America and Black Panther running and fighting side by side, or Scarlet Witch showing off the true power of her abilities. And when Thor came down with his new axe, he obliterated tons of those weird dog-like aliens. And it almost feels like they are actually winning.. and then Thanos shows up. Thanos is here for the last Stone and with 5 already, he is unstoppable. It was hard to watch as literally almost every Avenger hurled themselves at him and he merely flicked them away like flies. Before he can get to Vision, Scarlet Witch destroys the Mind Stone.. only for Thanos to rewind time and rip it out of Vision's skull. As his body fell limp and grey, I could only imagine was Scarlet Witch was feeling. The one thing I didn't expect was when Thor almost killed him. I thought to myself, ""Hey, this could be a good enough ending."" And then Thanos wins. He snaps his fingers and half the universe dies just like that. And the big deaths begin to happen. All of the Guardians die, except Rocket, and he even had to watch Groot die in front of him. Bucky dies as Steve Rogers falls to his knees and is literally speechless to see his best friend turn into ash. Black Panther dies (which through me for a loop). Then Falcon and some of the Wakandans die, along with Scarlet Witch herself. I think the most heart wrenching moment was when Spider-Man began to fade away. He literally grabs onto Tony, his mentor, and begs for his life. He tells him that he's not ready to go, and Tony has to sit there as he dies in his arms. I still can't believe Marvel did that. They actually killed around 14 characters in the span of two and half hours. And 10 of them were in the span of 15 minutes. It was horrifying to watch these heroes die off one by one. For the first time, the villain wins. For the first time, I don't know what to expect to happen next. Half of the roster just died and it's too much to comprehend. This is the most serious, beautiful, and high stakes movie Marvel has ever created. The credits feel like an obituary to those who were lost. This movie was indeed a Marvel Epic, and I can and cannot wait to see what happens next year in Avengers 4. And on the end credit scene: I can't wait for Captain Marvel. This movie broke me, put me back together, and then tore me apart again. I love and hate this movie.

However what I don't understand is why they used so much CGI for Thor's lieutenants? It felt like going from a game when looking at them to a movie when looking at the Avengers and the rest. The lieutenants were excellent creations in their concepts but I didn't like the final computerized, animated cartoon feeling. It didn't jive with the rest of the movie in this way. The Hulk almost feels this way sometimes but not to the same extent.

Thats just sums him up, rest of the movie is good, but expected more to be honest. There were many mistakes in CGI (in 20018), and saw better visuals two Avengers ago.

Every single film felt like it was leading to something bigger, and this was it and it delivered better than I ever could have imagined. Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus once again do a fantastic job with the screen play. I was amazed at how well they were able to balance every single character. Most characters don't have more than 10 minutes of screen time but everyone has a moment to shine, their presence feels much bigger. I really think credit is deserved for Thanos, everything about him. Josh Brolin does fantastic in this role; he is the best villain in a superhero film since the 2008 Joker. The CGI on him was also flawless. The visual and sound effects were superb in general. I was a bit worried about that after Black Panther which had mediocre CG, but this film looked excellent.

","While I am a fan of comics I never was of its cinematic counterpart because almost always movie producdion houses and directors were not brave enough to adapt the movies like they were in the comics or close nough, in fear of not capturing the attention of the normal movie going masses. These last 16 movies by marvel decided to take a brave step in the right direction and expand on the comic universe in order to adapt some of the amazing and complex story lines from the comics. All 16 movies prior infonity wars led to the Infinity gauntlet event and slowly built up the plot for it in the backround of each movie. And finally with Avangers: Infinity War one of the most iconic battles in the marvel universe was fantastically adapted on the big screen. Avengers: Infinity War is the best movie of its genre, and the best comic adaption along with The Watchmen. I urge every Comic fan to watch this movie and be absolutely blown away. It blew all my expectations trough the roof!",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","My goal here is not to get you not to see the movie. You're going to see it anyway. It's just to help you manage your expectations. 
Do you remember the first scene in the first 'Toy Story' movie when, as part of an internal dialogue, Woody's owner says 'I brought my attack dog with a built-in force field. Well I brought my Dinosaur, who eats force-field dogs?' Well, that's the level of writing in Infinity Wars. Only they mean it. Super powers have gotten to the point that anything can be anything else. The, by now, run-of-the-mill avengers powers are simply no match for for Thanos and his buddies. And yet, the avengers find completely unexplained ways to defeat some of the minions. Nothing. Makes. Sense. Even within the context of the movie. Things just happen. Some good, and some bad. Everything is at apocalyptic scale. Huge set-pieces are inter-spliced with other huge set-pieces, and all of it really to no avail. Any interaction between characters is simply short-hand. When everything is at such a large scale, you don't give a rat's ass who lives and who dies. Or what happens. If you just want a catalog of special effects, this movie is for you. If you still have an appetite for story, character development, and chemistry, lower your expectations.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

1. The give Thanos damn stones. Why TF they cannot sacrifice 3 characters to save a bunch of others, nevermind trillions of creatures among the universe?
2. They killed all NEW characters.

2973,26 April 2018,woziak,8," It's Divisive but brilliant in its execution
","Just got out of watching this movie in Imax 3d and although I love this film, it will have some negativity simply because it involves so many characters and only 2hr 36 minutes to tell the story. Ok let's start, the first act starts at a frantic pace just after the events of Thor Ragnorak and we instantly find out Thanos malevolent intentions, he wants all the 'infinity stones' to balance the Universe by wiping out half the Universe's population. After this showstopping first Act we are whisked off to New York where Dr Strange meets Spiderman and Iron Man for the first team closely followed by Hulkless Dr Banner. Thanos, Knowing that Dr Strange and vision has two of the stones on earth first heads to 'knowhere' from the GOG franchise to pick up the third stone from the collector drawing out Gamorra who is critical to the main and sub plot of the film, after using the reality stone to defeat The GOG he now tries to locate the 4th stone, the Soul gem which is hidden to all but one, before he will venture to earth to collect the final 2 stones. Thanos sends his children , 'The Black Order' to locate and find the two stones while he searches for the most difficult. During this rollercoaster of a ride that at times feels so similar to the cut scenes of the DC injustice movie, Thor meets the Guardians, then with Rocket and teenage Groot journies to the planet of the Dwarves to forge a new hammer called ""Stormbreaker"". All this is happening while Capt, Falcon, Black Widow rescue Scarlet Witch and Vision from the black order and then seek refuge with War Machine in Wakanda. 
 Also concurrently in the film we see Iron Man, Spider Man and Dr Strange hitch a lift to Titan, homeworld of Thanos where they meet the GOG all intent on stopping Thanos reaching Earth to collect the final 2 stones. Ok as you can see the plot is so fast there is no time to pause for breath and this is where some of the critics will have a field day but the film achieves its goals with brilliant pacing, fight scenes, special effects and great moments for all our heroes and villains alike and some stunning shocks that leave you gasping and exhilarated both at the same time. The ending is brilliant but you know especially with the aftercredits scene that the franchise simply can't end this way so Avengers 4 will be another must watch movie!! 
 Joss Brolin is rightly getting plaudits for his portrayal of a wonderful villain but for me, he's only the 2nd best in the MCU, behind Killmonger and still a distant 3rd in Comic book movies behind Heath Ledger's Joker, netherless his brilliant emotional arc of the character and in paticular Thanos relenting unerving motivation is what elevates the film to top 5 in the MCU behind Winter Soldier, Black Panther, Avengers 1 and Civil War.

","Avengers: Infinity War is more than an epic, a masterpiece, an emotional ride, visual extravaganza and cinematic excellence. Infinity War is a dream come true for Marvel fans from all over the world. Infinity war is not just a cinema, it's an experience, 3 years of await, 10 years of exceptional journey and 18 movies of long thread lead to this. Everything about Infinity war is spellbinding and mind boggling. Hats off to the Russo Brothers(Anthony and Joe Russo) for bringing Infinity war into life and meeting up to the fans expectations and the hype, their vision is extraordinary, you will know once you see the movie, how great their direction was and characters build up. They just nailed it. Half of the total credits must go to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for the amazing screenplay. The movie starts off with Thor: Ragnarok's post credit scene and ends up with ""end of everything"". Right from the word go, every scene was intriguing,engaging and thrilling. Every superhero in the movie has got their own space to showcase their powers and skills, you will scream for every scene, I promise, even if you are not a fan of a particular superhero, you will surely scream for their elevations. There are many sacrifices in this movie which are quite emotional and they are so meaningful. Even the mad titan himself has to sacrifice something to gain something. Thanos is not just a villain, he has his own character which has a lot of emotional depth. You will feel sorry for him in few moments which causes so much pain to him. His life, his children, his sacrifice and his goal everything means so much to him. He also respects his opponents even though they took out the blood from his face. Thanos says ""I hope they remember you"" to Tony, this scene is just awesome and you are gonna love it for sure. Josh Brolin is spectacular in Thanos role, he completely nailed it. Thanos' adoptive children Cull Obsidian, Ebony Maw, Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive helps him to fill the infinity gauntlet with six infinity stones. They also had few outstanding moments in this movie. There will be a heartbreak in the first 5 minutes of the movie, so, one should not miss the beginning. Heimdall's uses bifrost one last time to save Hulk and succeeds by the way. The scene in which Bruce Banner warns Dr. Strange by saying ""Thanos is coming"" is striking. Dr. Strange seeking help of Tony Stark is an another moment to cherish by Marvel fans. Scenes involving Peter Parker, Tony Stark and Stephen Strange were remarkable.
The entrance scene of Steve Rogers is breathtaking, Captain, Widow and Falcon rescues Vision and Wanda Maximoff from Midnight and Glaive. And also the scenes involving Thor, Rocket, Groot, Mantis, Gamora, Drax, Star Lord were picturesque. The king, Black Panther opens the door for the trouble and evil, he never hesitates to help ""all of them"", even if Wakanda destroys, he wouldn't care because he is the king.
The entire action sequences pictured in Wakanda and Titan are jaw-dropping. Climax of the movie will leave you baffled and so was the post credits scene involving Maria Hill and Nick Fury. That was the best time to call ""Captain Marvel"" to the scenario. Be prepared for the heartbreaks in the climax, they were too emotional.
On the whole, Avengers: Infinity war is a movie which will be cherished and remembered for a long time, like even for few decades or so. Infinity war is nothing short of an epic. A masterpiece. MARVEL-ous one from the Marvel Studios. I'm not going to disclose spoilers in my review, just go and experience the epic. We have to wait until May 3rd, 2019 to see how the mystery unfolds.

I don't understand, yes some of the characters that were dusted we'll know will be back because they've more films announced but seeing the deaths of some of them during the dusting scenes were still an emotional gut punch, anyone who wasn't moved by Tom Holland's acting during his death scene have to be emotionless morons!
There have been 18 films in the MCU prior to this not as some have said 31! All those prior 18 films have had plot threads going into Infinity War. Thanos is the best villain Marvel has had in all their MCU films and Josh Brolin even in motion capture/CGI still made Thanos an interesting character who in his own twisted way did what he did for the right reasons. Part of the problem I think some reviewers had was the number of characters who had more or less screen time than they thought they deserved, and yes we know most if not all the characters who were killed will probably be back by the time the credits roll in Avengers 4 but this doesn't distract from the steller job the directors & screenwriters have done with such a huge story and cast. Believe the more genuine reviews rather than the overly critical ones, at least Marvel know how to make a superhero film work which is more than DC/Warners are doing with their films (I thought bringing Josh Whedon in to tidy up Justice League would help but unfortunately it didn't).

","Perfect movie for a marvel fan. As a fan who has watched all the previous movies and has followed the franchise, I can say that this movie has very much exceeded my expectations. This movie is packed with very emotional scenes, humour when appropriate, great action and an amazing storyline. What I didn't expect was how they portrayed Thanos by showing an emotional side to him unlike most supervillains. I had goosebumps all over me during some scenes because they were just so well-directed and just straight-up cool. I would've given it a ten except I thought that the way they killed off Loki was totally unheroic. 5 minutes into the movie and Loki is strangled to death without any sort of a memorable ending. I know how the directors wanted to be bold and kill off some characters but really? Heimdall's death was not in vain as he did something heroic before he died. Also Gamora's death was very emotional so, no complaints. But Loki, as a fan-favourite character, should have been given a memorable death. That's my only complain with the movie. Other than that, mind-blowing movie and can't wait for the next part.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

They showed how Thanos was a being, yes he is a Titan but he is a living thing that could die if he was stabbed or shot in the right place.

","After 18 films in the making it has all lead to this. An epic showdown of cinematic proportions on a scale that will never be replicated. The Russo's dons great job at juggling each band of hero's as they try to stop the mad titan. One of the best directed senes was the first big reveal of the black order in New York. The opening is cold and horrifying letting the audience learn how truly powerful Thanos is with just one stone.
Thanos is an awesome villain that is both powerful and sympathetic. He doesn't have a lady death like in the comics. His motivations are set out and make sense as a whole and Josh Brolin's performance is awesome and in my opinion Oscar worthy. 
The supporting cast as well is nothing to scoff at. They all support the main groups in a good way and each getting time to shine. An outstanding performance comes from Paul Bettney who is amazing in the role and plays off Elizabeth Olsen very well and makes their love more real. He in my opinion turns in an amazing performance that again I feel is Oscar worthy. He shows a wide range of emotion that effects the audience. Chris Pratt has an amazing moment with Zoey Zeldana and his duty to the one he loves. There are so many emotionally charged moments that effect the viewer well after you walk out of the theater. Though the ending is a little down for some unprepared viewers it still doesn't detract from the spectacle and scale the movie is on. The film demonstrates how low our heroes can go and the stakes that were there. Even one of the last lines is depressing yet hopeful. The film is a marvel (no pun intended) of cinematic and storytelling spectacle and how to pull off a great 3rd act of your series.
Though sometimes slow and characters lacking in substance and reason for being there it still is a great film that is one part emotional and another a war that lives up with its name.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

In such films, once the initial shock dissipates, there's little left to warrant rewatching, but it does encourage patrons to flood the box officer earlier than later. I suspect the studio push admonishing early moviegoers to avoid spoilers and inciting the hashtag movement, ""thanosdemandsyoursilence"", was likely a calculated tool to drive the hype.

","Infinity War was clever. Endgame is just silly. You could write a novel about all that is wrong with it, but let's mention the most glaring examples:
1. Time travel. Never use it as a plot device. It becomes dumb, and removes any sense of consequence. It is basically a reset button. And Endgame takes the price for amount of self contradictions when clumsily making use of it.
2. Thanos was an interesting character in IW; here he is just a cartoon villan.
3. Everything with Thor. Ragnarok identified him as a true god of thunder; the hammer was just to focus his powers. And now suddenly Steve Rogers can call lightning?
4. Political correctness. Cap's main motivation for several movies has been his old pal Bucky, but now at the end it's suddenly black wing guy who gets the final moments with him and takes over the shield? I guarantee that was NOT the original plan. There's lots of PC in the movie, but this is the most glaring example. Another grating example is the whole presence of Captain Marvel; over-powerful, and yet useless.
5. Humor. In IW it was clever. Here it is mostly reduced to fart jokes.
6. Don't just copy yourself, Russos. The soulstone sacrifice in IW was moving. Here I could not care less.
7. Thanos, again. In IW a handful of Avengers almost defeated him when he had the glove and most of the stones; they only failed because of the emotional stakes (again, clever). Thor bested him after he got the whole thing. And in Endgame the whole lot of them, including supergirl cannot get in a good punch when his only weapon is a big axe?",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

Writers break the narrative into several branches, which develop in parallel, so the lack of dynamics is not felt from the word in general. At the same time, four to six story arches can occur and in an unprepared spectator the head can naturally go around. All the meaningful scenes after the credits of the films released over the last ten years that moved the meta-story of Marvel, are suddenly gaining meaning and developing exactly as if everyone has already been aware of what is happening. This forms a rather high entry threshold, to which many viewers, especially those who do not follow kinomics, will simply not be ready. But even without preparation the film looks great. Yes - you will not be aware of 80% of the dialogues, but you will be provided with the most powerful spectacle. A separate pleasure from viewing is the interaction of previously unseen characters.

","This movie is truly phenomenally astonishing. It will make you laugh, cry, break your heart and will it will keep you intense throughout the entire movie. The ending of the movie is very smart and is such a cliffhanger however, I do have faith in the Russo brothers in what their doing with the MCU. One of the biggest and best plot twists in any superhero movie takes place here in infinity war. It is when Thanos and Gamora go to a certain planet to get the soul stone and are greeted by what we think is death and the turn out to be the red skull. Later on in that scene Thanos sacrifices Gamora for the soul. This scene shows how ruthless he is and how he will stop at nothing to get what he wants. In the film we are shown a different type of Thanos the comics. We see Thanos as a ruthless mass murder who will stop at nothing, and we then feel sympathetic towards him in certain scenes. The ending of the film is truly confusing, I say this because Thanos gets all the infinity stones on the gauntlet and snaps his fingers. We then see and alternate reality where everything is destroyed. We then return to our reality, we then see every hero in the movie apart from Captain America, Iron man, Thor, Black widow, Hulk, war machine, rocket raccoon and okye (the original phase 1 avengers and other heroes) turn into ash and disappear (this does not mean their dead but, they have disappeared). We then see Thanos in most likely another planet sitting down without the infinity gauntlet with a smile on his face. A young Gamora then comes to confront him. She says to him ""what did it cost"" Thanos then reply's saying ""everything"" the film then cuts to black. The end credits scene shows Nick fury and Maria hill in a car. A car the crashes in front of them they then go to look at who's inside, it turns out that nobody was driving. Maria hill then turns into ash just before we see a helicopter crash to the ground. Nick fury takes out a retro looking device and says ""this is code red"" he turns on the device. Just while it's pending Nick fury turns into ash just before he finishes his sentence. After he disintegrated the device is finished pending and shows the captain marvel logo. This is meant to show that after her solo movie Captain marvel will return in avengers 4. The film then cuts to black and instead of showing ""the avengers will return"" as avengers movies usually show it says ""Thanos will return"". This is meant to show that Thanos will comeback and it will be a much bigger battle/movie than this one was. Overall this is a phenomenal movie and I strongly recommend everyone to go see it.

","At the moment, marvel cinematic universe has 19 movies. Whether you like them or not, they create an important part of modern cinema. These movies bring a huge number of people to cinemas. Some of these movies are incredibly original and creative, some are not. But they all represent a pop culture of the twenty-first century. In the twentieth century, the Avengers were cowboys. An example of real space cowboys are the Guardians of the galaxy. Throughout almost the entire first film, each of the Guardians pursued only personal interests, just like cowboys do in most movies. Or the actions of Spider-Man I associate with Shane from the 1953 movie. Turning to the new film, I want to say that I like Marvel, like their characters, their ability to inspire children. But I also like a good movies and a few of the latest movies of the cinematic universe are disappointed me with a weak script and focusing on visual effects. Infinity War I liked much more. There are a lot of characters in this movie. A lot. Some of them reveal themselves on the new side, they surprise with their abilities. But there is one character, which is more interesting to watch than all the others, his name is Thanos. In each scene where Thanos is present, you can watch his motivation, his rage, his ability to love and kill. From the first minutes viewers are given to understand that this movie will be much darker than all the past, that this movie is not afraid to kill the heroes. Everything that happens in the movie reminds an incredibly expensive theatrical production. The heroes understand that they don't want to die and see the death of those who they love because of the genocide of Thanos. Thanos himself and his hunting for stones resemble Disney and how they buy more and more studios. In conclusion, I just want to quote the dialogue between Thanos and Gamora at the end of the movie.

3139,27 April 2018,chrismylo,8," An extraordinary cinematic experience
","I couldn't be more shocked by a movie. My heart was beating so fast from minute one until the last minute. My legs were shaking after leaving the theater.
It is a thrilling ride with ups and downs (mostly downs). Many people say that it is exhausting because there are too many characters and too many things going on, but you cannot criticize this movie from this factor only. This is the movies nature. It was meant to be like that, to exhaust you until the last minute. On the other hand, there were too many characters but each and every one of them is shown equally with an enormous dynamic for all of them. Also, the scenes that were running simultaneously were masterfully crafted to fit in the story so that everything can end up the way it ended. 
Yes, there were many deaths and many of those deaths made us cry and made us emotionally unstable. But this is the movie, a movie about the possible end of the world. 
Thanos is the best villain that Marvel ever created. He threw Killmonger out of the window. We've seen an extraordinary part of his character. He is not the bad villain that everyone was waiting for. We've seen his good side in many perspectives, his only love. But we've seen what he is capable to do to accomplish his mission.
At last what Avengers: Infinity War has that no other superhero movies has is that ending. Those 10 last minutes that will haunt you forever and you will never forget them. Things take an unexpected turn at those 10 last minutes that you are not only left speechless but you leave the theater with your mouth fully open from surprise and your legs shaking from disbelief. 
It's of course the first part of a two part movie because it leaves you with an enormous cliffhanger but let's not forget May 2019 is not too far away from now.
Thus, this movie is a must see for all the marvel moviegoers and fans but also for people that have some knowledge on the movies background story. The cast and crew of this movie deserve a big applause and an enormous bravo from the entire world. I cannot believe that I've lived to see this movie.

I think, this movie has created it's own level. It's too much hard to create such an hype, make this the talk of the time and then serve even better than those! The only thing that disappointed me is Thanos! I thought I will see him as powerful as the comics but he wasn't actually like that. But it's ok, that was necessary for the movie. In comics we see characters like Doom, Galactus, Sentry, Living Tribunal but in that movie they were not present to stand against Thanos! So it was needed to reduce his power so that our heroes can do something. But it wasn't actually a problem. We got the chance to see how wise he is even without the destructive powers. This is how you should create a villain character, who has a strong will and a good heart. DC should learn a lesson from this, they should know that people won't accept villains like horrible stephenwolf.

","When I was going into this movie, I was kinda scared that I would be a disapointing movie. I was SOOOOOO WRONG!!!!!!!! The 10 year build-up for this movie was entirely worth it. Every character got a shot on the spot ( well not really the Black Panther characters cause we saw them in their movie). And in this movie, everyone's a badass (especially Thor). And this movie was filmed entirely off of IMAX cameras and that gives a huge advantage to this movie over all the movies because this entire movie is huge. And the action. OMG the action. This is the best action i've seen in a superhero movie and it's so exciting, destructive, and intense. But the main reason why I love this movie so much is because of-none other than-Thanos. He's literally the Darth Vader of Marvel villains. He has so much cinematic depth put in his character that even though he was a evil guy you gave a damn about him throughout the movie. And he had the most screentime out of all the characters in IW. And this movie had lots of emotion put in Thanos' character too. Like when he had to kill Gamora to get the Soul Stone, when he was crying, you wanted to cry with him also. And his motivations to get the Infinty Gauntletmade a lot of sense. They were cruel but they made sense. And this movie leaves you on such a cliffhanger ending that you can't wait for the next Avengers movie to come out which everyone is talking about. And lastly, don't listen to the haters for this movie. They're either drunk, high, DC biased or people that hate superhero movies. Do me a favour, buy it on Blu-Ray in watch it.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","Avengers: Infinity War does an incredible job of melding together many storylines and characters into a beautifully intertwined story that's not even hard to follow. It does everything previous MCU movies have done, but on a much grander scale. The villain Thanos is especially compelling and has really done justice to all the times he's been hinted at since Avengers Assemble. This movie has it all - sci-fi, drama, fantasy, comedy, and action, so I'm sure all audiences will like something about it. The acting was pretty good across the board but since everyone had limited screen time (even in such a long movie!), what really stood out to me was the amazing visuals, and of course, the very long story arch finally coming near an end. The ending is also exceptional, but I won't speak much about that.

But brothers russo created an amazing movie with deep, emotional story that the last 10 has led to, with over 30 characters they created a stable running plot that does not stop for a secound. Thanos is one of cinema best bad guys ever with a real agenda and complex conflicts that make it very complicated to not agree and the deep of the character made Thanos-the villain to movie main character and he is the one who gives the tune for the movie.

It hasn't got a basic 3 part storieline and it doesnt introduce any of the heroes. This movie focuses more on introducing and following the villain. You heard that right, Thanos is the lead character in this movie. It is more a Thanos movie than an Avengers movie, and that is what makes this movie as great as it is. It is not your standard superhero movie and definitly not your standard marvel movie. Finally marvel has a great villain. Also the humor is on point in this movie and the avengers are great as always. In my opinion thor is my favorite avenger in this movie and his character has the most development of all the avengers. I gave this movie a 10/10, but i have to honest and say that i am a bit of a mcu fanboy. I think that if you like marvel movies in general you won't be disapointed, but if you have never liked marvel movies than this movie won't change your mind and you should better go and see another movie.

","Read through some of the reviews and, as someone has previously stated, it's beyond comprehension (and human reasoning) to downvote this movie for the stupidest reasons (no more superhoeroes movies, no plot, everybody dying, too much violence, etc.).
This is IT, it's the most epic movie in the MCU. 
From Stan Lee's one-liner (brilliant guy, don't care what others say about him) to Thor's shocking self sacrifice, this has been nothing short of EPIC. 
For me, if I were to choose a particular moment in the movie that moved me, it would have to be the arrival of Thor on Wakanda (builing up after the heart-melting moment of self sacrifice to get that Stormbreaker, with much needed sacrifice from the grumpiest Twig ever).
All in all, an advice for people out there:
> If you have seen the MCU movies until now, this is the cherry on top - part1, ergo, a MUST SEE.
> If you haven't seen the MCU movies (or seen just few of them), be open-minded, and give it go.
And remember, 2019 will bring us Cherry on top - part 2 (with the highly anticipated appearance of Adam Warlock, Captain Marvel and ... the Soul Stone).

","The Russo brothers have done it again. The movie was paced very well, with the directors giving us breathing room between action heavy scenes for emotional moments & character growth. The comedy was also on point. The to and fro between the characters were perfectly timed & executed. The only gripe i have with the movie is the absence of 2 key characters. I was initially worried that wakanda parts would be given too much screentime (as i am not a fan of the overrated plothole heavy black panther) thankfully the scenes in wakanda were few. The Space sequences involving Thor & the Guardians were very well done. And finally Thanos is the best marvel villain since Loki & Red skull, who also makes his long awaited return with a cameo. The ending was anticlimactic but in a strange way fulfilling too, With what has transpired, I'm hopeful that we'd not be visually & culturally tortured with a black panther sequel anytime soon. this movie has dethroned Winter Soldier & is now my 3rd most favorite superhero movie ever after The Dark Knight & Civil War. The best part why Avengers succeeded & justice league failed was because Marvel doesn't waste time with SJW nonsense in their movies. (Atleast not all of them). I give this 9/10 stars.

","Just returned from the cinemas after catching the all new ""Avengers: Infinity War"" flick! And my oh my this installment was quite intriguing, all personalities and events in the film intertwining seamlessly into one cosmic universe and it was indeed incredible to witness and behold. Thanos as a villain is monstrous and intimidating with menacing disposition amongst an eloquent hyperbolic parlance. I found the mumbo jumbo regarding the nature of the universe rather mystical and quasi-Buddhist with subtle quantum overtones reminiscent of Oxford colleague chatter. The action doesn't disappoint either, with karate warrior-like combat scenes and mesmerizing space expeditionary incursions. The pace of the movie is never boring with plenty of funny comedic lines and dialogue. The integrating of all the characters from differing Marvel universes brought an eclectic vibration of diversity akin to a kind of balancing act of hormonal chemistry within the egocentric network. And good lord are Scarlet Witch and Gamora hot as fsck must I say. The element of realism and CGI prowess doesn't disappoint either.. Worlds and civilizations apart envisioning want of utopian resplendence and splendor. And The Hulk and Iron Man are f-in hilarious as toast rofl, with even each single Marvel character exuding a very vibrant distinct persona and aura in impressions formed.

","A truly disappointing cinema viewing. This was hyped to be the big movie of the year but was flawed in too many ways.
I've had some hours to think how it was a disappointment and thing these are the key ones for me.
The difference in humour and relism between GoTG and the earth characters became so obvious, it make much of the movie feel unreal.
It became obvious from an early stage that the time stone would be used and at some point lots of killed characters will come back in due course, this obvious plot line meant there was no feeling of meaning to the story.
The sheer number of characters running and punching on screen and a serious lack of meaningful dialogue made it hard to invest in the storyline or the interactions on screen. In fact thanos became the most likabile character during the movie as he had the best lines and most development

Some of the scenes occur on different planets, in space, and on a spaceship. So when you complain about this movie having too much visual effects, unfortunately you just failed to understand the movie itself. Now to address the complaints about the lack of character development, if you knew anything about character development, these characters developed from different movies, Captain America in Captain America: the first avenger, Ironman in the first Ironman movie, formation of Guardians of the Galaxy in their own movie, Dr. Strange from his own movie and all the sidekicks were all introduced on other Marvel movies so all these characters are well developed. Avengers Infinity War was never made to develop characters, it is the culmination of these characters to fight a super villain.

Firstly for Superheroes movies - there are minimum 2 kinds of audience
1. One who have read those comics and have high anticipation of the characters
2. One who have watched the movies but not the comics, yet have high expectation of the movie
And maybe a bit of both...
Regardless this movie was a Highly anticipated, Awaited, High expectation movie for the Super hero genre.
So how does it stand?
Do read on...
For the record I belong to the 1 type audience, I grew up reading the super hero comics- both of Marvel and Dc so I am aware of the power and the character of the heroes.
The review is strictly of Marvel - characters of this movie.
To begin== A kickass- Blockbuster movie
Like I always mention a Super hero is made a hero based on the villain and the tasks that they undertake and accomplish.
The villain has to be good and strong. 
Does the Villain - have that impact- a strong YES, an exceeding expectation characterization of 'Thanos' as the villain.
All the trailers have not let down the character of Thanos in the movie.
He is a Granddaddy of all super villains- thus far. Exceeding expectation of the villain role. He is impeccable and portrayed as a super villain to perfection. No flaw in his characterization. 
Perfect fit a Super villain? >> 
Does the movie have flaw/cons - Yes, but do they impact the outcome of the movie - No Sir, The flaws are at minimum to negligible - only if you strictly try to find them, will they feel so.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018
3347,3 May 2018,andrewtomneilson,9," Infinity War The Most Intense Marvel Movie Yet
","Marvel's Infinity War is the most complex and intense movie of the Marvel Universe. This film with its numerous heros may seem pretty challenging to follow if you're not a hardcore Marvel fan. However, even though there were 19 movies before this one, Infinity War did a fantastic job of bringing all the movies together into a plot that even a first time Marvel movie watcher could understand and enjoy. As said before Infinity War, movie number 19 of this connected movie franchise, has brought all of their heros and movies together seamlessly into an all out war against one very powerful super villain named Thanos. It's very entertaining to see how the groups of heros interact with one another. Black Panther and Captain America gives the viewers someone to look up to and respect. Dr. Strange and Tony Stark's egotistical outlook on themselves really make a good comedic relief between the many intense fight scenes. The biggest comedic relief however comes from the Guardians of the Galaxy ranging from their old music classics, to their funky way of running their operations really gives the audience something to laugh about amongst the chaos, the chaos of course being Thanos. There is so much background to this villain's rise for power so I'll sum it all up for you. Thanos is on a quest to find 6 gems. Each gem, even though they look like something out of a bedazzling kit you got when you were eight, hold very powerful and specific powers that ultimately will let him kill off half of the universe's population. This is the biggest, baddest, and scariest villain yet, not just because his goal is to wipe out half of the universe's populace, but because he is convinced that he is the good guy. He believes that he is doing the universe a favor by making the hard decisions for it. By killing half of the universe, it makes room for more people to have resources and food to go around ultimately leading to the survival of millions of different species. Obviously the Avengers and all the other heros don't agree with this, and tirelessly try to keep the stones away from Thanos. I will not spoil the movie for you but the ending is much more grim than you would expect and leaves you with more questions than answers. That fact may leave some people metaphorically with a bad taste in their mouth, but we must remember that this is the Marvel universe and not everything is as it seems. So in the meantime appreciate the fact the Marvel's Infinity War has the biggest wow factor in the Marvel Universe so far.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","Just a quickie. This film does well to hold up the standard of MCU films up until this points. The Russo Brothers to well to emulate the different feel of each and every character from other films like the Guardians. Most of the characters were pretty useless all in all. Cap did next to nothing, and to think this was meant to be the last film on his contact. There was a ton of action which, at the end, felt like noise. It feels like they pushed to have every single hero here whilst most were unnecessary additions. My main gripe is the deaths: Spoilers for Ant Man 2 btw. I realise that half the population on earth is about 3.5 billion but I think killing off pretty much everyone apart from the original team and Rocket was a bit overkill and convenient. All the Guardians are dead as well and the entire Ant Man team apart from Scott becuase the snap doesn't affect the quantum realm. Even Fury and Hill are gone. It's essentially just a big set up for Avengers 4, which is what annoys me. This film was hyped up for ages and as a fan of comic books and comic book movies in general I was really bloody excited but then it ended up being a huge set up with no real consequences. It's 100% obvious that anyone that turned to dust will be back. Holland is already filming Spiderman Far From Home, all the Guardians are filming Vol. 3, this was pretty much confirmed when Bautista threatened to quit over the Gunn controversy. Jackson and Smulders are filming Far From Home. It was annoying to say the least they these deaths were bigged up when they're all fake. Disney does not like to take risks. Loki dying is a grey area because I don't believe they would kill their most profitable villain and he's died before. Vision I believe is pretty much dead. Gamora is back for Guardians 3 so I'm unsure about her. We're all fairly certain that time travel will be involved in the next Avengers as well and one theory is that Shuri figures out a way to destroy the Infinity gems (yes I say gems because that's what they should be called) because she basically figured it out in IW, they go back in time and destroy all the stones before Thanos can get them which basically means Vision won't be coming back unless some sort of time paradox happens. Either way, the rate of the ones left alive is up in the air ironically. Basically, this film surfs on action and emotion but since the emotion is, for want of a better word, short-lived when you realise nothing sad actually happened, it basically works on action which echoes that of previous films. The emotion was high, despite as short as I felt it, especially Spiderman, but, in my honest opinion, I am going to wait until Avengers 4 to give see if this was a good or bad set up and if this was worth it.

","Alright so I'm going to try my best to keep this as a NON-SPOILER REVIEW, as there are many shocking plot twists and surprises and I wouldn't want to ruin that experience for you. Wow! What a ride! This film was everything I wanted it to be! Exciting, thrilling, and beautifully crafted over the course of 10 years and 19 films. Yes, I have waited for this ever since the inception of the MCU back in 2008, but more importantly as someone who read Jim Starlin's Infinity Gauntlet series 17 years ago. It was breathtaking and jaw dropping to see something of this scope come to life on the big screen from the very same comics I read as a child. @therussobrothers did an amazing job balancing the tone of all the characters (comedic and serious tones) and giving every character their spotlight without making it feel too overcrowded or bloated. The action itself in some of the scenes were taken directly from the pages of Hickman's 'Infinity' run couple of years ago which made me really happy to see. Although there were a lot of surprises in the film, the one element that surprised me the most was the amount of emotional weight that the film carried, it really helped develop certain character arcs especially Thanos, and man oh man when Thanos comes on screen, he really steals it! Not only is he frightening and intimidating, but he has a very grounded and philosophical twist to his character that makes you sympathize for him and his surprisingly emotional motivations. Action was great and easy to follow with no shaky cams this time (yaaaaay!), but the overall story and execution was better than Civil War and Winter Soldier (which everyone knows I love to death). In the end this was everything I hoped and wanted to see in an Infinity War film and I really can't wait for Avengers 4 next year! Whatever you do, see this film before someone spoils it for you as there are many idiots going and spoiling it for others who haven't had the time to see it on opening day! Make sure you experience it in IMAX if you have one next to you, the screen is much bigger and visuals look more vibrant and sharp!

All the trailers and interview by the cast and director indicated the new Avengers movie would be a blockbuster, as well as heartbreaking. I was spoiled that Loki will die very soon in the beginning of the movie and I was very very sad . 
I watched the movie 5 times in all. The first time, I watched the movie with my friend and I was totally shocked by the begining scene. The dark light, horrible voice, blood and fire, broken tesseract, defeated Thor ,all showed Thanos's enormous capability. I'm big fan of Thor and Loki, I just can't believe one of my beloved characters died painfully within 10 minuets and Thor was exploded into the space, unknowing what will happen to him.
Infinity war is grand. We can see almost all the superheroes from the former 18 movies, which is incredible. Thanos is absolutely the toughest vallain ever and his goal is to wipe out half of the universe randomly. I don't judge his purpose is right or wrong, but I don't like him.

The promotional aspect of this movie falls very short in how amazing Avengers Infinity War actually is. The performances were stellar, the action was an achievement, cinematography will blow your mind, and you will be shocked over and over again. You will laugh, your will cry, you will truly enjoy this amazing film. Thanos is given a dynamic the likes of which I have never seen in that character, and I was completely glad to see how they were able to bring him to life on the big screen.

","Prepared for 10 years, infinity war was definitely the best movie of Marvel series ever. 
First of all, let's talk about the characters. Iron man, Tony showed his responsibility to save the world, after the civil war. That meant he didn't stick to the rules but followed his will to save lives. Captain American still fought for his justice, so do other heroes, such as black widow, black panther, and scarlet witch. Thor felt sad, angry, and helpless, but he still stood out and fight for the people. In addition, even though Star lord looked easy about the destruction, he knew that he had nothing to lose; that's why he was angry about Thanos when he heard about Gamora's death. Most important of all, the villian, Thanos, also had lots of stories. We knew that he had a dream, that the balance of the universe could persist. Consequently, he searched infinity gems with all his heart. There were so many other characters that could not be analyzed thoroughly in my review. However, that meant the movie was successful about building characters. 
Second, this movie gave us a strong emotion, despair. At the begin of this movie, it showed us how much powerful Thanos was. Until the end fo the movie, we still couldn't figure out any solution to defeat him. That stressful plot made audience to gave more concentration. Additionally, some funny parts really spiced up this movie and made this movie not so sad. 
Third, the action scenes were designed so great that I couldn't take my eyes off the movie. Take some examples, such as Dr. Stranger's fight, the invasion of Thanos's army, and the fight against Thanos. 
There were a lot advantages that I couldn't mention in this review. However, there were still some defects of this movie. Take an example. Thanos's love to Gamora was not so obvious, that I couldn't feel sad for Thanos.
Overall, this was the best Marvel movie ever.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

Thanos the ""crazy titan"" that had been shown to us from the post-credit scene of The Avengers in 2012, after a Great cameo in Guardians of the galaxy in 2014 and for the last time in the post credit scene of Avengers age of Ultron. The film focuses on showing us why Thanos wants to opt for all the infinity strones since he believes that with them he could bring balance to the universe by annihilating half of it, and thus save it from itself, because of the overpopulation and lack of resources in the universe . The movie is full of epicity, insertity, and is full of surprises, the whole ensemble of characters is perfectly balanced. All the characters retain their personality, and shine one by one, the teams are fantastic. The action is unexpected, from the first minute of the pecula there are completely epic ballas and with good choreography, the tension is felt throughout the film being sanded with classic MCU humor no joke feels forced, they are necessary to release tension. The end of the movie is something so unexpected and surprising, without a doubt it is the best movie of superheroes in history, and it becomes more than that since it has a plot that is totally well realized and a villain who is totally well written that ends up being the protagonist of this epic infinity war that leaves us thinking seriously about the future of our heroes and the MCU.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","""Amazing"",""best MCU film ever"",""so good"". These are just some quotes from people who saw this summer blockbuster before me. Don't get me wrong, it was amazing and a visual spectacle at that, but was it just me or was it just too much?
Firstly, it's a film you need super human bladder control for, as the mammoth 150 minute feature is so quick paced you will be lost even if you miss even 5 seconds of it, tirelessly trying to keep up with the characters whereabouts. As Thanos causes destruction everywhere he steps foot, it brings all of our favourite heroes together. Special mention to Thanos by the way, easily one of my favourite characters. His primal need for the stones is engrossing and you almost want him to succeed in retracting all of them just to see what madness will happen next. Visually it does live up to the hype, I saw the film in 2D and sort of regret that decision as I was completely blown away.
As for the story line I loved it. However, the sheer amount of avengers/guardians of the galaxy stars crammed in, it felt that there was never enough time to get involved with anyone's story before I was thrown into someone else's.
This installment did not mess about with instant anquish for characters and fans from minute one and showed no signs of slowing down.

3448,4 June 2018,losermcgee,9," Good film, not as good as recent Marvel films
","Let's start this review by saying Infinity War is a good movie. The problem is it's just not a great movie. It feels like all the Marvel movies lately have been at that great level, and in the case of Black Panther, in that rare spot above great. Yes, there is a definite dip in quality in this movie, but it feels like a much greater dip due to how amazing the studio has been lately. As for why this movie wasn't as good as the rest, well my main problem is that it ends up feeling a bit overstuffed. There are way too many characters to keep track of, and you end up losing track of them. It ends up feeling like you're waiting for your favorite character to show up, and every second they are off screen, you are not as interested in the film. Also, I feel the end does have a major problem. Not what happens and the decisions that were made but the fact that it is simply unsatisfying. This is the movie we've waited for 2 years to see, the movie with all of these actors, all this hype. Not to mention, we have to wait another year for the next movie, with the way this film ends, one can't help feeling it could have delivered a slightly more complete-feeling film. However, there is still a lot of good stuff in this movie. For one, the as-promised dark-drama theme of this movie is ever-present and makes the movie feel like no other Marvel film. You probably are skeptical this kind of genre would work for a Marvel film, but as soon as you hear the voiceover in the opening credits, you know that despite whatever you feel about your Marvel films, the Russo Brothers have done a damn good job making a dark one. Also a lot of the characters hold a lot of value. The best by a clear mile in my opinion is Thor. He has come from being the goofy, hard-to-take-serious hero to being the hardened, hell-bent god that he is made out to be. Thor, in this movie, is one of the most badass superheroes ever, if not the most. Also, Thanos, despite being the villain is a clear highlight of this film. First we had Killmonger, now Thanos, it seems the MCU villain effect is wearing off. Josh Brolin gives an excellent CGI performance kin to Andy Serkis' Caesar or Gollum, not to mention the character development for him is incredible. An especially high point is his relationship with Gamora, which is beyond what we could have hoped. It is extremely emotionally strong. Those two are the definite highlights in term of characters, but there are plenty other great characters. Doctor Strange has several mystical-action scenes, some better than what we saw in his title film. Teen Groot surprisingly has a strong character arc. The only character I disliked was Star-Lord who not only makes out-of-character decisions but feels like he is either mad or confused the entire movie and fails to show much else. His character arc also feels pointless as it fails to resolve any conflicts with the character. All in all, Infinity War delivers a strong sequel, it just has a few flaws, which is not something I can say for the previous 6 MCU films.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","Juggling a wide array of characters from 18 different movies, across a 10 year span, Avengers: Infintiy War delivers on all cilindars. Marvel has once again taken a seemingly impossible task, and proved they can handle anything thrown their way. Each character gets their chance to shine during the runtime, and although there can be clashing tones, the movie never loses its audience. For a common movie fan who hasn't followed the marvel movies, you may be lost. The movie contains no character development, and it doesn't have to, as we've been developing these characters for 10 years.

This movie is the best marvel movie no doubt . They provide very little amount of classy action scene. They just try to make people emotional fool except 2 or 3 scenes. Black order failed to their comic greatness. Characters did not get enough screen time. And those characters died who already got their sequel.
Humour is the pros and cons too of this movie. As some were fitted properly where some ruins the tone. 
But the movie provides a great adventure after all. Tight scripts and the suspension for the future movies makes the movie better.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

3465,2 May 2018,rocconanut,9," Epic and unforgettable, a genre mastepiece and a milestone
","Russo's brothers warned us that would have been an unforgettable movie, but neither in my best dreams i could expect something like that. The characters are perfectly managed, lots subplots that risked of weight down add something new, and their characterization gives me goosebumps beacuse of his consistency. See the characters we love interact between them is as funny as serious, because of Thanos's imminent threat, wich here is simply monstrous. One of Marvel's biggest problems has always been the villain, often too flat and stereotypical, Thanos instead it's all the opposite and He gives us a memorable villain, with which you empathize and that behind the Motion Capture hides a heart and a soul. From a technical point of view the film reaches roofs never topped, with breathtaking visual effects and a fast and frenetic direction, which in the fightins gives the best of itself. While not having a dark stile, the film proposes mature and tragic's themes, answering a lots of questions but leaving us with many questions marks wich will presumably be unveiled in the next chapter. My only issue is in my opinion the hurry with which the final battle was managed, although this defect is blown away by the end. Russo's brothers have been able to do what 10 years ago(release of the first Marvel movie) seemed impossible and they did it dosing everything perfectly, everyone has his role to play within the story. Nobody is indispensable, but everyone is necessary to face a threath wich concerns them closely and that risks to undermine everything they care about. Humour is not exaggerated, but on the contrary, it contrasts very well with the dark's themes, and Guardians of the Galaxy fit perfectly. Like it or not, Avengers Infinity War is destined to enter in the history of cinema, for social and economic importance, it's the culmination, the apotheosis of 10 years of hard work, and It won't be Pulp Fiction or Citizen Kane but is a genre mastepiece. On conclusion Avengers Infinity War is destined to become iconic, it's epic, unforgettable, exciting and courageous and despite some little defects it's going to be one of the best entertaining movie ever made, if not the best.

3472,15 March 2019,souzachristopher,10," How to Properly Subvert Expectations
","Rian Johnson, Shane Black, Warner Brothers, take notes! In a day and age where films such as Iron Man 3, Justice League and Star Wars: The Last Jedi subvert audience expectations to infuriating results, Avengers: Infinity War does it in a way that actually works. Returning behind the camera for IW are The Russo Brothers who previously helmed the last two Captain America films for Disney/Marvel from a screenplay written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely who also wrote all three films in the Captain America trilogy and who were writers for the first two Chronicles of Narnia films. The plot follows the Mad Titan Thanos (played by Josh Brolin) in his attempt to find all six Infinity Stones and bring balance to the universe. Though the Avengers have split up months after the Accords situation, they must sacrifice all in an attempt to stop Thanos by teaming up with allies, old and new. At first, it might look like too much to Cram all of these 50+ characters (yes, even the Stan Lee cameo) into one movie, but in all fairness, it's all been building up to this since the first Iron Man movie. And I'm pleased to say that it definitely lives up to expectations and like I said before, subvert those expectations in a way that doesn't alienate audiences. Whereas Iron Man 3's idea of subverting expectations is doing a live-action rehash of The Incredibles while at the same wasting the acting talents of Sir Ben Kingsley, Infinity War's version of it is a Marvel sequel influenced by films like Wrath of Khan, Empire Strikes Back, Aliens and even Apocalypse Now while telling a different story at the same time. Whereas The Last Jedi's idea of subverting expectations is a pointless side quest to Casino Royale, Infinity War's version is a side quest to meet a giant Peter Dinklage (YESSS!!) who actually does something that moves the plot. And whereas Justice League's idea of subverting expectations is 2 hours of Superman's CG Homer Simpson mouth and PS3 quality graphics topped off with a forgettable score from the always talented Danny Elfman, Infinity War's version is two and a half hours of amazing visual effects and impressive CGI work on Thanos and to top it all off,a beautiful orchestral score by Academy Award nominated composer Alan Silvestri who composed the scores to Captain America: The First Avenger and The Avengers (2012) and whose known for his collaborators with Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future trilogy, Roger Rabbit, Forrest Gump & Contact) and Stephen Sommers (Mummy Returns & Van Helsing) and who also worked on films such as Predator 1 & 2, The Abyss & Ready Player One. But obviously the highlight of the film is obviously Josh Brolin as Thanos in what might be his best preformence in all of his career (tied with No Country For Old Men). The moment he is on screen from the cold open to the very end before the credits roll, I was impressed with Brolin's preformence, even considering the fact that Thanos is a character that could only be created through VFX,I felt like I was watching a preformence instead of another generic CGI baddie and I really sympathized with his motivations.And he's definitely the best villain the MCU has introduced thus far. All in all, it might be the most divisive film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the most divisive film of 2018, but it did live up to my own expectations and therefore it instantly became my favorite film of the MCU and my favorite film of 2018 overnight. I was completely silent by the film's final moments when I saw it in theaters on my first viewing and I'm still impressed with the film after multiple viewings.

","After the first time I watched Infinity Wars, I left feeling much like everyone else, mind blown at what I just seen. ""What just happened"", I told myself. The good guys lose, evil won. With such a huge cast of lead characters, it's expected that screen time would be limited, but the Russo brothers managed to create a story that utilizes the full potential of each character move the story in a way that don't clutter the screen. Thor is on a mission to forge a new weapon that could slay the Mad Titan, Iron Man, Strange and Spidey team up with the Guardians to fight Thanos on Titan, while Cap and crew try to protect Wakanda and The Vison against Thanos' army. So long story short, Thanos recovers all infinity stones and with the snap of a finger, half of all life in the universe cease to exist. And yes I know this isn't the end of the story, but for such a massive filming event to end on such a somber note, was something else. The second time I watched the film, I seen it in a different light. Although Thanos is a villain to everyone watching, he is very much the centre of the movie. He is in fact the protagonist of the film. I mean, watch the movie from his point of view. Yes he is a genocidal maniac, but to him, his mission is just. This is not a film about The Avengers fighting Thanos and losing, this is a story about Thanos and what he thinks is protecting the future of the universe, and succeeding. The Avengers are just road blocks set up to keep Thanos from carrying out his plan. I've seen many videos of people saying that Thanos is the hero of the Infinity Wars. And although I disagree with Thanos being a hero, to Thanos, he is the hero. But, isn't anyone who wins a war considered a hero to the people fighting that cause. Finally, I want to talk about the character of Thanos in general. Not ever has the MCU experienced such a layered complexed character. Many villains in the MCU can be classified as one dimensional who's only goal is world domination and revenge. Than Thanos emerges from the shadows and gives the MCU exactly what it needs, a complex character who shows emotion. One thing I can say about Thanos is that, he don't seem to do all this for glory or to ""rule the universe"", he simply believes that what he is doing to benefiting the future of all life. Josh Brolins performance gives Thanos so many layers, and should be mentioned in the same conversations as Andy Serkis.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","There is a dilemma of not being able to say much after you watch this movie when you follow the directors' request of keeping the hype free of spoilers. Also, I would hate to spoil it for fans as much as I might have killed who do it to me. It also happens that I cannot contain my reaction so here what you should know. So this is a review about nothing.
First, let me tell you the other possible tag lines that describe this movie the best:
1. The Greatest Superheroes' movie of All time.
2. NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU THINK YOU'RE PREPARED, WELL, YOU ARE NOT AND YOU CAN NEVER BE.
Second, let's talk about the movie itself. Avengers might be in the title but you will certainly feel it's like the ones before. It is like four whole movies merged into a big one. First you will visit the worlds you know, and then those worlds will come together and get divided into whole new worlds, which will again get together in the most unexpected way. You will find yourself switch from one world to another the way you switch channels, feeling confused before you remember this is infinity War and that it's supposed to happen. It's not the way this movie summed up a whole universe of 18 movies before it that it's considered genius, it's how you find yourself get transitioned from one world to another, how to get from one point to a very far way one so simply and naturally only to leave you not feeling anything but stunned. 
Third, what to expect?
Well, there is actually no point cause no matter how you watched and rewatched every single work marvel had produced, you will still be left thunderstruck. You will laugh, cry, sometimes both at the same time. You will be hit by surprise that you find nothing to do except to stare at the screen with wide eyes and a jaw dropped to the floor. You will be scared, shocked and lot of the times will catch yourself sitting on the edge of your seat, literally, raising your hand to your mouth in the most unexpected moments. The most important thing though that all of this will be in a good way. 
Request: Please go watch it. Whether you are a Marvel fan or not , whether you are a superheroes' movies fan or not. You might regret that you didn't experience it in the time when it's still fresh and no one had spoiled it for you, but what's even more important, is that you will find whatever you wish for in it.

","If you're a fan of the previous movies, this film will definitely make you laugh one moment and cry the next. The movie starts an incredibly fast past, largely because the tension has already been built up in the after credits of the previous films (Thano's 2-3 cameos). The star of this film is definitely Josh Brolin, as he displays unique emotional depth as the nihilistic villian Thanos. I don't think I've seen another movie that packs quite so much into the time frame given I wouldn't have cut or added anything. After the film was over, everyone in the theater said something similar to ""I need to go sit down and think about what just happened."" This is likely due to the emotional shifts, the constant struggle of the characters, and the sense of unending dread the movie makes you feel. I gave this movie 10 stars, because there really isn't any valid criticism to give.

","I can't imagine that so many people would hate this one. Avengers: Infinity War is dark, emotional, and entertaining. THIS IS NOT A COMEDY!!!! Sure, there were some jokes, but that doesn't make it a comedy! The first iron man had jokes, but it wasn't a comedy either. It is obviously the biggest and the best marvel cinematic universe movie. Why can't anyone else see it that way? And about Thanos, I myself am a reader of his stories in the comics, Disney had nothing to do with him, marvel had to make him a more complex villain. There's no way Disney would allow thanos to be a one dimensional CGI villain like steppenwolf from the DC universe, they wanted to humanize Thanos to be a more sympathetic and honorable character, he makes hard choices like we do, he makes sacrifices like we do. I have Infinity War twice in different cinemas, the more you rewatch it the more you appreciate Thanos, I know that I should've written a review last month a few days after watching it but like people say better late than never. Before you call this review 'unhelpful' I just want you to know, the Russo brothers did an excellent job in making such a great film like this, don't trust those reviews that say this film is for kids, it's not, it's for teenagers, young adults, and adults.

","This movie held no punches. It immediately started taking away characters fans have admired for a very long time. But this is what the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been building up to for 10 years. They have blessed fans with unique characters played by remarkable actors, and this story would tell the world that good things don't last forever. At least that's what I expected. The movie took me but surprise when they took away characters we have just started to love. The movie slowly built up to the final battles between good and evil. That is when I expected them to put an end to the original line-up, but they didn't. They knew exactly what the audience was going to expect, so they gave us the opposite. This movie made me sad, angry, and happy. I laughed, and cried. The movie was full of reunions, and introductions between characters. And Thanos is by far one of the most complex villains I've ever seen in a Marvel movie. Even if the ending was the opposite of my expectations, the movie reminded me why I spend my money on these movies. Why I anxiously wait for the next movie to come out. They know how to make their fans feel every single emotion, and in the end, that is truly what good movies do.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

 You literally have to be a Marvel fan to understand the story line and had to have watched all the movies to get to this point. As a movie goer you have to invest the time to fully critique it. 
 The characters I have come to enjoy and I feel the majority of all top billed actors embody the superhero or villain persona and play it well. 
 You can also read the comics to get an idea of where the director will possibly go next in part 2. 
 From comic book to the big screen Disney has achieved what most studios wish they can do in the super hero arena and be extremely successful at it. Kuddos to them and I'm delighted Marvel is in such good hands. 
 Lastly, I read some reviews on here which I carefully dissected and I've come to the conclusion they did not read comics or just not Marvel fans. I recommend reading before critiquing.

3642,27 April 2018,parker-36293,9," It's the Mad Titan's universe, and we are all just paying rent.
","A towering achievement in modern day blockbuster storytelling, Infinity War hits hard right out of the gate, and continues to pummel you with spectacle beyond compare throughout its nearly three hour run time. 
While it's thrilling to see so many amazing characters meeting, and sharing the screen, make no mistake, this is very much a film about Thanos. Brolin's performance as the Mad Titan shines throughout the film. He is both bombastic and nuanced. Terrifying, and fallible. Thanos is now by far the MCU's most fantastic and interesting villain. 
Weaving together so many characters and storylines could easily have gone horribly wrong, but the Russo brothers navigate it seamlessly as they take us through the story, and from planet to planet at an almost break neck speed. It's no surprise that it's thrilling and hilarious to see Tony Stark interact with Doctor Strange, or Thor banter with Star Lord. Every character gets their moment and their chance to shine a bit(Spiderman and Doctor Strange were both standouts for me personally)even if that's all they get. Because the film never really slows down, you shouldn't expect a lot of character growth, or deep narrative arcs for any of our heroes. We've had eighteen films for that, and this is about seeing them all play and interact in this world together. This is an event film after all, and can really only be judged in the context of the MCU's entirety. There's no denying that Infinity War's greatest weakness is its assumption that you are very invested in these characters and storylines. So when I sit back to judge its quality as a film, I do so as a fan of the franchise and as someone who has seen all the films many times. Basically what I'm saying is there is no way for this film to really stand alone. If you haven't seen or didn't like most of the other MCU films, you will be very confused right from the start. 
In the end, this film absolutely belongs to Thanos, and we are all the better for it.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

The main character was Thanos and we actually had a villain with character instead of a big bad brute who just wanted to kill for the hell of it, there was purpose behind it, at least in his mind. There were many moments where I was laughing, then 2 minutes later I was sad. So many highs and lows throughout the movie. The acting was great all around besides Bruce Banner. The ending was so great because no body expected it and it just leaves us wanting more from these movies. I cannot WAIT to see what they're going to do next year.

","What the hell? When we grow up, we been taught that: Good always wins over evil, Kindness always wins... Good will always prevail... Be good to others.. Always be kind... Pray for those who need it... and blah, blah blah.
This movie is really f* up (pardon my French), Thanos is a homicidal/genocidal maniac and yet the movie tried to depict him as some kind of hero or god on a mission. Hulk is just like a sad clown trying to be funny but so pathetic, I guess because the idiot director from Thor Ragnarok made him that way therefore the 2 idiots directed this movie carry on the same path.
Like one of the reviewers commented, we go see superheroes to feel good, seeking escapism. We wish to have someone like Ironman, Spiderman, Captain America to right the wrongs, to seek justice for all, to protect the weaks and so on which doesn't exist in real life. And my 11 year old son adore them all (all the Marvel heroes), and I made a BIG mistake by taking him to see this sorry-ass movie, and it brokes his heart. It not nice at all to see all your idols get their ass kicked left and right throughout the movie then get killed at the end. Then... hang around waiting for the credit to end to watch some last segment of the movie indicate and left the movie theatre with some vague hope that ""part 2"" (which won't be out until next year) that something will happen to justify all this heart-breaking nonsense.

","After starting with the first Iron Man 10 years ago and teasing for the first time the big underlying villain that would be Thanos 6 years ago in the first Avengers movie, we have finally arrived to what it all was building up for, and it was well worth the wait.
The Movie has an incredible story told in a incredibly paced format, all the characters seem important and are able to shine in their due time, not only that but the comedy was just right and the team ups and fight scenes in the movie are the best I have ever seen. Thanos is without a doubt the best villain we've seen in this universe so far, not only for the long foreshadow but also because of his motivations that are perfectly explained and in a way which every viewer can, in a way, understand why he believes he has to do his mission. Beyond that, the relationships between characters are explored and developed in a brilliant way, which makes the movie feel more alive combined with the perfect editing that makes the two and a half our movie fly by. I must also mention that not only the CGI was amazingly done and detailed but the whole movie had stunning visuals that showed us the amazing universe that was created for this experience.
At last, the story ended with an unexpected and wholesome bang, that made me not only tear but also feel complete. I loved every bit of this movie and I certainly recommend it to everyone, but i do recommend you to watch the prior movies in order to feel the correct attachment to the characters and to understand how well thought out the MCU was.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","Let me start off by saying I thought the movie was good over all. The plot was more complex than that of most Marvel films, the intersections of the Avengers storyline with Black Panther, Doctor Strange, and Guardians of the Galaxy being well-done.
The movie had the obligatory Marvel comic relief, but also left plenty of room for tragic moments. The ending was not at all what I expected and is a nice departure from everything-is-undone-in-the-last-20-minutes that many superhero movies feature. The dialogue was witty and for the most part well-written, and the special effects were unbelievably good.
My only complaint with this movie is with the pacing. I realize it is supposed to be the big battle Thor Ragnarok (as well as Age of Ultron and Blcak Panther had been leading up to) but the back-to-back action sequences sometimes left me thinking the movie had too little plot spread across too great a time span.

","Avengers: Infinity War, directed by Anthony and Joe Russo( who gave us the terrific Civil War and The Winter Soldier), is what we can term as a satisfying summer spectacle. This is not a film. It's an event. In a film with more than 20 superheroes, not once does one feel that any one of them are underutilized. 
The plot, as you all know , is about the conquest by Thanos (who is a computer generated character and given a terrific performance by Josh Brolin), to conquer all the 6 infinity stones and to wipe out half the universe. It's all up to the Avengers along with the Guardians of the Galaxy to stop his evil plans. 
That's all I can tell u about the plot. Because revealing too much will kill the experience. The director(s) have packed in all they can - marvelous action set pieces, humour, twists and dramatic moments etc....
Almost all the department have done their jobs neatly. Be it the stunning VFX or the exhilarating background score , the film has it all.
The climax, I would like to mention, is not at all what you would expect, especially since this is a Marvel movie. Also the character deaths too will come across as a shock. 
Now coming to the performances, the list is going to be too long if I mention each and every actor. Everyone has done their roles perfectly and not once do you feel that a single character is given prominence. Hats off for the director(s) for undertaking a project of this magnificence. 
So all in all this an experience or should I say THIS IS the Marvel movie we all waited for. So go in and have a Blast.

Could you have imagined the mouths drop if they would have revealed Han's pilot instructor as the Dark Monolith himself, 'Vader'. Any chance for a Vader scene anywhere should be jumped on.

 What do you think this is, Justice League and it's lame ""DCEU""? Just one movie to end something that they put ten years of effort to make? 
Marvel invented the cinematic universe, nobody thought it was a good idea and they surprised the WORLD with what they have become. 
I'm not gonna lie, the movie had its flaws, but look how many others have tried.
DC and Warner tried to make the same, but in five movies they are already crumbling apart.
Universal studios and it's ""monsterverse"" failed at the FIRST movie.
Star Wars has tried but it is going down while trying to make a tenth movie.
But Marvel knows how to make it right. They managed to make 18 movies connected in this great event. Of course there were some flaws, but the did it, and they did it awesomely.

Everybody but the fans thought this was the end, but this is just the beginning of the end of a twenty chapters story. Why did you thought there were so many kills? To make people return to see what happens next? NO! They did it because they knew that there were too many characters, and people were going to be mad at them for the short screen time. The end of this story will be in Avengers 4, but the saga will continue with 20 MORE CHAPTERS with a new story to tell.

You see emotions, the tiniest movements, and incredibly realistic wounds in the faces of some CGI characters. They are just so real. Don't let other reviews fool you when they say the plot of this movie sucks. I felt it was incredibly well-driven, even though this feels like 2-3 movies put together. But who wouldn't want to see multiple movies flowing together into one? Isn't that why we all love the MCU so much? The characters were amazing (as always). The Black Order was incredible, as each of them could have been standalone villains in their own movies. Thanos was just the best villain I have seen in any movie in a long time. I empathized with him, hated him, and had that moment where I was like, ""You know? He's kind of right. But he's still a jerk."" Just, all I have to say is Marvel truly outdid themselves. The ending is just...wow. They could not have carried that out any better than they did. Perfection. I found nothing wrong with this move.

It's almost too much and yet not enough in other ways, because the screen time for many characters get spread so thin. Assuming you have seen most of the MCU movies up to this point, you'll appreciate that a handful of the characters previously under-developed have gotten more attention, but many of the favorites who were previously better-developed got barely enough time to be a cue for a crowd cheer.

The best parts of the film are the character interactions, it's genuinely hilarious, although overall the film is pretty dark in tone. It's no real spoiler to say that major characters do die. The standouts for me were Thor and the Guardians, so much great banter. The same can be said for Stark, Strange and Spider-Man. Most characters get enough screen time and the action is relentless, jumping from one action set piece (or World) to another without feeling too much. You will experience just about every emotion watching this film. The scenes in Wakanda was also a stand out, especially the battle!

","I have been a fan of the Marvel movies since the beginning, but I was a fan of Marvel long before that. Through the comic books and the cartoon series, I have grown to love this world and the characters that inhabit it, and the MCU movies truly brought them to life, they allowed them to be in the real world. This instalment of their adventures was showing all their hens coming to roost - there were jokes of course, but it was deadly serious from the very beginning. Every character knew the stakes were high and by the end of it, the silence by which the characters expired thickened this seriousness. I was brought to the verge of tears, holding them back only because I was in public, because for all intents and purposes my friends are dead. 
This is a brilliant film and merges all the light-heartedness that the MCU is known for with the true grit and realism of the Netflix shows, despite the aliens and flashy lights.
Thanos is given a much more grounded reason for his tirade and this makes him one of the more menacing and powerful villains ever seen.

","Avenger: Infinity War is a great film and I think that the directors have mastered the ability to create films that draw in the audience and places you in the characters shoes for 180 minutes. The film is funny but serious and engages the audience, Thanos is by far the greatest MCU villain and in my opinion the greatest comic book movie villain (period). Can we talk about RED SKULL, he was the last person I would expect to see in this movie and also the last person I would expect to be guarding the soul stone. Thor and his new hammer (or axe), storm breaker has to be the highlight of the film...but he should have gone for the head. Loki's death seemed almost meaningless, almost like it was just an excuse to show that there not to scared to kill off characters...within the first five minutes. Gamoras death has a lot more meaning as it leaves Thanos emotionally damaged through the course of the film. Overall the ending was disappointing and left much to be desired, but I guess we will have to wait a year for the currently unnamed Avengers 4.

A triumphant blockbuster from the MCU sure to break(ing) and set(ting) new trends & records. It is packed with an intense and intricate narrative that wastes no time building its momentum and connects all the 18 movie threads coherently while solving minor plotholes of each film, suffered individually so far.
Particularly applaudable and respected is the writing to embed such a huge lot of characters by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely and the gripping direction by the Russo brothers in creating this massive behemoth. The blissfully orchestrated music by Alan Silvestri is what keeps you hooked unconsciously.
Marvel has finally learnt to justify their villains through Thanos and his villainous motives. The CGI and VFX unlike previous marvel movies have all been taken to a whole new level. Such high order ingenuity and planning in film-making is rarely observed in hollywood movies these days. 
Turn your heads down and you will regret missing an alluring moment. The makers left no stone unturned. 
Sadly the fate of few characters and the waiting required to watch the untitled Avengers film next year is unfortunate because of the shocking surprises. Hope Ant-Man and the Wasp & Captain Marvel give us a peek into what's coming next. 10 Years of creative efforts ultimately paid off from MCU & Kevin Fiege. James Cameron feels there is an avengers fatigue incoming, and it has been appropriately answered through this one that MCU will never take you there.

","I've been going to marvel movies since the first Spider-Man movie hit back in the early 2000s. I've seen so much change and disappointment throughout the years. Over the past 10 years however I have been a die hard fan of the majority of the marvel movies that have come out. 
With that being said this is absolutely 100% my favorite. You've probably read articles and reviews that have described how the audience was unable to control their reactions to certain scenes in this movie. From my experience that holds true. 
You've probably also read that the movie is so overwhelming that many people are going to have to see it more than once. That also is true. 
What completely blew my mind about this movie is the way it was able to throw the fanbase off in speculation only to show them that they were wrong almost completely 
Every character (aside from 1-2) that dies was predicted to live. While all the characters that people were sure were doomed Were the last ones standing. 
This along with one mindblowingly shocking of a former villain that wasn't advertised at all were the best parts of the movie. 
I liked this movie too much to give it anything less than a 10 but 2 things I didn't like were the cliffhanger and the post credit scene. At least we know that there's sequels for a lot of the characters that died and on top of that at least there's only a year gap between this one and the second part.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","First of the expectations for this movie were one of the highest ever, some would say a bit unrealistic and a tad overhyped with all the trailers and promotions, Now after watching it I can honestly say that all my expectations were met, I probably got even more than I asked for, The characters were perfectly implemented with none of them feeling left out, everyone had their moment or two as they were in my opinion perfectly juggled trough out the whole movie, The acting was on point, the action was everywhere from minute one with only slight pauses that would let you catch your breath along with the perfect amount of humor before all hell breaks loose again. Now I don't think the movie was absolutely perfect, there are a few mistakes that I would like to point out, first one would be Ebony Maw freezing in space instantly after getting ejected into it, as we know it would take hours for a person to freeze in space because the only way to lose heat up there is to radiate it away witch takes hours, the second thing i didn't like was about Thanos, even though he was really consistent trough the whole movie it would often be pointed out that if you give him what he wants he will spare at least half the lives he comes across, with the exception of the dwarves, he only left one dwarf alive while telling him rather mean things to make him feel even worse, I think that was a mistake and it made him feel slightly inconsistent. But to be honest those things are hard to notice during the movie and it still earns a 10/10 for the experience and the amount of fun I had watching this movie.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","Going in to this film I was already a massive fan of the movies that had come before it. I had been introduced to characters I knew such as Captain America and Iron Man, characters I've never heard of like The Guardians of the Galaxy and reimagined characters in this cinematic universe such as Spider-Man. Though a couple of these films may have had flaws (Iron Man 2 for example) they have all been building up to this movie and my God have they pulled it off and more. This film is fantastic and easily one of the best if not best superhero movies released. I have been asked how it compares to Christopher Nolans 'The Dark Knight' and they are two different beasts. One is a superb crime drama with super hero elements and the other every comic book fans dream of a superhero mashup! From the first minute to the last your eyes are hooked, there is not one dull moment as it each fantastic action scene is filled between with tense moments. Each actor plays their roles to a level where you can't see anyone else being these characters. When Spider-Man appeared on screen I became I 10 year old kid again watching the cartoons, you are just swallowed by the film and when they film ended silence fell in my cinema except for a few gasps from the crowd, me personally I had no words for what I had just seen. I laughed at the funny moments, on edge of my seat at the dramatic ones and teared up when the film decided to go on an all out attack on my feels (one moment in particular killed me). All I know is when the film ends I said to a friend that the next film will make more than this one based on the fact you NEED to see the next film. One thing I did say is DC have the Joker Marvel have Thanos. I was absolutely blown away by the villain in this film and put him up there as one of the great movie villain in recent cinematic history, this film is more his movie than the avengers and I was impressed with how complex they made his character.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","Alright so obviously this culmination event film is full of awesome action, hillarious comedy, and some heavy feels :'( and it would be crazy to say it isn't a good movie or even potentially a great movie. That being said there are problems one of which id like to focus on. The power scaling is so crazy throughout the whole movie, when Thanos fights hulk 1v1 with only the power stone(it does give it's bearer increased strength and durability) and bests him easily I was shocked. Later in the movie Drax and Spider-Man holding Thanos is enough to subdue him albeit with some help from the others too but physically paralleled strength seems weird compared to Hulk and Thor. Another example of this is the scene when Iron Man is fighting him primarily on his own on Titan and he cuts his face while also being able to go toe to toe while he had the power, space, reality and soul stone. I suppose we don't know the biology of the alien members of the guardians and clearly Star-Lord retains his half celestial lineage aka his physical durability is better than a regular human but it seems crazy that they even held him off for that long. That being said it obviously sets the stage for what happens when you have Hulk(hopefully not as weak/not ready to fight), Thor(with a new weapon), Iron Man, and Captain Marvel working together as the probable strongest avengers still alive at that time(and potentially in general aside from Doctor Strange and if Star Lord ever taps back into celestial powers) working together to fight him instead of being separated. Honestly at this point the rest of the team is really there as support. Other than Captain America and Vision(who depending on what happens with him could have different powers and/or weakened ones) who could put up a little bit of a fight everyone else(Black Widow, Hawkeye, War Machine, and Okoye don't compare to a full Infinity Gauntlet Thanos. The brains of the Mcu still alive(Shuri, Iron Man, Rocket, and Bruce) will have to help in other ways too.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","I decided to watch this film because I saw it had a 9.2 on IMDB. In my head a film with that score must be good. The hype around this film leaves me utterly disappointed. There is little moral behind the story, cheesy lines, a poor script, stupid unrealistic action. I watched it thinking it had a chance to be as good as Batman the Dark Knight because it holds a similar rating. It is crap! It should be rated 6.4 not 9 or 8. There are to many egos following a plot that sends you across galaxies that are hard to follow. The difference to this film and a great film is that it has no purpose behind it. The batman trilogy was amazing because it can show how to beat the struggles of life. But this, I don't even know what this is. But if its the best hollywood have to offer. Then films are on a decline. We need more meaningful, realistic superhero films. Not action packed. The dark knight trilogy got it spot on.

An amazing performance from Josh Brolin as Thanos left me terrified for every single character that he shared the screen with. Robert Downey Jr. was excellent as always, this time teaming with Tom Holland's Spider-Man, Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange, and most of the Guardians. Chris Hemsworth makes you fall in love with Thor even more as he works alongside Rocket Raccoon and Teenage Groot. I wish Chris Evans had a bigger role in this film as Steve Rodgers, but in a movie this crowded, its a wonder this film ever even worked. I loved the fact that Marvel Studios made Thanos the main character of this film. He was easily the best villain we've ever seen in a Marvel film (sorry Killmonger). After he snaps his fingers, we watch helplessly as our heroes start to disappear. Tom Holland delivers a gut-wrenching performance in his ""death"" scene, and though I know he'll return, it broke my heart to watch my favorite superhero from the time I was little go out that way.

Starlord losing it, appears to give Thanos the opportunity to regroup and hold onto the gauntlet.

","I recommend ""Avengers Infinity War"" because unlike other movies it shows that you should fight for what you believe in and to keep the things you love close. Another reason to watch this is because even though this has more of a serious and detrimental like tone/topic, it encompasses humor into the movie.
The movie ""Avengers Infinity War"" is a movie created by Marvel. Marvel continues the story of the first movie, Avengers. In this movie it shows how the hero's fight for their beliefs at all cost as well as fighting for others and their safety. This film has a relatively young and energetic cast that displays the connection and expressions of the hero's very well. The story of this movie is the hero's trying to stop the notorious Thanos and his dreams of destroying half the Earth for a result of world peace.
I've seen all the Marvel movies and many more and i recommend you to watch this movie because of how it shows the will power they show of fighting for hope and the safety of others no matter what comes their way. I like how it shows this theme in not only some parts of the movie but throughout the whole movie. This cast does a good job of showing and emphasizing what their character believes in and has close to their hearts. They show this in the movie by fighting this superior being (THANOS) for the safety of the people on Earth even though all odds are against them.
Another reason why i recommend this movie is because it has a way its own way to include humor and joy even though this movie has a serious tone to it due to what is at stake and the results that could happen if they failed to do their job. Thanos is a superior being who is known for destroying planets in order to get what he wants and desires, the Avengers are known as Earth's trusty protectors. They were just meant to meet and have a battle. In this serious circumstance they have moments that inflict comedy and ways to show that in dark times we have ways to give others hope and comfort.
Overall i think this movie was great to watch and a movie that i think you would enjoy if you are a marvel fan and like action packed movies. I recommend this movie if you have seen all the marvel movies so that you are able to see the smaller details and so that you have a better understanding of the movie. I can't wait for the second part of the movie, ""Avengers End Game"".",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018
3902,14 March 2019,burdissl,9," Review of Avengers: Infinity War
","To be honest, I've been watching these Avengers movies since I was 8 years old. It was actually the first PG-13 movie my parents let me see, afters piles of weeks of heavy convincing. I remember going to the theater with my older sister, and my friend Dylan. Over the course of these last few years, as i've grown up, my friend and I have always gone back to the movies to see the new Avengers movies that had just hit the silver screen.
With him almost a year ago, I saw Avengers: Infinity war. I was blown away by this movie, from the incredible acting by a star studded cast, to the plot twist at the end that will leave any person in the theater speechless. When the lights turned back on, everyone around me was either crying or their jaws were laying on the floor from being so shocked by the ending. From the astonishing editing, to the great camera work, this movie swept me off my feet.
I usually admit whether I'm biased towards a certain something or in this case a certain franchise, but there is no need to admit being biased in this case, this was hands down of the greatest movies i've ever seen.
The plot of this movie is that Thanos( the most powerful Titan in the universe), is trying to get rid of half of Earth's population. The only way he can accomplish this is by retrieving all 6 infinity stones (these 6 stones are the only reason the universe is a thing, at least in this made up world). Thanos believes that our world's population is becoming too large, and killing off half our population will solve so many problems. After bombarding asgard( basically like heaven in this world) and killing almost all their people, Thanos retrieves the second out of six infinity stones. This is when he orders his army( the black order) to go to earth and retrieve 2 more stones, while he goes out into the depths of the galaxy and gets the two someone only of his power and stature could get. Meanwhile on earth, the almighty universe protectors, The Avengers, are going through a rough patch. They recently broke up( or as the hulk says, Like a band, broke up?""). They got into a huge argument about if they wanted the Avengers to be government run or if they wanted to continue running themselves. Playboy Billionaire tony stark(or iron man) is basically retired, but is then forced to come out of retirement due to being contacted by Hugo Strange(Dr. Strange) an is told that by both him and Bruce banner(Hulk) that Thanos is coming and won't stop until he gets all six infinity stones and ends half of the living population on earth as a whole. After fighting off the Black Order from earth, Stark and 16 year old Peter Parker(Spider Man) follow a spaceship up into space to take back a kidnapped Dr. Strange and the almighty time stone he carries and protects with his life. After saving strange and killing the wizard from the Order( Ebony Maw), they crash land on Thanos's homeland, Titan. They then develop a plan to lure Thanos in and kill him. Meanwhile back on earth, the hero's from the other parts of the world keep trying to fight off the Black Order, but the Order fights back and the battle for the infinity stones commences. Who wins? You'll have to watch to find out!
The acting in this movie blew me away. The star studded cast (Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Josh Brolin, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Pratt, Benedict Cumberbatch, etc.) made the movie the blockbuster breaking film it was. I could really feel the sadness of when Tony Stark(Robert Downey Jr.) had to leave his wife from earth to go and try to save the world, instead of staying behind and starting a family like he promised in the very beginning of the movie( and i'm sure before then as well).They always say great actors make movies what they are. I have to say without this all star lineup of a cast, this movie wouldn't of been close to being as good as it is. Also, I believe less people would have paid to see this movie if the movie had actors (and actresses) of a lesser caliber.
I have to admit, i'm surprised this movie didn't take 10 years to make. I say that because I was shocked about how realistic the aliens and the other made up characters looked in this movie. I have to tip my hat to the film editors, their job was outstanding and i'm surprised they didn't recently win an oscar for best film editing at the Oscars. The perfect example is the final fight scene on Titan with some of the Avengers vs Thanos. All that camera work goes unnoticed(you'll have to see it to know what i'm talking about). The camera work in this movie was also great. In the intense action scenes, both behind the camera or behind the computer, this was one of the main reasons that i'm praising this movie.
If I had to compare this movie to another movie like this( not counting the other like 30 Avenger movies made), I would compare it to it's crosstown rival, Justice League. I compare Infinity war to this movie because of the similar plots and the similar use of superpowers in both stories. I also compare it to The Dark Knight Rises, because it also relates to the topic of being a superhero and protecting what you believe in. That is what I saw almost automatically when I saw this movie, and that is why I wanted to compare these movies together.
After this movie, I think totally differently about movies as a whole. This movie change my way of thinking due to the fact that the ending was so shocking. ALso, in this movie, the directors and writers make you believe one thing will happen, that this movie will end like every other superhero movie ever made. But then suddenly, it totally switches, and the plot that you have been led to believe doesn't happen. Trust me, by the time the credits are rolling and the lights come back on, your eyes will be wide, and you will be shocked. This movie was spectacular in every way possible, and I can't wait for part two!",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

I have never cried so much in a theater.

The movie starts of with the opening Marvel credits, but with a twist. Mysterious and eerie music plays while the Asgardian Vessel begs for mercy. Right of the bat we see how intimidating Thanos really is. The beats Hulk with ease, kills Heimdahl(butchered the name?) and crushes Loki. This is all while Thor is watching.

","I love Marvel movies but I hated this Marvel movie... I'm not just disappointed, I'm really upset. They've spent years building up this universe and they've managed to ruin it all in one movie. I could make a massive list of the things that upset me but for my own sanity I'll just sum it up. Everyone was out of character - so much so that my mother who doesn't follow the movies could tell. Characters aren't as powerful as they're shown to be in other movies which makes fight sequences very frustrating. It feels as if the story was being made up as it went along and character development is thrown out the window. Walking into this movie I knew characters were going to die, I didn't anticipate though that they're deaths would be absolutely meaningless. I feel cheated, it just wasn't good story telling and no amount of shock value can make up for that. It had its moments (which is why I've rated 5 stars) but as a whole it was so terrible it's actually put me off the exisiting Marvel movies. I just don't know how they're going to fix this... I'll never be able to re-watch the other Marvel movies and enjoy them knowing just how horribly they end the journey. I'll let you judge for yourself but I can't see how fans of the MCU could enjoy this. I was in tears out of frustration.

3916,3 June 2019,y-96735,9," Infinity War and Endgame: Perfectly Balanced, as All Things Should Be
","Now that Avengers: Endgame has been released, it seems high time to re-evaluate its predecessor, Infinity War. Endgame was certainly able to do more with setup than simply resolving it, in fact introducing new arcs and conflicts to keep the movie interesting in its own right. Regardless, Infinity War deserves much praise for being able to set up the dramatic scenario of Endgame, while being entertaining on its own.
Infinity War centers around anti-hero Thanos (Josh Brolin) on his quest to collect all six Infinity Stones, in order to wipe out half of all living beings. His reasoning? ""This universe's resources are finite. If left unchecked, life will cease to exist.""
The film's opening scenes depict Loki failing to trick Thanos in an attempt to save his brother, Thor, and protect the Tesseract, which holds the Space Stone. Despite a surprise attack from Hulk, which seems to turn the tides, Thanos eventually overpowers him and acquires his second Infinity Stone. In this very first sequence, Infinity War introduces its key theme of inevitability. Time and again, the Avengers appear to gain the advantage, only for Thanos to beat them back and continue his destructive plot.
In one of the film's most iconic scenes, Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) uses the Time Stone to look into ""14,000,605"" possible futures. When Tony Stark asks, ""In how many do we win?"" he pauses, then replies ""One."" With the extra context of Endgame, we know that this singular future is the one in which Thanos ""wins,"" and then the Avengers triumph in Endgame (more on that later). At the time of first viewing, however, Doctor Strange's lines imply, (in one of the most intensely mocked moments of Infinity War) when Strange simply gives the Time Stone to Thanos, that the universe has already lost. This perfectly sets up Endgame, where the Avengers crawl back from a world which has already lost.
But! in Endgame, the ultimate theme of inevitability is turned on its head, and the viewer realizes that Doctor Strange's odd decisions were actually necessary to defeat Thanos. Rewatching Infinity War now not only dramatically recontextualizes the ""14,000,605"" scene in a sad new way, but also totally rewrites Strange's apparent 'turn to the dark side' as a clever ploy, establishing that, with Strange's help, the salvation of the universe in Endgame is what was truly inevitable.
This fantastic scriptwriting, by the Russo brothers, is what truly brings these two films into masterpieces. Needless to say, the graphical effects are also likely the best and most believable ever seen, from miniscule dust particles adding immersion to perfectly rendered faces, like Hulk and Thanos. Aside from that, the most common complaints about both films are from poor character development. The role of Drax (Dave Bautista) was mostly unfunny crude comments in Infinity War, and he (thankfully) isn't present much in Endgame. Even more egregious is the role of Captain Marvel (Brie Larson), who is not at all present in Infinity War, and barely contributes in Endgame despite being portrayed as incredibly powerful. Granted, Infinity War and Endgame were filmed before Captain Marvel (Brie Larson's introduction). Thus, the character was not yet established and didn't even have an actor in time for Infinity War. Still, this obscenely powerful character being absent from Infinity War, when she is needed most, is not at all excused by ""there are a lot of other planets in the universe"" (her brief explanation from Endgame).
In any case, it seems apparent that Anthony and Joe Russo are much less interested in individual characters than their fellow Marvel Cinematic Universe directors like James Gunn. It's clear that Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame prioritized their overall directions more. The way these two films take totally contrasting stances with the common theme of inevitability gives each film a unique flavor. Where Infinity War felt like a spiraling fall into calamity, Endgame feels like a desperate crawl towards salvation, eventually leaving a single, inevitable outcome of victory. Ultimately, Endgame seems to outshine its predecessor, but largely because of its impressive setup thanks to Infinity War. Like the first and last acts of the same story, the first builds tension and ends in climax, and the latter manages to bring the climax to a close, rewriting the tragedy of the first, with some major lasting sacrifice still in effect. Truly, there is no better outcome to get us excited for Spiderman: Far From Home!",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","If you like heartbreak laughs and action all in the same movie then this one is for you. The Russo Brothers have done a tremendous job with Avengers Infinity War. it starts off where Thor Ragnarok left off with the big ship which happens to be Thanos' and it keeps you guessing and guessing and begging for more. In the end of the movie you see Thanos snap his fingers with all six Infinity Stones and a lot of people die or so it seems. It keeps you guessing whether or not Thanos is trying to do the right thing by eradicating half the universe. My theory for Avengers 4 is that since they are in the end game, as Doctor Strange calls it, I think that the people who supposedly died are inside the Soul Stone and I believe that Doctor Strange has a plan to get everybody out of the Soul Stone using Ant-Man and the quantum Realm.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","Hello there , after seeing Avengers Infinity War this morning I felt I had to share a fraction of my enthusiasm for this movie. It's a rare thing indeed that a movie lives up to its hype , how often have you went to the cinema only to discover that the best parts are all in the trailer ? Well, fear not , because this is the best Marvel movie so far. The first 5 minutes are awesome and hooks you straight away but hang on because this is truly a roller coaster ride that just speeds up from this point. Whilst some people might worry that at 2 hours 20 , this may be a bum-numbing experience , but rest assured , this movie flies over all too fast and leaves you wanting more . One major advantage this super hero film has over the rest is the main villain, Thanos. This is the first time I can actually remember a murderous tyrant having a rational reason for destroying half a galaxy and Josh Brolin's performance is nothing short of incredible. Seriously , go see this movie NOW before someone reveals the many great scenes or plot twists - YOU WONT BE DISSAPOINTED !!!!!.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

4030,27 April 2018,briggenguy,10," The best superhero movie in film history. Better than the hype.
","I expected this movie to be amazing, and I am glad to say that it somehow EXCEEDED that expectation by a long shot. The balancing between all of the different groups of characters was perfect. I never felt like one group had too much or too little on screen, it's just how Thanos would like it; balanced. Thanos is by far the greatest villain in any superhero movie. He had so much screen time that one could argue it was less about the Avengers and more about Thanos and his journey to destroy half of the Universe. Thanos as a character just had so much depth and character development in this film, which isn't very common in films as most of them only tell us ""they are the evil asshole trying to kill everyone"" and that's it. In this, we get many scenes with him that explain his motivations and his perspective, which really felt like a new thing to me. Moving on, there was not single scene in this film where I felt like the pacing was off, and no scene where I felt bored. The film hooks you in from the very start until the end. The humour in this film is exactly the same as what you would expect from a Guardians of The Galaxy film. When Iron Man called one of The Children of Thanos ""Squidward"" the entire crowd burst into laughter and nobody could stop. It was simply amazing. There is not really any characters that I disliked in this movie which I found incredible considering there is something like 80 characters in this film. If I had to pick, it would have to be maybe Black Widow and Mantis since they really didn't contribute all that much. Speaking of, basically all characters (with a few exceptions) contributed a fair part to the overall plot, which again is hard when you are juggling 80 characters at once. The ending was completely unexpected to say the least. Thanos succeeds in killing half of all life in the Universe, killing characters such as Spiderman, Dr Strange, Black Panther, Nick Fury, and so many more. I know for a fact that they will come back, but despite that, I am very intrigued to see how this all plays out and how they will bring at least some of these characters back. Overall, this movie was everything it needed to be. Congratulations to the directors for making a truly awesome film experience.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","As a comic book fan, and lover of all superheroes, I had somewhat low expectations for this movie. I assumed it would be just fine. How wrong I was. It was completely unexpected, intense, and a complete emotional roller coaster. Although it had several flaws, they were minor and didn't take away from the story. I believe there's a new generation of filmmaking on the horizon, complete with ultra-realistic, virtual-reality graphics, and this movie packs a punch in that department.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018
4037,27 April 2018,rowcoolsville,10," The Unexpected Twists of Fate of Infinity War
","From the beginning of the movie, I knew that this was going to be a hell of a movie. This movie begins with Thor and Hulk's ass being handed to them, defeating 2 of the heavy hitters, giving us a statement: Thanos does not, and I mean DOES NOT mess around and he has no mercy. Hulk is teleported away by Heimdall, and Thanos kills him in retaliation. Shortly after, Thanos demands the Tesseract from Loki, which he is reluctant to give. Thanos threatens to kill Thor if he doesn't receive the Tesseract. Eventually, he gives it up and reveals that a stone lies within the power cube. Thor is subdued, Loki begins to act and tries to kill Thanos but unfortunately, Thanos has now the power of 2 Infinity Stones and easily stops Loki. Commenting about his fake deaths and his power in mischief, Thanos gruesomely kills Loki, sealing his death. Thor is left to mourn his brother and his people, afterwards Thanos destroys the ship and leaves Thor to die. 
All throughout the movie, the characters interact with each other and its nearly perfect how they talk and work together to produce such an amazing team. In a Lord of the Rings sort of way, 3 stories occur, 1 group on Earth, 1 chasing after Thanos and 1 making a weapon that can kill Thanos. In the eve of all the situations, 2 battles occur, one against Thanos, and one against his army and minions/children and those who were making the weapon (Thor, Groot and Rocket) join the battle on Wakanda. Meanwhile, the battle against Thanos reaches a point where the group is able to subdue him, Star-Lord unfortunately learns of Gamora's death and hits Thanos breaking the connection the group has subduing Thanos, with Spider-Man almost removing the Infinity Gauntlet. To our disappointment (in terms of good side winning), Thanos defeats the group and comes close to killing Iron Man but Dr. Strange cuts a deal, Thanos spares Stark and Strange gives the Time Stone to Thanos. 
It comes to rise. One final stone to retrieve, Thanos has 5 and is near invincible. He travels to Wakanda via space portal. The final stand is now here. Everyone with the will to fight tries to stop Thanos but no one can stop him, not even Captain America stopped him, and in return, receives a kick-ass sucker punch from Thanos. It comes to a close, all that lies between Thanos and Vision is Scarlet Witch, and she comes to a hard decision and destroys the Mind Stone (is that even possible? awesome!) and its all over. Thanks however has the Time Stone and is able to reverse time where he revives Vision and rips the Stone from his head, killing Vision. At last, he puts the final Stone in the Gauntlet and with that, he is truly powerful, powerful enough to wipe out half the universe with the snap of his fingers. But WAIT, THERE'S MORE! Thor comes to the rescue and throws his bad-ass axe towards Thanos, nearly killing him at an instant. But as I said, nearly killed him. Thanos snaps his fingers and the goal is completed. Shortly, half the Avengers and nearly all the Guardians die, even Spider-Man fades away, leaving the team and the audience grief stricken.
This movie is truly a great movie, it shows us that heroes don't always win and that sometimes, our emotions and mistakes can get in our way. From all the movies in the MCU, this is the only one (and probably the only one) that has the bad guy win and had him decimate half the freaking universe. Some people may say this ending was expected or cheap, or maybe thats just what the MCU needed, a ending where the good guy doesn't always wins and sometimes evil triumphs over good. This movie is the most anticipated movie of all time because its the cumulation of everything we seen and end it in a way we've never seen in the MCU.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

4051,29 April 2020,heyyquinn,1," Hated the plot, loved the characters and their dialogue
","1. I think this plot was really uncreative, especially compared to Civil War or Winter Soldier... or really any other recent Marvel movie. I ADMIT its amazing to see ALL these superheroes together, I enjoyed their dialogue, and the simultaneous battles were cool, but its wasted on a pointless, lazy plot. Bad guy gonna kill (50% of) everyone. Wow.
2. Why does Thanos care anyway? How does killing 50% of the universe make him feel any better about the fall of his own planet/society? Even Loki's pettiest motives were more solid than Thanos'. Also, why did he ""love"" his ""adopted"" (abducted) daughter more than his blood daughter?
3. This is colonial-imperialist propaganda. Usually Marvel films seem to me critical of the military-industrial complex. But this film promotes the idea that because of the failings of ONE LIFESTYLE - mass industrial society - all forms of life are unsustainable. Not everyone lives like a spoiled American/ect. Some people actually take responsibility for supporting themselves and dont depend on slave-labor from others. Some people don't dump their excess in landfills and oceans.
4. That ending was just cruel and unnecessary for MCU fans.
5. Thor didn't even show any skin. Does he charge extra or what? Thats the least I deserve for enduring that.
6. I'm no prude, but the profanity seems out of place. Who is their target audience? I'm 28, no kids, but it still just felt inappropriate and tacky, for cheap laughs.

We wanted a movie to kick start the Infiity War, and a movie that was great in its own right. I think that's what we got. And it made the original Avengers (an epic movie when it came out) look minuscule in scale. 
Thanos is not just a mindless killing machine. We could even grow to understand him. The other characters may still be in their own box, but that's they way we love them. Despite that, they've all developed over the last 10 years, been through their troubles and triumphs.

","Avengers Infinity War is the spectacular culmination of 18 previous movies over 10 years that exceeded my expectations! As someone who has followed the marvel universe since it's inception, I can say that this film successfully brings together an enormous cast, a remarkable story, twists that will keep you guessing, serious and gut-wrenching dramatic stakes, and an ending that left me both immensely satisfied and yearning for more at the same time! With a cast of this size, I was worried that the film would be confusing or bloated, but the directors jump from story to story in a way that is very easy to follow and each character gets at least one moment to shine! The antagonists of the majority of the previous entries in the marvel cinematic universe have been characters with no real deapth or motivations that don't entirely make sense, but the mad titan Thanos is quite the exception. Thanos sees himself as the hero of his own story and this movie does an excellent job of making the viewer understand why he does what he does and I empathize with him on some level. This movie has a lot of serious and emotional moments that would make sense for the most part if Avengers Infinty War was your first marvel cinematic universe film, but that being said, those moments are highlighted by context from previous entries in the series, and you would not have the same emotional payoffs you would if you possess at least a general knowledge of the marvel universe.

It had the story line that it needed and also multiple aspects within the film from start to finish. It has the must needed action that everyone is desperate to see. And without a doubt you most certainly get that. It has such a drive throughout the film for Thanos to achieve his goal, but the Avenger and GOTG give a good game.
It has outclassed the previoud Avengers and gives you that better build up that everyone has longed for! That's having every superhero who's been on the screen put together. 
To me that film was that good I could never get bored of it and I already want to go and watch it again a thousand times over. The story is that good that you can't help yourself from doing just that.

4094,29 April 2018,rialdiirenius,9," The Sin of Big Movie
","This movie is a conclusion of all marvel cinematic universes movie in the past 10 years and its put it all together very well, but not very neat. It put the heroes on various moment that we can't correlate with. As we know, the main villain, Thanos is a fanatic on his own belief and He tried to make a religion out of this, put his ambition all over the universe whom he believes is the best choice that universe would ever have. But I fail to connect to what Thanos belief, as a good villain must convince what he's doing is probably the best choice for the audience. In the past movie, we don't know Thanos true intention to collect all the rocks for but we know that he is very powerful and his reason must be as powerful as he is, turns out its just incomprehensible obsession over balance.
One thing that felt weird is when Rocket and Groot easily join Thor on his quest considering Rocket's skeptical view on people. It's also strange when the rest GotG flew to Knowhere and trying to stop Thanos while Thor, Rocket, and Groot go on their side quest to create a mighty weapon to destroy Thanos, It's like the Quill's team would face a predestined lost. But to everyone who said that Thor's hammer is freakin' cool, I must agree.
On the other side of the fight, Doctor Strange, Iron Man, and Spider-Man is a great collaboration of fun and glorious fight. The way Doctor Strange fought with his magic is pretty cool and it's like he always has some trick to confuse Thanos while an iron man and spiderman showed their father to son debate which makes a bit of fun on the pretentious moment. 
The fight in Wakanda took a lot of heroes but very little exposure of all of them. It's like when all the triumph moment come it always gone quickly, moving to another main character's scene, I don't feel the fight was set on the Wakanda, it's like the director just changes the scene madly to show the heroes. The plot doesn't make any straight line conclusion, Thanos seems like a confused guy trying to get all his toys, and why the hell Thor just farming on Thanos's crazy monsters not just directly confront him as he always wanted to do in the first place and the main reason he crafted his new weapon.
The biggest wasted potential on this movie is Hulk. Before I see this movie, I think the only guy that would be able to defeat Thanos is the Hulk. But when he's beaten on the Asgardian's ship, I hope that he will get angrier and make an epic comeback on Thanos, even if he's not gonna defeat him, I expect that there is an epic moment of Hulk beating Thanos.
On the end of the movie, the conclusion is not what I expected, but the result is. The story left me nothing to expect on the next movies, so when the movie ended I felt no insurmountable urge to watch the next, it's because the ending of the movie is just like the ending of the Avengers movie.There's no one taken any hostages, no one alive to fight for, and the villain is retired on his tropical hut. The possibility of the next movie all about is as the title of the movie, to avenge, and this time for the dead one.
One thing I felt missing in this movie, the triumph song, it's like the immigrant song on thor Ragnarok and African black panther's theme song. There are a lot of cool moments and if it guided with a compatible back sound, It will bring more ardor to the scene, but instead, it's only a flat monotonous back sound that I may say is the secondary storyteller, besides the scene.
I must appreciate how Russo brothers put the details very neatly despite a great deal of character and story to take care of. And respect given from me to the director when they could still maintain all the characters sways and jokes and made me feel a little bit nostalgic feeling of the past movies and a brief moment of clarity of how big this movie is.
Some people may expect more from this movie, but I can't see another way to feel enjoy the character in any other way. This movie brings the characters personally as it brings all the character as a team. They put the movie on tight chess game with some sacrifice and some winning, making an unexpected move while making sure the ending is inevitable. And I believe for the next movie, the remaining characters won't go easy on Thanos. The Avengers will avenge. That's what they do best.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

The way that this film handles all the main characters is great and and did not expect it to be this way. I honestly can't say this is a film, this is more like a three hours of straight climax which is actually done really well. Another thing that this movie does well are the characters themselves. While some characters get more attention then other (for example War Machine gets a lot less screen time than Iron Man), most of the characters are given adequate screen time. One more note about the characters is that Thanos is genuinely the best character in this movie. He gets the most character development of any Marvel villain and any character in this movie.

","As my brain scrambles from scene to scene in an attempt to relive the significance of its originality I've come to the conclusion that this was everything I expected and more. 
The jump from different city to different planet to different spaceship was relentless but I suppose it just had to be, right? The Russo brothers have given every thought to every single character in this film and has made them all feel as equally as important within the main plot. 
As for that main plot, well Mr. Brolin may have just written is name down in iconic villain folklore alongside the likes of Mr. Vader and that clown from that other universe... He shows us why he is 'the biggest and baddest villain yet' and makes our heroes seem so 'tiny and small'. 
Our heros are as appealing, warm and heroic as ever as they put their differences aside to challenge this apocalyptic threat. There's no time for getting to know each other, it's all hands to the deck right from the off! 
Heading towards the climax the Russo brothers have still managed to keep you guessing right until the grand finale. Then it hits you, like a golden gauntlet to the face!

","I've never seen the need to review anything... let alone rate an app, but this movie was just what the gods ordered. They ticked all the boxes of what I look for in a flick, and then some. Somehow, the directors managed to make the perfect action/adventure/sci-if flick all the while stitching together multitudes of characters, new and old, comedic scenes and heavy action. For me, Winter soldier had good action but felt rushed with too much going on for me to buy into their motives for feuding. Age of Ultron was just a disaster.

","For all the people who rated this movie badly, SHAME ON YOU not Marvel. Every movie doesn't have to be a happy ending with shining rainbows all day round. Infinity War has broken the traditions of having good endings. Thanos is the biggest bad-ass in the universe and YOU SHOULD ACCEPT that fact. Infinity War is basically a Star Wars-esque movie and Marvel did it brilliantly. It is called INFINITY WAR, yes WAR for a reason so the pacing is a little bit faster than usual yet cost us more than 2 hours. If you are a true deep-thinking Marvel fan, Infinity War is basically a new beginning of something bigger than itself. Kudos Marvel.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

","It's COLOSSAL. MONUMENTAL. EPIC! Indeed the biggest Hollywood movie of 2018. It's an EXPERIENCE. Avengers: Infinity War gathers Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Star Lord (Chris Pratt), Spider-man (Tom Holland), Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and the rest of the Avengers together & unite in order to battle their most powerful enemy yet: the evil Thanos (Josh Brolin). On a mission to collect all six Infinity Stones, Thanos plans to use the artifacts to inflict his twisted will on reality. The fate of the planet and existence itself has never been more uncertain as everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this moment.The hype that surrounds the movie is real. You haven't seen a film that puts together 19 of the biggest stars in Hollywood in one mega extravaganza. It's 2 hours & 29 minutes of big cinematic moments after another, with all possible elements of filmmaking combined together to make one gigantic film. You get your fill of action, comedy, suspense & a pinch of touching scenes in between. Like any film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, you also get your fill of fantastic visuals, top notch editing & great cinematography from Trent Opaloch. Alan Silvestri, fresh from the success of Ready Player One, delivers another memorable musical score.Directors Joe & Anthony Russo gives us not only an unforgettable superhero film, but the biggest film of their lives. They also directed one of my favorite films in the MCU (Captain America: Civil War) so rest assured that this movie is in totally good hands. I was literally shookt when the film ended, was not able to stand up even after the end credit scene was shown because I still needed to process what just happened in the whole film. It's that good!

","I actually don't know what to say. This had some uh very big twists. It does not end how you would think with a major comic event happening. Uh my theory was right but I've told very few people so. Let's just say I laughed, I cried tears of joy, W specially when cap came in and the avengers theme played, and I cried tears of sorrow when four legitimate character deaths happened and at they very end when something big happened. Very big. Thanos was well done. He was a very menacing villain, possibly the best MCU villain and is actually relatable. A character we've longed to say again comes back. One we haven't seen in almost a decade, wink wink. The black order was ok. Wished we could have learned more about them but it's ok. A lot of the trailer content was not in the movie. However most of that should be on Blu-ray. A character is teased in the end credit scene but they troll with the usual mod credit scene which is actually not there and the ""this character/team will return"". That honestly was a mixed bag with the other viewers. Highlight was this one guy who saw the solo trailer said wait not on that the fourth when the realest date came up and multiple crying and oh man is that nova, oh it's the defenders form one dude. He was ignorant and also said there are three parts although the Russo brothers stated there are no parts. Each movie can stand alone. And there were multiple NO *cries loudly. So be weary with your audience. The cgi was rough in very few places and acting was good as always and the pairings of the hero's is notable. One being tony and strange. They were a good duo. The movie so many twists I couldn't even explain. I'd have to rewatch the movie before I can explain it. Overall with all the moments where you feel like yelling with joy, my audience as well as I sure did and very loudly on my part, and the multiple crying moments this movie probably deserves a solid 8/10 but with all the actually good things a movie needs like a solid story big surprise out of nowhere and solid pace this as of right now gets a 10/10.

That being said, this is a bad script disguised by great production. There are plot holes everywhere, the ending is unsatisfying, and there is no character development. Thanos is incredibly well done and the backstory is compelling; in contrast, the heroes Marvel has spent so many movies developing and making real and complete fall flat because they have no real development. There is no theme. It is true that the people who are saying there is no plot are wrong- there is a plot, there just isn't any emotional substance behind it. It is action without a compelling story for our heroes.

","Big love from huge fan from Vietnam. I don't care much about people mixed review. All I needed from a perfect movie is here, to conclude all great previous effort of Marvel studio have putted into their fan. Only someone who have time following the cinematic timeline of MCU can truly understand the ultimate meaning of A:IW.
Story: Everything is inter-connected and solid (from objects to characters). The pace is not too fast and not too slow for us (fan) to enjoy it.
*Spoiler Alert*
The movie continues right after ending of Thor: Ragnarok, showing the battle between Thanos's forces and Marvel super heroes (include almost any heroes from previous we have seen so far). Thanos, who looks like a chaotic lawful super-villain. His ultimate purpose is to destroy half-population of entire universe (including Earth) as a solution to over-population on universe which bring so many terrible things to mortal life (such as starvation, planet pollution, resources exhausting, wars for survival....). I can rarely see any movies which can deeply depict into a super-villain this far, to show how their defines justice. Thanos is like a god-like hero in his own right, with extremely will-power and determination to achieve victory over our beloved Marvel superheroes.
I can not say how I feel after so many deaths of our heroes. But to be honest, I am grateful for that, because that means we can see more interesting characters in the future. This is not only a definite meaning to the MCU itself but to Marvel studio and viewers as well.

But that being said, there are a lot of characters in this movie. With many characters that demand much screen time it was definitely a challenge to make sure that happens. I'm guessing that's why the movie was so long. I have nothing but good things to say about this movie. GO WATCH IT. The only negative is that I left the theater feeling that the movie was very crowded...because it was. The movie went all over the place and at some points you could really feel how crowded it was and it distracted you from the film. Other than that it was really well done.

The first is that Infinity War marks the first time that a feature-length movie has been filmed entirely on IMAX cameras.

","Waited till May 11th to see it on IMAX in mainland China. The theatre was filled. The line of people waiting winded outside into the mall. People were excited before they went in, and hyped after they came out. The best cinematic experience ever.
There were indeed a lot of characters, each and everyone of them loved by so many fans, had their moments in the movie. Some has more screen time, some less, but not even one second was bad. All the pieces and moments were good, in a way that it either pushes the story line or build up the characters. 
As someone who's more fond of the original Avengers, I do have some complaints about the Guardians' lengthy journey compared to the short appearance of my beloved Steve Rogers and Black Widow. But if you take the storyline into consideration, the Guardians were indeed more intertwined into the plot. So I understood what the directors wanted to do.
But, again, why can't there be more backstory about what Steve Rogers and Black Widow did after the Civil War? Instead, I had to look at someone eating snacks for over a minute~ I laughed at that scene, but, I still wished that I had seen more of Steve Rogers and Black Widow after waiting sooo long for this Averagers film.

4351,16 July 2018,ddfinn-45488,10," Avengers: Infinity War is possibly the best Marvel film so far!
","Avengers: Infinity War is possibly the best Marvel film yet!
Out of all the Marvel movies that have been released over the last couple years, there are none as special as their last, Avengers: Infinity War. Infinity War is an intense, action-packed film with every superhero in the Marvel Cinematic Universe fighting against the mad titan Thanos. Ever since 2012's The Avengers, Thanos has been a potential threat to the universe. The way that Marvel linked this film with the films in the past is also very impressive. All in all, Infinity War is Marvel's number one masterpiece full of dynamic characters with astonishing chemistry, dramatic, thrilling moments left and right, and an emotional storyline that has consistently built up in the franchise. 
One thing that is instantly noticed are the amount of characters in the film. Almost everyone in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is in Infinity War. Having all these famous characters like Thor, Thanos, and Iron Man combined into one film is both awesome and breathtaking. Not only do all these characters connect with one another, they also have amazing chemistry. For example, every scene with Tony Stark and Dr. Stephen Strange are both hilarious and intense because both of their personalities are very alike, therefore, creating a clash. Marvel does a very good job grouping these characters, both alike and different, together to make the audience laugh and fall in love with these characters even more. 
Marvel movies are always known for their suspenseful moments of action and heroism. What's nice about Infinity War is that there are so many characters that have their own fight scenes. For example, there is a scene where Captain America, Black Widow, and Falcon fight two members of the Black Order, while another has Spider-man, Iron Man, The Guardians of the Galaxy, and Dr. Stephen Strange taking on Thanos. The fact that everyone is fighting to save the universe against only one villain makes it even better. Not only is Thanos one of the most known villains in the Marvel Universe, he is also the most misunderstood villain. 
Thanos is a very complicated character to understand. He is always seen as this evil tyrant who wants to wipe out half universe, but, if you really try and look at it from his point of view, you may think otherwise. There is a scene in the film where Thanos and Dr. Stephen Strange are having a conversation. Thanos uses the stone of reality to show Strange that he was born on the planet Titan and how it's corruption led to its demise. He reflects his possible solutions on how he could've saved Titan, but it's genocide. Strange says to Thanos, ""Congratulations, you're a prophet."" ""I'm a survivor."" Thanos states. ""Who wants to murder trillions!"" says Strange. Thanos says to Strange, ""With all six stones I can simply snap my fingers, and they would all cease to exist and I call that mercy."" This shows that in Thanos' eyes, he is doing the universe a favor. He believes that the universe needs to be balanced, even if it comes down to wiping out half the universe with a single snap of his fingers.

A fresh creation from the Russo brothers who excellenty craft a film of immense build up and hype around it. They effortlessly get the best from their cast, many of whom who have not had on screen interactions together. The result is a massively enjoyable journey in which you're given moments of hunour, joy and the inevitable sadness. The on screen cast of what may be the best ensemble cast of our time, works incredibly well with chemistry which for some takes two or three films to develop. Infinity war delivers, whether your a lifelong fan of marvel stemming from the comics, the MCU or quite simply a one off movie goer this film is a delight. Marvel have created something fresh and just as exciting, if not more so than the first Iron Man movie ten years ago. Thanos is without a doubt the best MCU villain, making all who come before him look like a weak pretender and he the true big bad. The Russo Brother's portrayal of him is perfect, instead of him being 'Mad' the way he is in the comics. They attempt to humanise the mad titan, almost making you undertand his goals, almost. Josh Brolin's performance is brilliant, his delivery of the lines makes Thanos a modern day Darth Vader. A being torn by his beliefs into something so twisted that nothing will get in his way. The tone of the film was perfect, hopelesness was looming over all but despite this our Avengers never give up. For the pressue from inside and outside for this film to succeed, the Russo brothers deliver an effortlessly crafted masterpiece. That has rasied the bar for all over superhero films that will follow it. Bravo to all involved. As this behemoth culmination of work, leads to the best superhero film of our time. 
Well, until Avengers 4 perhaps. 
Go and see this film, you will not be dissatisfied.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

I have to say that the Guardians of the Galaxy are as whacky and funny as ever but when it comes down to it, they get serious and tough.

What can I say about this film?This film has a great pace despite being longer than 150 minutes and also being the longest film in the MCU. This film overall is GREAT,the pacing,most of the comedy,the action,the drama,the tension and the romance was suprisingly handled well. Okay so Thanos might be the most intimidating comic book film villain of all time and he in my opinion is the best MCU villain. But,there is a number of flaws which are some of the comedy does not land,some of the subplots felt rushed and the other flaws I will not get into because I would be spoiling the movie already.

","If you're not a fan of the MCU or Marvel you'll be losing of the best of experience you could ever have at the cinema. The Russo Brothers made a masterpiece. The best movie in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe. 
Right off the bat, the movie starts with a lot of power and engages you immediately, there's time to breathe during the first half with a joke here and there but after that hour has passed, the tension just keeps on building and it doesn't break even after the movie has ended. 
Josh Brolin was an amazing Thanos, as he nails the role so perfectly. Always the most overpowering, intimidating and fear-provoking character in the room. This is the first time you can feel that the Avengers are going to have a struggle finishing their task and lose some of their integrants knowing they have to give it their all due to what there's at stake.
Every single actor in this movie (Downey Jr., Cumberbatch, Holland, Ruffalo, Olsen, Johansson, Pratt, Bautista, etc.) does their respective character so well and the outstanding dialogue just makes it that much better of a performance. Got to give props for the Russo Brothers at how they manage to handle every single Avenger sufficient screen-time without leaving us needing more or less of one superhero with already an enormous cast.
One of the things I loved and hated about this movie was ending. The finale was such an amazing part of the story. You literally cannot know what's going to happen after the events presented in this film which makes it that much better.

4442,27 April 2018,imthahulk-09763,8," Good for scale and quite a bit of fun!
","Avengers Infinity War was based of the 1991 publication Infinity Gauntlet. In terms of scale, the movie was done well to translate to the big screen. There's no way it could have been done as it played out in the comics as the latter series of Infinity Gauntlet involved Marvel's comics entities(Eternity, Galacticus, The Watchers, The Celestials, etc...) and that would have been way too much. Although it would be very cool to have one or two show up in the final installment to say lend a helping hand and receive and introduction into the MCU. I've read other reviews where it stated that certain deaths lacked emotional punch as they were killed or eliminated only to have their deaths reversed in the final installment. Well, that's how it works in the comics. Death has way since been handled as temporary in both Marvel and DC comics. The other deaths that appeared to be more permanent were done well and I doubt those characters will resurface. There were some characters whose power sets seemed to get amped up quite a bit, i.e. Captain America while others seemed dialed down. Therefore, the way they were handled in battle made them seem a bit like some baby Hulks. And given how formidable Thanos would be with just one stone, the battle sequences were done well to provide the viewer with a sense of legitimacy. Because as shown in the comics, he could have easily defeated many of the characters in the movie with one or two stones, let alone five as he had when he arrived on Earth. I thought Thor's arc was handled well and he was finally given some scenes that actually provide some insight on his true power set and what he is capable of. So outside of the ignant mofos that sat behind and talked most of the movie, it was quite an enjoyable bit of escapism. Thanos was believable and given how much had to be played out in the movie, his character was well done with just enough character development to understand his motivation. The 2 hour 40 minute running time seems to fly by. It's pretty much 0-60 within the first 10 minutes of the movie. So give it a go. If you're a fan boy, you'll understand why much of the movie was shot and made the way it was. Those who don't read comics may have a harder time suspended their sense of belief. Titan was shown as more of a planet as opposed to a moon which it is. That Earthlings could survive on a moon of Saturn without some type of armor or space gear is beyond me. But maybe I'm nitpicking. Go check it out, you'll enjoy yourself.",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018

4445,27 April 2018,tidamadzikanda,10," I didn't know how to feel about the ending.........
","Avengers: Infinity Wars, is an epic saga from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as the Avengers rebel against the existential threat that is the overwhelming might of the supreme Thanos
The heroes of the narrative (Downey, Pratt, Johansson and the rest of the gang) are in excellent fighting form (as per usual) and bring undertones of organic humour (particularly Ruffalo and Holland) to balance the impending doom. 
Brolin's, Thanos is an infallible, and unmatched talent among previous Marvel Cinematic Universe villains. The leading antagonist (Brolin) could potentially challenge Heath Ledger's maniacal depiction of the Joker. This is not because Thanos is a megalomaniac and indomitable being, but his excellency lies rational. He is deft and absolute in both words and actions. He displays something inexplicably and hauntingly human about him. Thus, making him a fully realized anti-hero.
Alan Silvestri's beautiful layered soundtrack heightens the emotional intensity of the Avengers greatest threat to date. His ability to capture the constantly changing tone and as the inextricably linked narrative jumps from place to place is deserving of praise. 
The Russo's Infinity Wars (Part 1) is sure to become a pop culture reference of the future, as they have managed to achieve with the Thanos and the Avengers what Bryan Singer failed to do with Apocalypse (a character of banal platitude) and the X-Men. But we are left with our appetites unsated, and waiting with both repressed clamour and bated breath for the conclusion of the enthralling and dynamic journey in 2019.

This is a fitting and respectable way to end the series and I hope the studio is able to resist any temptation to make more films. Definitely the best Avengers movie and hopefully the last. Don't get me wrong. I have loved the Avengers movies from the very beginning, but just like our lives and most probably the Universe (which will definitively happen much later than our insignificant planet is dead and gone) will come to an end one day, so should this series. And there's no more fitting way to do it than the way it was done in Infinity War, with Thanos sitting calm and relaxed, watching the horizon after a job well done. It was a tough job, but someone had to do it. And, as Thanos already hinted at the end of the movie Age of Ultron, the good old saying also applies to balancing the Universe. If you want something done well, you need to do it yourself. And boy did he do it well! I don't usually give a 10, but this was sheer perfection. Although, the 10 is conditional on the studio ending it here. Thanks again Marvel. This was true shock and awe!",/review/rw4152877/?ref_=tt_urv,Avengers_Infinity_War_2018
