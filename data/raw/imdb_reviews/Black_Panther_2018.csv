I stayed with it to the bitter end but found little to make it unique among its Marvel brotherhood. If anything, it pulled in every cliche one could think of, having a black hero.

","""Black Panther"" is a great deception for any viewer with brains. The hype creates expectation but the film is absolutely overrated. The plot and the characters are shallow and senseless. The Wakanda society accepts the dispute for the kingdom between the outsider Erik Killmonger and T'Challa without any plebiscite. The villain defeats T'Challa is a fair fight as per the Rules. Then Tchalla´s mother, sister and girlfriend recover him using the powerful plant destined to Wakanda kings. And T'Challa returns to Wakanda in a coup d'état, destroying the aircrafts sent by Killmonger to the spies. W'Kabi and his army support Killmonger and in the end, it seems that everything is all right in Wakanda that seems to have a great division between the social classes.

","This is my second attempt to review this title. 
I was able to see a screening of this in Europe...waste of time. Predictable and laughable at points, it desperately tries to keep pace with other Marvel offerings but fails miserably. The storyline begins with an extremely promising origin for the characters but instead of capitalizing on this and building on it we move to forced action sequences that are poorly done (horrible CGI). That's where the attempt to keep pace with other Marvel and DC offerings becomes obvious...cliché phrases and over the top reaches to create new ones. Some borrowing from previous Marvel ""technology"" really tried to claim it to it's own, but was sadly obvious. Jordan did an outstanding job portraying Erik Killmonger and Whitaker was great, as always...the rest of the cast fell miles short of bringing these characters to life. It's okay to act with a chip on your shoulder because THAT'S what make hero characters pop...BUT you must act first.

","Superhero movies never get a fair shake. There's always been an invisible - but undeniable - whiff of critical disdain attached to films revolving around people with superhuman abilities. More often than not, these films are viewed (and assessed) as popcorn entertainment: good fun, but not objectively good.

Although this has been championed as one of they greatest diverse films it is not and I would recommend you to check out '12 years a Slave' , 'Get Out' or 'Moonlight' who do a much better job than this meager attempt. The plot is by the numbers the direction is nothing special. Chadwick Boseman's acting is rather stilted and you can never attach to his character. Michael B Jordan is a one note villian who also struggles, phoning in a performance spouting monologues about messages that never really click. But where the movie really falls on its face is the third act which is cgi heavy and looks like its out of a video game.

","A groundbreaking magnum opus of cinematic marketing for African-Americans, ""Creed"" director Ryan Coogler's ""Black Panther"" (** OUT OF ****) has demonstrated the impact that a film can create when a single demographic embraces it. The 18th Marvel Studios superhero saga has coined over a billion dollars. Apart from the R-rated Marvel Comics ""Blade"" trilogy, African-Americans have waited patiently for a suitable larger-than-life champion with a PG-13 rating. A largely derivative but a polished escapade from start to finish, ""Black Panther"" amounts to a standard-issue, Panther malice-in-the-palace melodrama. The generational gap in the skewered relationship between father and son in director Ryan Coogler and Joe Robert Cole's screenplay provides this epic with its most thematically compelling material. The son spends most of his time handling the mistakes that his short-sighted father has made. The secret fantasy kingdom of Wakanda shares some similarities with the clandestine island in ""Wonder Woman."" Basically, ""Black"" constitutes an origins story about a hero in a cat-suit with ears and his homeland. Mind you, this isn't the first time Black Panther has graced the silver screen. He made his debut in the contrived and drawn-out ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016) where the Avengers broke ranks and swore loyalty to either Captain America or Iron Man. Chadwick Boseman exhibits the steadfast confidence and physical agility to play Marvel Comic's first African-born superhero. Unfortunately, since he is not only a king, but also a politician who symbolizes the status quo, he seems hopelessly bland and straightforward. Boseman needs to jettison the pseudo-African accent that he uses as Prince T'Challa because it sounds synthetic. Comparably, Michael B. Jordan emerges as far more appealing than a ruthless adversary should. As an illegitimate ghetto offspring of Wakandan blood, the charismatic Jordan spouts the minimal number of profanities allowed for a PG-13 rating. Similarly, the dynamic women who surround Black Panther as his elite bodyguard are far more exciting than the ruler they shield from danger. ",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","""Black Panther"" is a new American movie that makes it quite comfortably past the 2-hour mark and here we have the most recent addition to the Marvel universe as in the face of the topic of racism that is still oh so dominant (really more than it should be as we are living in very tolerant times) we get the first Black superhero movie in a long time. Ryan Coogler directs and he is also part of the writing squad. I would say that by including a main antagonist here that is also Black they took some racial tension out here, but if you look at the political history of America and the Black Panthers, it may not be the wisest move to go with this animal. Besides, I felt there was far from sufficient elaboration why they did. The dream sequence with the father being a panther now that he is dead alone wasn't enough for sure. Another slightly controversial decision that the main antagonist is an American megalomaniac was not the most sensitive either. But luckily, there are also enough positive things to mention here. Technically, the film is on a pretty high level in terms of sound and visual effects, there is no reason to say it isn't on par with other Marvel stuff from recent history. Also the film shows that you don't need characters from previous Marvel films to succeed the way they included Hulk most recently in Thor 3. And Boseman in the lead does a pretty good job like everybody else almost, certainly better than Cumberbatch for example. The one exception here is Kaluuya whose character did almost nothing for me and whose performance rang pretty false too on several occasions. The one who made up for that was Andy Serkis, who was great fun to watch and perhaps the best thing about the movie, one of not too many white performers here, who were mostly included for comedic (not entirely) situations. This description also fits Martin Freeman's role and he was the same as usual sadly, but luckily his material was good without being too challenging, so it worked.

3. Boring action - if you can manage to put up with the boring dialogue, then there's little to gain from the action. Very average at best, something you would expect in a TV episode.

","Now, I'm just gonna lay it out there even though it's an unpopular review but I found the movie, uhm, just good.

I've been trying to figure out why it didn't do it for me, and I'm not sure maybe it's because it comes right after Thor Ragnarok (best MCU movie so far), or it comes before Infinity War (we've all seen the trailer, like give it to us already!) I feel the first 30 minutes or so was a drag, albeit the cinematography and costumes were astounding (google the Filipino influence on the female warriors' costume), but was necessary in order to setup the movie but I didn't get reeled in until maybe Laetitia Wright as Shuri, the black princess (Disney's 2nd, progress!) that can give Tony Stark a run for his money (literally and figuratively) showed up and somewhat stole the show. Danai Gurira imposed herself very well as Okoye, Black Panther's General and leader of the fierce all-female badass army Dora Milaje. Lupita Nyong'o held her own as the requisite ""damsel in distress"", Daniel Kaluuya as BP's right hand man (hated him but still love him) and last but not the least, Michael B.

78,21 February 2018,The-Sarkologist,5," More of the Same
","Once again I probably shouldn't get too excited over movies that I see trailers for because I an inevitably disappointed. Then again, I've probably reached the age where seeing a movie is just another of the endless number of processes that I go through, and since I have seen so many of them many of them cease to be all that interesting anymore. As they say in South-East Asia, when it comes to movies they are pretty much all same same (but different).
 I guess that is what the case was with regards to Black Panther - it was pretty much same same. In fact, in a way, it reminded my somewhat of The Phantom, though that probably has more to do with there always being a person around to take the mantle of the Black Panther, though in this case it is the king of Wakunda. The story goes that a meteorite hit Africa and five warring tribes discovered the power of the minerals in the meteorite and decided to come together as a kingdom. However, they also chose to shut themselves off from the world, and for most of history have been hidden from the eyes of everybody else. In their mind Wakunda is basically just another basketcase African country.
 Okay, there is a little twist in the plot, but in the end it is one of those good guy vs bad guy movies. Basically a prince of Wakunda betrays the country and is killed. His son then decides to seek out revenge, comes back to the country, challenges the king and wins. The king (who is also the Black Panther) then recovers from his wounds and returns to take back his throne, and I suspect you can work out where it goes from there. However, there is one theme that runs through the film, and that is how they should use their technology - should they help the world, or should they continue to sit back and watch.
 This isn't really much of an issue in the globalised world in which we now live, but I guess there is always that question of how one should interact with the world. The thing is that since Wakunda is an African nation, there is a lot of debate within the nation as to how they should react, considering that Africans tend to be, in the most cases, at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder. Yet, it also seems to be a debate between arming them or hiding, yet there is also the possibility of there being a third way - using one's technology to educate them.
 Of course the problem with education is that one needs to want to be educated, because if one doesn't want to be educated then there is going to be a bit of an issue. Still, that isn't really what the film is about, but rather how they should interact with the world. Of course, when one is hiding away in their own little bubble, one fails to see the reality of what is beyond one's borders. This is why many of those who leave Wakunda as spies end up being challenged by what they see, and becoming angry at the failure of the Wakundans to actually do anything about it.
 Anyway, the film wasn't bad, though it did drag on a bit. Interestingly it seems to be set apart from many of the other Marvel films in that the focus is entirely upon the Black Panther - none of the other regulars make an appearance (except for Stan Lee, but he makes a cameo in pretty much all of the films). In a way they may had done it that way so as not to tie to too much into the timeline at this stage (particularly since the Black Panther does change with the king).",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

There are many fine actors in this piece, including Chadwick as the hero-guy. BUT, being a good actor doesn't mean you have the ability to carry a film as a lead. Hollywood of old used to call it the ""it"" factor, a better word would be charisma. Jordan as the heavy does have the ""it"" factor, which is not good for the film to have the villain with more than the hero.

","Black Panther is the story of a king with super powers whose throne gets questioned by someone who sees themselves as the rightful heir to the throne. Chadwick Boseman plays T'Challa in this film who is the King of wakanda, an African Country that is hidden by technology. Michael B. Jordan plays a kid a kid from California, Erik Killmonger, who believes that he has been cheated from the throne and decides that he will challenge T'Challa for it. These characters both want to prove they are not possers of the power and are not pushovers.
This movie was fairly entertaining, it had very good visual effects and fun action scenes. The movie just didn't hit that big not for me that it seemed to by everyone else. I had fun watching the film but I didn't think that it was great in anysense if the matter. The story seemed like a very played out of a man who thinks he should be king so he fights the king for it, just with superpowers. It was fun but again just not the best superhero film of the year or the past couple of years.
This movie came out early last year following the huge buzz that was Captain America: Civil War, where the Black Panther was introduced. The movie didn't need to be another origin story and it wasn't so I give props to the filmmakers for that part of it. I just do not see how this movie got nominated for an oscar, all of the performances were fine, the dialogue was fine and the story was fine.
All aspects of this film were done great, I believe with the script that the movie had it did the best it could on every level. The editing and sound were put together well to create seamless scenes and fights. All of the dialogue seemed real, for the most part. Not that the lines weren't written well, but the film takes place in an African Country and have been in that country forever, advancing far past the world, and staying hidden, but they all speak english. This is something that bothers me in a lot of movies, it might be very convenient but why don't they speak some African language, they have accents. Even the tribe that lives up into the mountains who seem to be a little primitive, when looking at how far they have advanced looking at how the other tribes have, they speak english as well throughout the film. Other than that though technically this film is very well done.
Going through and watching this film There was a scene that I really enjoyed, the scene in which Erik challenges T'Challa for his throne. The scene takes place in the throne room, Erik is taken into the the room where he is being prosecuted. Only to find out that his has rights to be the King of Wakanda and the Black Panther. The camera use in this scene is very minimal, just cuts to who is talking going back and forth. It is a very common technique used to just show what everyone's thinking and feeling and that was probably the best way to go with this scene as what was happening was shocking a lot of people so all of their emotions. There is nothing notable about the lighting, the scene is in a room with a big window during the day so you can see everyone's face well. What I like about this scene is something that has been done a million times over is the build up with music until you find out what Erik was hiddining from them when he revealed his blood right and that he wanted to be the king. Just a simple build up in music before that delivery was done well. The pacing in this scene was fun to watch everything seemed fine and going a nice pace, then once they start to exchange information back and forth the camera cuts begin to speed up. From this scene which has no action you can see that on a technical aspect there are zero problems with this film. Another problem this film didn't have was acting, there was an all star cast. Everyone does really well to make their character believable and give true emotions for what is happening and what might happen for them in the future.
I have only seen this film three times, in the theaters, once when I caught it on tv and when I just rewatched it this week to give a review, I do not have that big of a problem with the film, I am not a big fan of it though, as I have said I think that there are better superhero films, even better redemption films, which is a big element of this movie.
With all of these different grips with the movie i do not want to give the impression that I hate this movie, just a tad bit overrated. I enjoyed it for the most part and if you like the films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe than you would probably enjoy this film as well. If i was tot give this a film a rating from one to ten I would say 6/10. It was good on a technical scale but it was an overused story.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","I felt guilty disliking ""Black Panther' because, like ""Wonder Woman"" (2017), there was so much media focus on the supposed social significance of the film. The entire plot revolves around 'vibranium', a fictional unobtainium-like element in the MCU, out of which you can make anything that the plot requires or that would look cool on film. Wakanda, a hidden paradise in the heart of Africa, sits on a mountain of the miracle metal and therefore has technology, including weaponry, far beyond anything else on the planet (outside of Tony Stark's workshop and similar MCU hero/villain enclaves). The Black Panther is the super-powered king of Wakanda, whose costume can be stored in a necklace, allowing him to change instantly (where his civilian clothes go is not clear to me, but certainly the tightfitting cat suit can't be worn over his Savile Road suit) and, as The Black Panther, he can do pretty much anything (regardless of physics). Despite its sophisticated technology, the rulership of Wakenda is decided by brawling, so we end up with two Black Panthers: a good one and an evil one (maybe semi-evil, as he seems to be possessed by murderous good-intent if you are a fan of race-wars). Needless to say, this narrative bifurcation is resolved by a huge melee and a Black Panther mano a mano (easily the worst part of the film from a CGI perspective). Even by MCU standards, most of the characters are pretty much cut-out dolls (especially T'Challa's trite Q-like sister) with the exception of Micheal B. Gordons ""Kill Monger"", an implausible but at least interesting character. As these sorts of movies go, 'The Black Panther' is fine. The look is novel but the script and story are pretty typical of the genre, so perhaps ground breaking in the sociocultural world of big-budget comic book adaptations but otherwise, not much new. Maybe I just don't get it, but Wakanda is this incredibly wealthy enclave in Africa but these elite 1%ers don't seem willing to do anything to help out their troubled continent. I can accept ethical reasons for not using their hyper-advanced weaponry to solve Africa's problems but there seems little excuse not to surreptitiously assist with their hyper-advanced medical technology (I suspect that these are awkward questions best avoided in a movie based on a comic book in which they are the 'good guys').",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","Since it was nominated for best film at the Oscars this movie was on my "" must watch"" list for a long time, though I must admit I am no fan of Marvel cinematic universe movies. The main attraction besides the production values, sets and special effects is obviously the late Chadwick Boseman who has delivered a memorable performance as King T'Challa who has taken over duties of King of an African nation Wakanda after the death of his father. His ascent to the throne is challenged by a a tribe leader M'Baku, a duel is fought and Chadwick emerges victorious. But all is not smooth sailing for him as there are a number of impediments. Wakanda is technically advanced due the extensive use of a modern metal called vibranium. The movie is a thrilling mix of the old and the new with a mix of African tribes with protocol, a CIA operative, London city museum , gambling tables of night clubs, high speed car chases and crashes all made exciting with special effects and technical wizardry. Where there is burning ambition there are bound to be plottings and palace intrigues and both are in plenty. The attraction is the hand to hand fight sequence in knee deep water watched by many against a picturesque backdrop of cliffs and waterfalls. This remains a highlight of the movie. Definitely a movie worth sitting through as it transports you to another world. Some superior acting from Chadwick Boseman supported by Daniel Kaluuya, Lupita Nyong'o and Forest Whitaker. It was in later years that Chadwick got the Oscar posthumously for "" Ma Rainey's Black Bottom "" and Daniel Kaluuya got the Oscar for ""Judas and the black messiah"" .

These people hide the secrets to prosperity away from the world and call anyone who doesn't live with them an ""outsider"". They determine their leaders via either birthright or by combat (extremely advanced stuff from the Wakandans). Maybe if they didn't just pick the strongest guy they could have had a leader with morals make some positive changes to the world, instead their xenophobia causes them to sit and watch people suffer and die all over but they choose to save a hobbit just because. Then the hobbit flies a plane-ship simulation and takes out Killmonger's aerial force by himself and all this time another ship is trying to kill him. The movie sets it up as a life or death decision for Mr. Baggins; choose to stay in the simulation and die fighting or leave and let the enemy win. He chooses to stay and fight but somehow gets out in the nick of time anyways; just a complete waste of time to even present the illusion of risk. Oh, and how the hell is the hobbit supposed to know how much time he has left when he's told ""shields are at 50%"", what does that even mean?

Everything about this movie was phenomenal. The special effects were obviously mind blowing, but the acting was the absolute best part. I never saw a comic book movie with this much powerhouse performances. They all did so good, I will see this movie again and again. I can't wait for sequels! Also so proud of Ryan Coogler for breaking all the stereotypes and painting the most gorgeous picture of African life, and everything it can be. Such a riveting story from start to end.

186,17 February 2018,Thekeybaldemasterrises,9," Went in expecting a decent action movie, got so much more than that.
","Marvel always surprises me when I think they've run out of steam. Black Panther is what the 18th movie they've done? There seems to be no sign of them slowing down anytime soon, and for good reason. With the industry scrambling to find the next big cinematic universe/comic book franchise, there will never be another like what Marvel Studios has accomplished. We had Iron Man all the way back in 2008 and I never would've thought 10 years from then we'd be watching a Black Panther movie. I wasn't expecting much going into it, I figured it would be a decent action movie with a pretty familiar plot. In some ways it was, but in some ways it actually wasn't. These movies tend to fall under a pretty general third act with hero vs villain so I wasn't too thrilled by that part, but at least the action was well done so I let it slide. If anyone does anything like Fan4stick or Man of Steel ever again I'll walk out before it's even over. What Black Panther really shines in is it's world building through breaking the cultural barrier, I wondered going in how they were going to address the fact that Wakanda was this technological utopia when there are so many third world countries barely staying together. The answers they gave were satisfying at least for a comic book movie. You have a strong villain who's fueled with this hatred against the world for how they've treated African people and how Wakanda in has stood to the side all these years. Trying to not get involved of the obstacles African people are constantly struggling with all over the world. It's doing a lot right and I'm glad they took the time to tell a meaningful story that doesn't necessarily force a bridge into more movies, but rather contribute to the constant evolving world. By the end the characters make a decision that promises some interesting directions and possibilities and I'm genuinely curious to see where they could take it. Overall this movie was pretty satisfying. Great direction, performances, and plenty of popcorn action for a good time. If you enjoy these movies, obviously go see it, If you don't then I guess don't? I'm a bit surprised people are accusing positive reviews of being afraid to express their true opinions because they don't wanna come off as racist or offensive against SJW. But then again this is the internet so who am I kidding. We live in a day and age where people are looking to stand out online trying to look hip by saying the movie sucks because it's boring and what not. If you're going to critique something actually put some effort into it. Strip away the visuals and performances, then you got a pretty generic superhero story I agree, but what matters is the execution and effort they put into it. These movies are not Citizen Kane they're popcorn movies but they do a decent job that actually deserves the praise. There's a line T'chaka has in here about not building barriers but opening them and how we have to look after one another like we're a single tribe, humanity. The haters of Black Panther know I'm telling the truth and are going to downvote this review because they don't like people supporting Disney and their ""SJW agendas"".

The problem is that it kind of lacked this groundbreaking substance that we're being led to believe is there. The concept is great, but I just didn't feel like there was adequate character development to get you really invested in the ideological clash and manner of resolution they were working toward. For that reason I didn't leave feeling as uplifted as I could have for the theme that was used. It was just kind of, ""oh, alright...well he's a really decent human being.""

257,18 February 2018,Troy_Campbell,6," Politically relevant, but ultimately mid-tier Marvel.
","The hype surrounding Marvel's newest cinematic instalment was stratospheric. A predominantly African-American cast and crew generated the initial publicity, then a knockout trailer turned that buzz into genuine excitement. Perhaps with such high expectations it was always going to be difficult for writer-director Ryan Coogler to deliver; the timely political themes, big-budget blockbuster requirements and Marvel connectivity all vying for his attention. Let's get the bad news out of the way: the action is underwhelming. There are a few decent sequences-a casino showdown boasts an ambitious unbroken tracking shot, a ritualistic cliff-side clash between two major characters is brutal-however, the set pieces largely leave a lot to be desired. Majority of the action is a blur of choppy editing and dimly lit cinematography, making it hard to appreciate both the choreography and geography of the fighting, whilst the finale is a disappointingly banal battle featuring, wait for it, CGI rhinos. Where this movie thrives though, is in its story and characters. Undoubtedly the MCU's most politically relevant instalment, the central plot revolves around oppression, equality, power-sharing and class, all tied up into a potent narrative that gives its characters room to breathe and grow. As the eponymous hero from Wakanda, Chadwick Boseman is endearing as a confident but conflicted King T'Challa, while his opposing force Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) is riveting as an unstoppable tornado of fury and revenge. Yet this film also gives us three of the strongest female characters of the franchise: Lupita Nyong'o as royal spy Nakia, Danai Gurira as fierce warrior Okoye, and Letitia Wright as exuberant tech-wizard Shuri. More often than not it's this trio who make the sound decisions, save the hero and kick some serious arse. Credit to Coogler and his crew for successfully weaving in so much African culture too. The stunning production design and costuming combines traditional African symbology with the high-tech world, whilst the score is a low-key fusion of hip-hop, customary African tunes and standard orchestral overtones. Its social and political commentary gives Black Panther a pertinence and edge most MCU flicks don't have, but as an action blockbuster it's merely mid-tier Marvel.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","The leading hero of this next instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe made his first appearance in Captain America: Civil War, his solo movie is seen as an important superhero movie, opening the door to black leading heroes, directed by Ryan Coogler (Creed). Basically centuries ago, five African tribes war over a meteorite containing vibranium, one warrior ingests a ""heart-shaped herb"" affected by the metal and gains superhuman abilities, becoming the first ""Black Panther"". He unites all but the Jabari Tribe to form the nation of Wakanda, the Wakandans use the vibranium to develop advanced technology and pose as a Third World country to isolate themselves from the world. In 1992, King T'Chaka (John Kani) visits his undercover brother N'Jobu (Sterling K. Brown) in Oakland, California. T'Chaka accuses N'Jobu of assisting black-market arms dealer Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) with stealing vibranium from Wakanda. N'Jobu's partner reveals he is Zuri (Denzel Whitaker), another undercover Wakandan, and confirms T'Chaka's suspicions. In the present day, following the death of T'Chaka, his son T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) returns to Wakanda to assume the throne, and to become the next Black Panther. Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), T'Challa's ex-lover from an undercover assignment, Okoye (Danai Gurira), the leader of the Dora Milaje regiment, his mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett) and younger sister Shuri (Letitia Wright) all attend the coronation. At the ceremony, the Jabari Tribe's leader M'Baku (Winston Duke) challenges T'Challa for the crown in ritual combat, T'Challa defeats M'Baku and convinces him to yield rather than die. After Klaue and Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens (Michael B. Jordan) steal a Wakandan artifact from a museum, T'Challa's friend and Okoye's lover W'Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya) urges him to bring Klaue back dead or alive. T'Challa, Okoye, and Nakia travel to Busan, South Korea where Klaue plans to sell the artifact to CIA agent Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman), a firefight breaks out and Klaue tries to escape, T'Challa catches him, he reluctantly allows Ross to take him into custody. Klaue tells Ross that Wakanda's international image is a front for a technologically advanced civilization, Erik attacks and extracts Klaue, Ross is severely protecting Nakia, T'Challa decides to save Ross rather than pursuing Klaue, taking him to Wakanda. While Shuri heals Ross, T'Challa confronts Zuri (Forest Whitaker) about N'Jobu, Zuri explains that N'Jobu planned to share Wakanda's technology with people of African descent around the world and take it over. As T'Chaka arrested N'Jobu, N'Jobu attacked Zuri, forcing T'Chaka to kill him, they covered up the fact that they had left behind N'Jobu's American son, Erik, who became a U. S. black ops soldier. Meanwhile Killmonger, aka N'Jadaka, kills Klaue and takes his body to Wakanda, he stands before the tribe elders, revealing his identity and claiming to be the true heir to the throne. Killmonger challenges T'Challa to ritual combat; after killing Zuri, he defeats T'Challa and hurls him over a waterfall. Killmonger ingests the heart-shaped herb, Killmonger orders the rest are incinerated, but Nakia extracts one first, supported by W'Kabi and his army, Killmonger prepares to distribute shipments of Wakandan weapons around the world. Nakia, Shuri, Ramonda and Ross go to the Jabari Tribe for help, there they find T'Challa who was rescued and is in a coma, he is healed by Nakia's herb. T'Challa returns to fight Killmonger, who dons his own Black Panther suit and commands W'Kabi and his army to attack T'Challa. Shuri, Nakia, and the Dora Milaje join T'Challa, while Ross remotely pilots a jet and takes down the planes carrying the vibranium weapons, M'Baku and the Jabari arrive to reinforce T'Challa. Confronted by Okoye, W'Kabi and his army stand down, T'Challa fights Killmonger in Wakanda's vibranium mine, Killmonger's suit is disrupted and T'Challa stabs him, Killmonger refuses to be healed, choosing to die a free man rather than be incarcerated. T'Challa establishes an outreach center at the building where N'Jobu died to be run by Nakia and Shuri, and T'Challa appears before the United Nations to reveal Wakanda's true nature to the world. In a post-credits sequence, Shuri is with Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) who is in recuperation. Also starring Florence Kasumba as Ayo and Stan Lee as Thirsty Gambler. Boseman is a good choice as the hero, Jordan is a fairly good villain, and there is great support from Wright, Gurira, Serkis, Freeman and others, most putting on convincing South African or American accents, the story is maybe a little complicated at times, but there enough exciting chase and explosive sequences, filled with fantastic special effects, to keep you engaged, and it is also a good exploration of African culture, a worthwhile superhero action adventure. It won the Oscars for Best Original Score for Ludwig Göransson, Best Costume Design, and Best Production Design, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Original Song for ""All the Stars"" (also won the Golden Globe), Best Sound Editing, and Best Sound Mixing, it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and Best Original Score.

","The movie was just mediocre. It's ridiculously overrated, and everyone knows why at this point. The movie, just like a decent amount of other marvel movies, is predictable, boring, and bland. Lets start with some good things about the movie. The setup of Wakanda in the movie is just amazing. The detail, the environment, the costume design, and just everything about it is just great. This is the strongest thing about the movie. I also think that Chadwick does a phenomenal job with his acting, and you can feel his pain and anger, which is great. Now for the negatives. The movie is just boring. The pacing is odd, there's many scenes that I feel are just ridiculous, don't make sense, or just seem unnatural. Kilmonger's writing was awful, and made you feel barely any remorse for him, after going what he's been through. instead of seeming like an angry yet innocent person, looking to fix what he feels the wakandans (i dont know what you call them) caused, he comes off as just a forced, weak, and just bland villain. The movie seemed pretty robotic to me at points, which made it feel very unnatural, and ruined my enjoyment. It's just not that good. Lastly, the CGI in the movie was just outright garbage. I don't know what they did, but somehow between the trailers and the movie, the CGI looked worse. Adding that weird glowing purple armor made any fight scene involving T'Challa look like it was from an early 2010s video game. It looked so fake, and just so bad. Some other effects, mainly during the car scene were just bad. Considering the budget of the movie, compared to other movies like Doctor Strange and Thor Ragnarok, it just looks terrible, and unfinished. The movie is just overrated, bland, and way too long for its own good. There are way better marvel movies, and this is a movie going into the lower end of the marvel movie rankings.

","Dear readers, Black Panther is here to remove all your prejudices about Africa and racism that counters the Africans, eventhough the word ""black"" here is not representing African continent, but the power of hero, like a Panther, whose the color is black. So, the Black Panther movie is not just about a hero, but also politics among nations. The term hero is because the source of Black Panther energy is made only for heroes and the term of politic is main of whole story plot. It is about a new King replaces former King, but the former King had some mistakes on the past, so that the new King must remove and heal the wound of the nations, but in the same time, he must also take sacrifices to do the right thing for protecting Wakanda people. That's why the tagline ""Wakanda forever"" becomes viral and now everybody wants to do tourism in Africa because the landscape is so beautiful and the Director could mixed up the African continent with highly technology, as similar as other sci-fi movies. The plot also contents the girl power; because the highest military commander of Wakanda is a woman and all women had their essential parts for the development of the movie character. Some of wardrobe of women look like Xena the warrior princesses, that is compatible with wardrobe of the men that is more modern. The story is easygoing, not to hard, because the reverse memories are only in some scenes, so that the other scenes are just going forward.

Also strangely enough, the new movie encourages the same practises that the party did, namely community outreach and medical clinics. And just like the party, the movie makes it clear that politics is about power. Where the film differs from previous black superhero movies is that the hero here does not live with other Americans in a harmonious melting pot: they are their own kingdom, and vastly superior to the 'colonializers' (word used in the movie, FYI Imdb editors..). Well I guess in the end all superhero movies are empowering to their constituency (spiderman: the geeky teenagers; superman: the goody two shoes; the avengers: the groupies? Thor: the rednecks).

","""Black Panther"" is a 2018 comic book adaptation directed by Ryan Coogler starring Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan.
⚪
All in all, the most exotic entry into the gigantic Marvel Cinematic Universe exclaims a powerful battle cry that announces probably one of the most important films of the franchise of superhero films, as it finally establishes a hero that properly represents the black community and gives them someone who they can look up to, but regardless of the enormous social significance, it sadly suffers from a formulaic, predictable and mediocre story that doesn't add anything to the genre or is worth being called outstanding or innovative, and neither did it deserve any of its Academy Award nominations. After hearing about the devastating news about the passing of Chadwick Boseman, my best friend and I decided to honour the influential actor by watching the first solo adventure of the comic book character he made come to life. To me it was a first-time watch, and I only have heard about the usual things, such as the surprising Oscar nominations. As already mentioned above, I can see the importance of this film as form of social statement, but as a film itself, I wouldn't call it outstanding. It is the usual MCU quality, and that is not a terrible thing at all. It just isn't as outstanding as it is made out to be. One of the greatest factors is undoubtedly the film's stylish blend of the African wilderness and futuristic environment, as it just looks great and creates the atmosphere in the first place. Also, the idea of the different tribes in the same country was somewhat fascinating, but other than that it suffers from the typical comic book film flaws. In a story that shares a striking resemblance with the second outing of the ""Iron Man"" films, villain Erik Killmonger is both interesting yet predictable and his potential not fully realised. Aside from the fact that he was more right than wrong, he was too underused and wasted in terms of what he could have been. In the end, the film assembled a decent cast (of which no one really acts outstandingly, though) and became a production that is more eminent as a political statement, rather than as a cinematic achievement. The nominations for the technical categories might have been deserved (well, at least it wasn't nominated for the CGI, cause that was terrible PS2 game quality at its best), but the nomination for Best Picture is nothing short of an insult to comic book adaptations that haven't received this recognition but were tremendously better than this (""The Dark Knight"", ""Logan"", to name a few). I don't want to say that it was a terrible film at all, quite the contrary. It is the usual dose of Marvel fun. Black Panther has already become a necessary icon. I just don't think that it is the remarkable cinematic achievement it is treated as.

","Black Panther is one of the most over-hyped disappointing movies of the year so far. Just like The Last Jedi this move flops in many key departments making Disney's cash cow a boring uninteresting standard run of the mill Marvel movie. Before I dive in there is some good things about this movie like the villian. Michael B Jordan does a wonderful job making his character, Erik Killmonger, a sympathetic villain and easily the best part of the movie. Anyways my first problem with movie are how generic just because it is about an Africa does not make it deep. The main character is really just your standard superhero there is not much to him which weighs down the movie since we spend most of our with him. Most of the side character are not fleshed out at all and really do not feel anything for them when they are in danger. Another bad thing is the action scenes they just look to fake. Whenever an action scene happens Black Panther is Cgied and so are most of the backgrounds making them really dull and not entertaining. The only good part of the film the villain is given little screen time when he is easily the best part of the film.

Also, there is no way an isolated society with a tribal government could be advanced like this, even if they had access to the vibranium mineral which appears to be their primary advantage as a civilization.

The victim mentality is WAY too over the top.
This movie was beautifully done with great cinematography.
The story was...meh with predictable plot (tho Gorilla man proving to be a class act was a surprise and a real bonus) with lots of scenes that I saw as...why?
Acting was melodramatic and trite.
But what ruined it the most was the regular victim mentality theme that has just turned me off to most of Hollyweird and the media in general.
Up until now Marvel has taken the high road with this but they have dipped their toe into the politically correct cesspool that is losing Hollyweird millions of fans and dollars.

382,9 April 2019,hotrobinproductions,10," Best Marvel film to date (not just MCU but Marvel)
","I already know the hate this review will get. But it's true, this film transcends the marvel films into territory they haven't been able to even brush upon with their other films. From performances to script, to cinematography, this film has it all. I'm very concerned at the reviews on here where people are literally complaining about CGI. The landscape culture and the vibrant way it was shot was amazing. The CGI is solid, I don't get why people use it to bash films. If I were to watch a 1970s or older film I'm not going to bash it because the effects. I will judge the film off the film alone, how was the plot? How was the characters and acting? How was the cinematography? How was the script??? Like don't get me wrong. if it has impressive effects I will give them that and acknowledge it, especially for it's time, but I don't understand these people that complain about CGI and expect everything to be real. Let alone they expect every film to be some James Cameron focused CGI. Don't get me wrong, I love me some epic CGI especially when it pulls off so well, but I'm not going to judge the film so harshly on that alone and it's not fair that people do that. You should only do it if it's honestly distracting you from the plot or vibe in a moment of the film I guess, but even then I guess you can hate all the old films that came out back then because effects weren't the best JUST SAYING. Tired of these CGI fest people. ANYWAYS, this film delivers AND THEN SOME. It deserved to win best picture I have no idea why green room won over it but it did. This film achieved so much that it's a shame some audiences wouldn't know a good film if it was slapping them on the face. The performances from each character feels so rich and vibrant and everyone learns and changes to the end of the film. The VILLAIN is kick ass and by far the best villain in the MCU (over thanos as well) Michael B Jordan bounced back VERY hard after his failure in fan4stic. This film has the traditional superhero story but adds so much more with its own unique take. The director has such good talent using the amazing script. My only minor issue is the plot feels like 2 different films just minorly though. The Andy Serkis villain was great but his character kind of drifts away because something happens to him but then it shifts to a different film somewhat. It was a twist in a way but felt a bit fast and plot changing. Either way the characters still developed and didn't feel forced. The film is so beautifully shot from wakanda to the culture to the beautiful message of helping everyone around the world. The soundtrack is amazing and the music is SUCH heart wrenching and really captures you into the moment. There is some forced politics thrown in there here and there but it makes sense because it's an African country that has the utilities to help Africans when they were in slavery. Why wouldn't messages come up? I wouldn't say they were forced though it didn't feel forced for me. Captain Marvel forced their politics down our throats. From the feminist power, to ""illegal alien"" skrulls running from Donald trump... UGHH. But that's another story. I think black panther has it all AND more and for me personally it's definetly my top 10 favorite superhero movies of all time and definetly my #1 marvel film ever. Logan might be ahead MIGHT.

When an entitled young man with a troubled past has a different way he feels those virtues should be applied to the civilization's way of life, he decides to disrupt their equilibrium and take charge. Can the chosen king of the African civilization emerge and stop him? This movie is directed by Ryan Coogler (Creed) and stars Chadwick Boseman (42), Michael B.

How refreshing, then, to sit with my brown-skinned (foster) son and see a cast of people who represent him for a change, doing amazing things in Africa and doing so without white people rescuing them. How refreshing to see a vision of Africa without colonisation; how refreshing to see a hero character who learns something from the villain and where Africa has something to teach and give to the world. How refreshing for a South African audience to hear a South African language in a mainstream movie. How refreshing to hear the round of applause as the audience recognised their stories being told, the laughs of recognition. I don't think my foster son is aware enough of the context to appreciate the significance of this movie, but I was moved and thrilled. As a white Western male I've seen too much of an idealised vision of myself on the screen; I want my children to be able to see themselves in films like this, with inspiring women and the stories of black people being told in films that are both good and fun.

","I had never heard of the Marvel character Black Panther before the movie got released, so that made it even more of a surprise. What an experience. I don't think that I would go so far as to call the movie a masterpiece, but it's to see a superhero movie unlike the ones that we're used to seeing. Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker and Andy Serkis put on some impressive performances, and I especially enjoyed hearing all the different languages spoken.

","This has been touted as a fantastic film by numerous critics, but I found it to be a pretty average Marvel movie. That is not to say it is bad, because there are many things that it does right. The soundtrack is easily the most interesting of any film in the MCU, as it uses a combination of typical superhero/action movie score, African tribal music, and modern hip-hop that blends very well together. Also, the acting and characters are done very well, with three standout performances. Lupita N'yongo is great, Andy Serkis is exuberant, and Michael B. Jordan portrays one of the most interesting villains in the MCU. His character has a lot of depth and he provides a great foil with a potent motivation that is presented as pretty obvious social commentary. But even though it is on-the-nose, I did appreciate that the film actually attempted to get political. However, it is not without flaws. The first half drags a bit with a mix of dialogue-heavy scenes and generic action scenes. In fact, the action scenes throughout the film, save for the car chase and a fight between Kilmonger and Black Panther, are very bland. The filmmakers tried to recreate the same style of action that worked so well in The Winter Soldier, but they fell flat with some poor lighting, lack of grit, and CGI overload (particularly at the end). Overall, the movie is presented in a very generic way, with many of the same beats you would expect from every other superhero movie in the cinematography and editing.

The movie starts strongly with history of Wakanda and a captivating scene set in past. The world building of Wakanda is impressive in the beginning and it immediately generate interest in this fictional nation. Sad part is all your expectations turn to dissapointment when this movie becomes a generic affair with a very lazy story plot and predictable climax. Character of Shuri as Tachalla's brilliant sister is highlight of the film and rest of the cast is equally good. Movie has veen able to give depth to most of the characters and that is the strongest suits of the film. It is a shame that such characters are reduced to action figures rather than progressing the plot of the film. Film mention various issues faced by colored people which is the key motivation of villain Killmonger. When you expect a well thought off resolution of the central conflict of the film, all you get is punches, kicks and a lazy climax fight sequence. The most interesting premise or conflict raised in a MCU movie after winter soldier (privacy vs security) is resolved with 1 guy in suit fighting with another guy in suit in a cheap CGI battle (remember other numerous other MCU battles). I have no clue how can critics consider it an extremely good movie which will change landscape of superhero movies, it is strictly average at best.

","Though I would LOVE to get into the sociopolitical connotations of this obvious ""token"" effort towards its obviously token character I, unlike Marvel Studios, am aware of what is appropriate and what is not. Marvel comics have been force-feeding ridiculous ethnic transformations of age old, sacred iconic characters down their fans' throats in lieu of creating new ones and steadily losing their fanbase. With sociopolitically injected efforts like this and the casting of a dark girl as Valkyrie in Thor: Ragnarok, and the new interracial love interest in Spider-Man: Homecoming, it looks like Marvel Studios is determined to follow suit. Was this film meant to evolve the character, or simply to placate the misrepresented? Because this ""made for tv"" quality theatrical release seemed as much of a ""token"" to the Marvel lineup as the character Token is to South Park. Rather than fill a crucial vacancy in our culture this effort seems more like salt in a wound.

","Ahhh here we go again, another Marvel film. And I know I'm probably going to annoy a lot of people but, this is my review and if people disagree good for them. Disappointing, great potential and I really, really wanted to like it but... I didn't. One of the most loved characters in the marvel universe butchered. In the comics T'Challa is portrayed as an intelligent and most importantly a serious character; however, if I were to meet him in real life I wouldn't have a clue what he'd be like, unlike almost any other marvel character such as Iron man, Captain America and even Ant Man etc. The protagonists in the film are undeveloped and this is most obvious when you compare them to the villains that are shown to have a political standing and given such a rich personality over everybody else, when the audience can relate and connect to the villains more so than the protagonists the audience can't drive and support for the good guys; like most other superhero films. Don't get me wrong the villains are shown as such but the lack of character from the protagonists leaves a sour taste is one's mouth, especially since black panther is such a great character in the marvel franchise.

537,17 February 2018,anchoreddown,9," Marvel did it again!
","I had a small window of an opportunity to go see this movie opening day between things I had to do, and I'm glad I did. That's saying a lot from someone who's used to routines throughout the week.
They pack a lot into this chapter for the panther. I haven't taken the time to actually research the comic book character. Thankfully, there's plenty of exposition at the beginning, which is a good thing considering that there has been plenty of hype for each Marvel movie that comes out. It really helps the audience because this day in age, most people won't bother to do any research. For some movies, yes, you should get on Wikipedia or YouTube the character and see what pops up.
There's a lot that Black Panther is, and there's a lot that it isn't in the way of comic book adaptions. Marvel is getting better and better at keeping the superheroes fresh for the intended audience. The problem with DC is the way they've been handling their superheroes, but that's a whole different topic.
Yes, this is a bit of a political storyline, but at the same time the political side of the movie thankfully doesn't overpower the rest of it. There's plenty of action, ripped guys w their shirts off for the girls to leak their hormones all over, plenty of comedic moments and everything else in between. Martin Freeman's character is rather left hanging on as the comedic role, considering he's done this before w The Hobbit trilogy. 
As far as the culture of Wakanda, it's a mix between Iron Man's work and something you might see in Bruce Wayne's Bat-cave. Several parts made me think they could've used some of this technology in The Dark Knight trilogy. That is one impressive cave the panther has. The only thing that really stood out to me that was different was seeing that one guy who had that ornamental piece attached to his lip, ;-)
I've said it before, and I'll say it again, I've learned to stop reading reviews and what critics are saying about movies today because all they ever do anymore is shred the filmmakers to pieces. I want to be entertained, not to go into a theater to judge a movie. The rare exception would be sitting down to some Batman movie that would be similar to Batman & Robin. I'm a huge Bat-fan.

552,17 February 2018,neobateman,6," A combination of a political character study and a superhero extravaganza that doesn't always mix.
","Black Panther is the newest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Chadwick Boseman reprises his role from Captain America Civil War. The rest of the picture also features an great ensemble of well known actors. These include Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Forest Whitaker and Andy Serkis. All of whom give serviceable performances. After the events of Civil War, T'Challa (Boseman) returns to his home Wakanda, a land that is deeply hidden within the African forest. Wakanda has been hidden from the majority of the world for centuries, Challa has to make a choice when an unexpected enemy comes to take his place. Boseman plays Challa / Black Panther with a mixture of wisdom, patriotism but also a lack of experience when it comes to the world. This is a interesting combination that really pays off when T'Challa meets with the main villain of the film played by Michael B. Jordan. The idea of a advanced culture with innovative technology that remains hidden from the world is very interesting. The majority of people from Wakanda believe that this makes the world a better place. However when Killmonger shows up these ideas are challenged through his character. Killmonger is the best villain the MCU has had since Loki, this is because both T'Challa and Killmonger can learn a lot from each other. This aspect is easily the best thing about Black Panther, unfortunately the film only becomes compelling after we pass the first act. The first act consists of a generic superhero plot in which T'Challa and his team race after Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) in order to capture him. This is important for the story in the long run but left me very emotionally empty. It also gives very little attention to Killmonger who only becomes interesting after the first hour. There is plenty of humour in Black Panther, the best jokes in the film came from Shuri (Letitia Wright) who plays the sister of T'Challa. She added plenty of self awareness that made myself and the all of the audience roar in the theatres. Unfortunately Black Panther also suffers from the same issues that Guardians of the Galaxy vol 2 and Thor Ragnarok suffered from and that is the fact that jokes are implemented in the wrong scenes. Sometimes a scene is meant to be serious until a character cracks a joke killing the impact of the scene. The action scenes also let me down, most of the them were too cgi heavy and I would've prefered some more realistic stunt work (but that's personal taste), especially because the director's previous film Creed had one of the sleekest looking fight scenes of recent years. Many of the special effects in Wakanda also felt unfinished, the look itself were breathtaking. However there were many set pieces that felt incomplete and too cartoony. The costumes and music of the film is terrific though, they really give this exotic african feel, it makes the film a lot more authentic. After the first hour passed, I really enjoyed this picture. There were some minor gripes with special effects and tone, but for the most part I had a lot of fun with it.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","This is a good spin on a predictable genre. Other reviewers say that it's the same kind of superficiality masked by a black cast, but I disagree. I think this deals with a more complex subject like Pan-Africanism in an interesting setting. The soundtrack and costumes were both very enriching. Klaue seems to be a key villain early on, but this quickly shifts as Killmonger becomes the main threat. This complicates the surface level conflict of Wakanda vs. the outer world, as Killmonger has Wakandan roots. Anyone claiming that Killmonger was superficial is clearly biased, considering he's up against incredibly bland characters in other Marvel films like Thanos, Ultron, and Loki.

587,26 April 2019,lumieretrain,8," Black Panther by Ryan Coogler
","The stories about superheroes who take part of a royal family are interesting, to see how the main characters would balance their responsibilities, between being a superhero around the world and being a king in the kingdom where they are from. The main characters would take important decisions for the good of the kingdom and its people, by making sure to not commit the same mistakes of the past that brought heavy consequences. Some of these stories would end with the sacrifice of the main characters, who leave to the people an important message to move forward with the kingdom. Other stories would end with the main characters surviving from a dangerous mission, who will then conclude with what they started. There was an interest to release in the MCU a solo movie about the character Black Panther, to see how he would move forward after the event of Captain America: Civil War. Until the young filmmaker Ryan Coogler came to release the movie about Black Panther, as he decided to make the movie differently than the previous MCU movies. In 2018 came out Black Panther by Ryan Coogler with Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, Martin Freeman, Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker and Andy Serkis. The movie's plot: The new king T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) returns to Wakanda, to assume the throne after the death of his father. In this hidden kingdom filled with incredible technologies, Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) comes to Wakanda with a reason to challenge T'Challa. There was a great risk to make Black Panther, as usually innovative movies became box office failure to be then appreciated years later as important cult. Instead Black Panther surprised the audience and the critics, to become a successful movie with more than $1.347 billion box office. Usually the superhero movies explore in the easiest way the theme good and evil, which is going to be already expected how the story would end. Instead Black Panther explored the theme good and evil in the complex way, to see how some decisions bring heavy consequences which makes the movie intriguing and original. The screenplay was elaborated to be clear how the story would be told, from the beginning to the end, without ruining the narration's rhythm of the story. The movie does not use any kind of clichés to be predictable, but it surprises with unexpected plot twists to be unpredictable. The production designer Hannah Beachler elaborated the settings of Wakanda in a particular way, as she took inspirations from the original Black Panther comic book's settings and also from some of Africa's settings to make the movie creative and visceral for the audience. The lightings, the colors and the camera make some of the most emotional scenes, atmospheric where the audience would get surprised. Some of the most spectacular moments of the movie look like atmospheric paintings, which make these epic scenes unforgettable and emotional in every shot angles. The costume designer Ruth E. Carter elaborated the costumes in a particular way, which make these costumes stylish also thanks to the colors and their forms. It is also interesting to see how some of the tribal costumes, are technologically advanced which make them creative. The score by Ludwig Göransson was creatively elaborated, as it uses orchestral instruments mixed with traditional African instruments. The musician Baaba Maal collaborated with Ludwig Göransson to make the score powerful, especially on the unforgettable tracks which he sang for the most epic scenes. Chadwick Boseman did an excellent performance as T'Challa who has to take an important decision, if Wakanda has to be kept as a secret kingdom or if it has to be revealed. It is an interesting part of the movie, to see what kind of difficult responsibility T'Challa has to take for Wakanda. Michael B. Jordan was really good as Erik Killmonger, who is one of the best villains of MCU. He is a character who has so much anger inside of his soul by searching the justice, in the most violent way for vengeance which can be understood the reason of his anger. Lupita Nyong'o did a well done performance as Nakia who is a strong character, she would do anything to help T'Challa whenever he needs. Danai Gurira did a well done performance as Okoye who is a proud Wakandan and T'Challa's bodyguard, she remains loyal to the Royal's throne no matter if some kings are good men or not. Finally Letitia Wright was excellent as Shuri who is T'Challa's younger sister, she creates incredible technologies to be even smarter than Tony Stark. The special effects were specifically elaborated by making the action scenes, spectacular and visceral in every single details to be breathtaking. Black Panther is one of the best and most creative superhero movies of all time.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018
588,19 February 2018,mr_bickle_the_pickle,7," Black Panther sinks his claws into the MCU
","It definitely is wonderful to see a big blockbuster film like this have a majority black led cast and not have the focus be on their oppression. Not that stories of slavery, racism & police brutality aren't important, but I think its important for little black kids to see themselves as Kings or Queens too, who also are self sufficient. So I hope this movie does trigger Hollywood to do more movies in a similar vein. Now with that aside, how does fall within the MCU for me? Overall, I enjoyed it. Though to be fair, there hasn't been a movie yet that I have really hated, a few that Ive been a bit disappointed by thats it. Im still re-evaluating my current standings (so this may change), but I think this is likely around the 5th best movie for me. There is a lot of stuff that is great. In particular I really liked Letitia Wright as Shuri. There's just such a brightness to her. She's incredibly delightful, smart, funny and gets to kick some ass too. Killmonger is a great villain. Hes not just lame villain the hero fights in the 3rd act and is defeated after 10 minutes. He has a presence throughout. He's also such a genuinely dark character who will literally kill whoever's in his path with little to no remorse. He'll blind side and double cross you if he gets the chance. I also thought Klaue was a lot of fun. Yes, he's a bad guy, but he's just crazy, chaotic kind of kooky and Andy Serkis breathes some life into him. There are also some gorgeous costumes and sets. A couple of funny lines here and there (my favourite was the vegetarian line) but it definitely doesnt focus on that too much. There were things I disliked or am nit-picky about. I eye-rolled so hard at the ""What are those"" line. Its a dated vine/meme/whatever. It was never that funny to begin with and feels like a cheap gag to get some kids in the theater to laugh. I didn't buy into Daniel Kaluuya's character motivations. There is that line about how Klaue killed his parents, so I understand he wants them dead, but it just doesnt seem believable how easily he turned on T'Challa. Also in accordance with his character, him and Danai Gurira are supposed to be in a relationship and yet we barely get any interaction between the two. I think the height of their interaction is calling each other ""My Love"". I assume they added it in because they wanted to add some stakes when his character supports Killmonger, but I didnt think it added anything. Im not saying we had to devote a 30 minute subplot to their romance, but a few more moments here and there may have helped to solidify them as a couple and make you care a little bit more later on in the film when you see them on opposite sides of the battlefield. Also, I dont understand how Angela Bassets hair SUDDENLY turns white. So yeah, a couple of grievances that stopped me from fully enjoying my experience, but overall a lot of stuff to like as well. I think if you're a fan of the MCU you'll like this one too.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","This movie was in no way the worst of all the Marvel films, but it does lack originality. I'm hearing many people say that this film is unique and separates itself from the rest of the marvel installments. I really don't know what they're on about. The plot is really generic. In a way it's as if we've all seen this film before, just rehashed with better, (well, ""better"" CGI). A man comes and visits his home to take the throne over his father's kingdom. Once he becomes king, another fellow family member decides to dethrone him (for his own reasons). The villain humiliates the protagonist, conquers the land for some time, and then the hero returns to kill him off. T'challa himself wasn't a very lovable character, I found him to be very bland and lacking of expressions. Kill monger is probably the reason this movie wasn't a complete catastrophe, although there wasn't anything particularly outstanding about him, he was quite charismatic and enjoyable to watch. I really couldn't care less about him dying in the end, seeing as if he was gone missing for like 50 minutes of the movie. Not only that, but let's be honest everyone saw it coming. This film was predictable from start to finish, maybe that's why I didn't enjoy it too much. The jokes were cheesy, maybe one or two landed. My final complaint was the pacing of the film. It all started really fast and then about 20 minutes in to halfway through the film, the movie was really slow.

","After a folktale-like prologue that recounts the history of the fictional African nation of Wakanda, BLACK PANTHER opens with a flashback to 1992, when a younger T'Chaka (Atandwa Kani) makes a surprise visit to Oakland, California, to confront a rogue Wakandan spy. Back in the present, T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) is preparing for his coronation day, which includes a potential challenge -- through ritual combat -- from any of Wakanda's five tribes, as well as a sacred ceremony in which he officially becomes the nation's Black Panther. After T'Challa takes the throne, intelligence surfaces that notorious arms dealer Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) has stolen a vibranium artifact from the British Museum. T'Challa takes his top warrior -- head of the royal guard General Okoye (Danai Gurira) -- and his former love, Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), a Wakandan spy, to attempt to capture Klaue (one of the few outsiders who knows the truth about how much vibranium -- the most valuable metal on Earth -- is available in Wakanda). But CIA operative Everett Ross (Martin Freeman) and Klaue's mysterious young ally (Michael B. Jordan) complicate the mission. It turns out that the mystery man is a former SEAL who has a very personal score to settle with T'Challa and the Wakandans.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

652,26 March 2018,ironhorse_iv,7," Black Panther roars into theaters. Was it good? It was alright.
","Follows the events of 2016's 'Captain America: Civil War'. T'Challa Udaku (Chadwick Boseman) returns home to the isolated, technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda to take his place as king, only to find, that an old enemy, Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens AKA N'Jadaka (Michael B. Jordan) has reappears to challenge him for the throne. Without spoiling too much of the film, from all 'Cinematic Universe' movies from the Walt Disney Company & Marvel Studios so far, there is perhaps, none that is more celebrated from fanboys & movie critics, right now, than director, Ryan Coolger's superhero film, ""Black Panther"". The film received praise for nearly everything. It even become one of the highest-grossing films of all time. A global phenomenon. However, it does beg the question, is all that praise, truly justified? The answer is somewhat yes. 'Black Panther' was indeed an entertaining movie. However, it's not a complete perfect masterpiece of art. Some of the praise from critics and fans is a bit overblown to the point, that it sounds like pompous. They're overlooking some of the film's biggest flaws. Examples include the fishing plot-hole, pacing issues, the story being too similar to 1994's animation movie, 'the Lion King', the heavy use of fake-looking CGI during the cliché looking chase sequences, the uneven & unrealistic portrayal of modern day economics in isolated sovereign state, and last, by not least, the lack of vulnerability & suspense when it comes to Black Panther's overpowered suit and abilities. All of these are worth criticize about. After all, all these issues came across, as very jarring on screen. It kinda took some audience members, out of the film. Although, it wasn't as distracting, as the obvious disconnected this movie had, over previous Marvel's films when it comes to the portrayal of Wakanda's intentional isolationism beliefs. Instead of having the nation be a little more open into intermingling with other countries; as seen in 'Captain America: Civil War'; where Wakanda had establish foreign aid with certain African nations like Lagos. The movie chose to backtrack, and make this African nation's people seem more traditional close-off; despite the fact, in the previous film, they were a powerful influencer in United Nation, when it comes to reviewing the Sokovia Accord. That was a big risky big retcon that sadly, didn't pay off. After all, Coogler and his writers kept the very public death scene for king, T'Chaka (John Kani) from the previous movie, even though, he supposed to be, a hermit. It doesn't add up. It lesser Killmonger's argument, big time. All this 'blind eye to foreign affairs' retcon muddled things up. It doesn't make much sense. Not only that; but it also made the world building seems a little more jarring. After all, how does the technologically advanced nation, stay so hidden for so long, during the Modern Digital Age? Do their citizens live within the country's border under a heavy watch by their government, unable to leave or bring anybody in? Seeing that Wakanda has assassins and spies, everywhere. I'm starting to doubt, that this nation is truly worth rooting for. After all, these are the same smart people that blindly follow their new leader into battle, without questioning anything about their way of leadership. The place sounds like a cult in the verge of turning into another Imperial Japan. After all, they worship a living embodiment of their panther god. Wakanda might be a highly control, centralized, cult of personality feudalism-like state. After all, there seem to be, some type of social caste system in Wakanda that borderline, doesn't seem right. If anything, side-villain, M'Baku (Winston Duke) seem more of the good guy than anybody in the film. He's the only one, truly using his brain, by questioning establishment and exploring his surroundings. Still, you would think, he would had expose the royal family's lies on the internet by now. After all, this tribe seem to know, a lot about some western culture. So, they has to be some sort access to the outside world to get that type of an information; even if it's hard to find a WIFI connect in the mountain. Regardless of that, another problem with the over-fawning by fans & critics, is how incorrect, some of them are with their praising. A good example is how some people treat this, as the first black superhero movie. They act like it's a milestone in cinema; which it is not. If you notice on IMDB, they has been black superheroes movies, way before this, like 1993's 'Meteor Man', 1997's 'Spawn' & 2008's 'Hancock' to name a few. It's nothing new. If anything 1998's 'Blade' deserve most of the credit. That's the true,' first Marvel black superhero movie ever'. Despite all that, there's are some truly some good examples to appreciate in 'Black Panther'; such as the Afro Punk design, the soundtrack, and the use of real foreign languages like Xhosa. Nevertheless, it's the unique characters that truly stand out. Even if, Chadwick Boseman's African accent sound cheesy. All the acting from the performers were great. Overall: While, 'Black Panther' might not be Wakanda Forever for me, due to plot-holes in the story. At least, it's not kitty litter. It's still a decent movie, worth checking out.

A society that from what we know is prospering and loves their king.Now you would expect people to go against it but in black panther theyre like 'fine lets change everything we know for a guy that we have never seen before and go into war something that we have never done before'. same thing happened in ragnarok but there people were rightfully not ok with it. 
-Even when the coup is ongoing for no apparent reason it also stops for no apparent reason. The right hand of warmonger somewhere remembers that his wife is fighting for the opposing side and like that calls the coup off.
-most technologically advanced society having survived some thousand of years and they crown the guy that can win in a brawl. makes sense...

The beginning glossed over the origins way too quickly to understand and some of the mysticism around vibranium could have been better explained. Some of their actions didnt make much sense and the screenplay and special effects were a little lacking. I also thought that, for a marvel action movie, their could have been more ACTION. Go see it if you want a forgettable marvel action flick. SJWs wanted a black superhero (hes not the first one though, not even close) and they got it but just like star wars it is terrible.

","Black Panther is directed by Ryan Coogler and stars a phenomonel cast that includes Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyongo, Forest Whitaker, Andy Serkis and the list goes on. 
Set after the events of Captain America: Civil War, Prince T'Challa is about to be crowned king of Wakanda, but when a long buried secret is uncovered it threatens the country of Wakanda and the rest of the World! 
I really liked this film! And for a number of reasons. First of all this is a very well directed film made by the very talented director Ryan Coogler. The entire film feels original new and exciting thanks to his vision!
Whats also great about this is Wakanda it self. This beautiful land is so well realised on the screen. It serves as one of the most interesting locations in the MCU. 
What set Black Panther aside from the other Marvel films is it's great story that suprisingly tackles a lot of deep themes. 
All the actors are great in it, espescially Michal B. Jordan as the villain Killmongor. Killmongor is by far one of the best and most compelling MCU villains so far. His backstory and viewpoints are explored and you really get where he is comming from. However there was not quite enough of him. But whenever he is onscreen you are on the edge of your seat!
All these factors makes the film much more than just your average Marvel movie. It makes it into a film with a strong message and compelling characters. 
Black Panther is absolutely one of the best Marvel movies and highly recomended!

","""Black Panther Down"" is the movie directed by Ridley Scott and starring Orlando Bloom for 2 seconds. Alright, I'm just joking. It's been a long day, but I got the chance to check out the new Marvel movie, which I had no real expectations for. The marketing didn't get me hooked and it all sort of felt underwhelming to me. But I wanted to see it since I liked the Black Panther a lot in ''Civil War'' with his ""I don't care"" attitude. The character did grow with his own little story arc, so when you see him now, he's become a more responsable man. The movie was fine in my eyes. It's your usual Marvel picture when it comes to story and visuals, but at least it's an entertaining flick with enough craziness to keep you locked in for two hours. That's something I feel that the guys at Marvel aren't afraid of anymore; to go all out with the comic book weirdness and sometimes campyness. Now they wanna embrace it. Which has been strongly evident in the last ""Thor"" movie. That's not to say that there isn't any grittiness, because there is. It's all combined into one here.

The critics gave this movie incredible reviews because of what not only was done cinematically but culturally as well. The acting is special and I believed to be heart felt. Considering this is a first of its kind I was pleased that it didn't feel like it would be the last of its kind. The music speaks to you and gives you a great feeling of pride. No matter where you come from. I battled with the decisions the characters were making and the challenges they were faced which is a great thing because the movie made you think on several different levels. I read someones review and he/she stated the story was ripped from The Lion King but yet they rated it a one. If that's the case are you mad because you felt it wasn't original or did you dislike The Lion King too(another movie involving African culture). Lol what a misguided childhood if you didn't like the The Lion King.
Is there a large use of CGI yes but name a movie even without action that doesn't. Marvel/Disney are giving us awesome affects. Appreciate it! This is a superhero movie! I completely wish people that are bias would stop seeing these movies eyes wide shut and live a little. Watch this movie think outside the box. It's now one of my favorites from the Marvrel Universe and they are not at all giving us bad movies especially not ones that you could possibly put the rating of a 1 or under a 6 for that matter. Ones,twos and threes are for B movies with terrible visual effects and absolutely no plot. Know the rating system so you don't give people the wrong ideas!

This is based on a comic book hero that has been around since 1966, when he made his first appearance in a Fantastic Four comic. FYI: His debut was about 2 months before the militant Black Panther Party made their debut, so there was no connection between the two. Chadwick plays T'Challa, the son of the King of Wakanda, an East African country that is more than it appears to be. They have a precious metal called Vibranium that powers their whole country. They use it for all sorts of technological wonders; weapons, transportation, medicinal, etc. Vibranium can absorb and then refocus energy and it was even used in making Captain Americas' shield. When his father dies-as seen in Captain America:Civil War, Chadwick's first cinematic appearance-Chadwick returns to become King, and the new Black Panther, as was his father before him. That's when multiple problems start hitting the fan. First, Andy steals some Vibranium and Chadwick has to try and stop him-the policy of Wakanda is to keep their high technology a big secret from the outside world, so as to prevent misuse of the metal. Then Michael shows up, claiming to be the rightful heir to the Wakandian throne and challenges Chadwick to a fight. Lupita plays Chadwick's love interest and Danai is the head of security for Chadwick. Stan Lee pops up in his customary cameo-look for him in the casino scene-and there are 2 scenes at the end. The first is right after the end credits start and the second one is at the very end, so make sure you stay until the very end-it has a familiar character show up.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for action, violence and a rude gesture and it has a running time of 2 hours & 14 minutes.

","I'm still puzzled at the amazing Box Office success of ""Black Panther"". I was looking forward to watching this movie as soon as it came out on Blu-ray. Finally, last weekend me and my family watched it. The veredict? Very nice eye candy but I never felt ANYTHING for ANY of the characters on the screen. The only one who had some sort of ""life"" was Andy Serkis character, but he was gone way too early. The plot is contrived at best, something 13 year old kids will definitely have trouble with. It was nice seeing Danai Gurira (The Walking Dead) in a prominent role, although she basically apes what she does in TWD.
Halfway through the movie I fell asleep, literally, just waking up some 20 odd minutes before the end.
Either I'm becoming too old (which is a fact) or movies of this nature are becoming a bore. I'd like to thing it's the second, cause I enjoy mostly sci-fi/fantasy/horror fare over any other genre. Plus, I still enjoy kids movies like ""Coco"" or ""Ferdinand"" very much. I think there's been an over saturation of things Marvel in recent years, even more so than Star Wars stuff. To top it all, comic wise, I don't recall ever hearing of a hero named ""Black Panther"", unlike Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk or Spider-man.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

This second prologue sets the stage for the ultimate T'Challa/Killmonger conflict that plays out later in the movie, but I'll admit it takes a while to get there.

Daniel Kaluuya who I remember from Skins and Black Mirror (where he was literally the definition amazing), only for Get Out to come and blow our minds entirely.

Basically, the movie is about inter-turmoil between Wakanda tribes on the subject of releasing their tech to the rest of the world. Some are against the idea as it will expose Wakanda to the world and some are all for it thinking it's for the greater good. The bad guy is pretty human by Marvel standards. In the end, he just wants to go home, gather his people and help save all the other oppressed people of the world. There is action but not as much as some people seem to like. There is no major alien/godly badguy to defeat. They are really just fighting themselves. The cast is colorful and you are not bombarded with stale jokes every frame (unlike Thor Ragnarok). I give this movie a solid 8 out of 10 stars.

With its impressive grand scale and lavish sets and costumes it opens up a new world and culture never seen before in the MCU till now.

We watch as newly crowned King T'Challa puts his Royal skills to the test protecting his country while also updating the old standards his father left behind. While he may not have the most thrilling journey compared to other heroes we've seen T'Challa makes for a likable good-hearted Warrior thanks to Chadwick Boseman's affectionate charm. Michael B Jordan is no doubt the standout as the rageful Eric Killmonger. An intimidating antagonist each time he walks in a room, you despise his doings but also sympathize with where he's coming from as a lost mercenary looking to gain power for not him but for the people he knows that need it.

","The enormity of the pressure that has manifested over time for this film has been nothing short of extraordinary. Not just for Marvel Studios as they continue their effortless cinematic universe, but for the multicultural film industry. The biggest blockbuster featuring a predominantly black cast, I have to applaud every single contribution made...they never succumbed to the pressure and have produced one of Marvel's stronger chapters. T'Challa returns to Wakanda after the events of 'Civil War' and must prove to be a worthy successor to the throne. Meanwhile, the precious resources secluded in this region are slowly becoming noticed by other nations, to which a worthy adversary soon arrives to challenge T'Challa. We are presented with an ever present scale. Either securing an extremely powerful material for the benefit of one nation or distributing it to other countries to establish a sense of hierarchy. This subtle political message adds that additional layer of depth amidst the hectic action. Boasted by energetic engrossing performances from all cast members, and we have ourselves a successful blockbuster. The story surprisingly was thick with plenty of world building, memorable characters and a few shifts in motives that provide some complexity to the narrative. A barrage of humour, some jokes land and several lines do not...I'm looking at you whoever included ""What are those!?"". The fight choreography was well executed, particularly during the ritual challenges. The visual effects were put to good use, Wakanda's architecture and technology was creatively inventive. The human CGI still remains mediocre, and is ridiculously noticeable during the final battle. The soundtrack masterfully blends African drums with American beats, highlighting modern and cultural significance. Oh, and finally a villain that just doesn't want to destroy the world.

","I just want to mention that the message of Martin Luther King Jr. won out Malcolm X when they finally met and discussed opposing viewpoints, Malcolm would later change his way of thought and acknowledge that Dr.King was right. After all the message of Dr. King was one grounded in the truth of Jesus Christ and which borrowed from Ghandi's own movement against similar opposition from the English and yielded success, that coupled with the support of JFK who likewise borrowed from Abraham Lincoln and we have a model that cannot be denied. Therefore let us all pray as Dr. King prayed for peace, forgiveness, harmony, oneness, understanding and respect for everyone and everything which is a center piece of the beleifs of Ghandi but which all Christians must likewise support. This movie inadvertently appears at a time when the movie makers decided that enough controversy exist (Captain America's Civil War and last years sad and disturbing KKK riots in Charlottesville, we are not in the 60's anymore! ) in the world that it would generate enough interest and thereby sales to garner success for its efforts. While the marketing strategy succeeded, the moral implications should not be ignored specifically as mentioned above regarding all efforts toward harmony and peace in all areas concerning the social attitudes, beleifs and values of all the peoples living in this great country. It with great hope that the writers show every bit of responsibility in the upcoming films to remember that this is the true direction of a hero such as the one played by Chadwick, is for peace, forgiveness. Letting go of the past and embracing the future as harmonious beings seeking to heal and help each other as we work towards a brighter future must be the aim of our leaders that must be seasoned in the lessons of our past and dutifulminded to steer clear of repeating them, forgiving the wrongs and adhering to the right in our evolution to continue to raise the bar for the human condition. 
 On a side note please make sure that the comic code authority (a guideline to ensure that children would be protected from harmful messages or stories) is restored to comics, there are many comic books that have many harmful messages in them, parents take note that Marvel and DC comics got rid of the comic code Authority when they went corporate in an effort to make more money. Comics were always for children and still are, why are we not more concerned about the safety of their highly impressionable minds, please contact both Marvel and DC comics to pressure them about this issue for it will not go away. 
One last note regarding DC and the new Black Lightning t.v. show, the actor is great but the costume is really lame, he should have a black costume with small yellow lighning bolts near the neck or the left breast and a simple black mask that covers most of his face. The costume could be bullet proof but not mechanical, he is not Iron Man and he can fly via the lightning powers, finally he should make his debut in the Justice League Movie. One more point the actor who plays Martian Manhunter (also an African American actor) is really great in the role as the Martian, except his powers due to a low budget on the Supergirl series expires quickly, can you give him his full powers and have him also in the Justice League movie, he has always been a major character in the series.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

Like Wonder Woman (which was also a 4/5 star film for me), they don't get the absurd statement.

Even with the film's generally high rating, a lot of the individual reviews bash this film for whatever reason, whether it's the story line, the CGI, the acting, take your pick. For me, it was a super-hero action flick that served well in that capacity, even if some of the elements are derivative of other sources. Certainly the costuming and cinematography is expertly done, and the character motivations are developed well enough to distinguish the good guys from the bad guys. If there's a bone to pick it's with the screenwriters, I would have preferred less of the modern day tendency toward globalization that the picture fosters. Though the villain Erik Stevens/Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) made a compelling case for T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) and the rest of Wakanda to share their wealth, knowledge and resources with the rest of the world, I didn't see it as their obligation to do so. But the irony is, after all the fighting, death and destruction, T'Challa eventually wound up coming around to that side of the argument, which made Killmonger a martyr for no cause.

","The hype around this film during its initial release was overwhelming, I may not agree with it but it's understandable as Black Panther is the first film in MCU to feature a predominantly black cast. Which is something that's rare and has been underrepresented in the MCU, and cinema in general. I thought the writing and directing were all very good. And also the film is technically an excellent movie. Visually Black Panther is stunning. The cinematography (especially in Wakanda) is incredible. The visual effects used during the fights/action set pieces are excellent ( tho the CGI is dodgy in most parts). I also like the costumes, in particular those of the various Wakandan tribes. The make-up effects also deserve some praise. The soundtrack is very impressive; the rhythm of the drums give that authentic African feel; and the modern music is integrated perfectly to intensify the action. In terms of performances; Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa does a pretty good job. As the new King, he has so much going on around him; Not only must he deal with the external matter of preventing someone from using vibranium as a destructive weapon but he must also face internal challenges for his crown. T'Challa could have sat back and enjoyed his position, maintaining the status quo. Instead however, he felt it a duty to consider what he believed to be the failings of past Wakandan monarchs and do what he believed was right for this generation.
Michael B Jordan as the villain Erik Killmonger is also amazing. The character's motivations, albeit villainous could in a way almost be justified. This is what made him such an interesting character. The rest of the supporting casts are good in their performances.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","Black Panther is a solid, good movie. Nothing less, nothing more. I wasn't as impressed by it as with some other MCU movies, and there were definietly a few flaws, mainly in the action and CGI department. That being said, the positives in this movie most definietly outweigh the negatives. The plot is engaging and showcases the fictional culture of Wakanda nicely. I liked how different it felt than other movies in the MCU, and how it was more about internal political struggles rather than The End of the Entire World as we Know it. The characters are great as well, T'Challa and Erik were both nicely fleshed out, and the side characters were mostly good as well. The chemistry between them all is very delightful. The pacing is solid as well, and so are the emotional moments. I have a few problems with the movie though. The cgi is way too overused at some points, especially the final fight scene. The action itself also feels a bit stiff, the fighting feels a little too slow and unimpactful. The movie also tries to be funny at some points, which more often than not feels extremely tedious. Still though, those flaws aren't enough to make the movie bad, not in the slightest. It's a well told, well written, pretty powerful story that ties nicely into the MCU storyline, and I have no regrets about watching it.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

The character development was wonderful. Speaking of characters, I am so appreciative of the fact that the women in this movie were fully recognized humans!

","I have never not liked a superhero movie that came from Marvel or DC Comics, until Black Panther! IMBD gave it a 7.8/10, Rotten Tomatoes a 97%, and Metacritic an 88%! Their showing must've had all the fabulous scenes and storyline that was obviously edited out. I appreciate and enjoy the 3 act structure of the set-up, confrontation, and resolution that the screenwriters and directors use to seamlessly keep these movies action packed, exciting, humorous, emotionally gripping, and thought provoking. None of this was done effectively with Black Panther. I hate to say this but it seemed as if the director, Ryan Coogler was trying to make this movie relative to the struggles of black communities living together in inner-cities. I could be totally in left field with that thought but it just seemed too coincidental. Albeit fine, and if that was his objective, superhero films that are based on the action, adventure, and sci-fi genre don't flow seamlessly, or well, with a film that seems steeped in the drama genre. It was a disappointingly abysmal let down. How this movie got rave reviews by movie critics across the board is mind boggling but in this day and age when you can lose your job, followers, advertising deals by being forthright, unflattering, and God forbid curt and negatively critiquing a film that is made up of 98% African American Actors, Director, and Writers you will unequivocally get torn apart by the news media, social media, and probably ANTIFA!

1013,19 February 2018,saketkt,7," Epic Buildup to the Infinity Stone movie
","Marvel took a huge risk with black panther just before the release of The Infinity Wars. With a complete different tone as compared to other
marvel movies, the risk may not have paid off and it could have affected the frenzy around the final two movies with box office not performing
as expected. But, the movie turned out to be brilliant and Marvel continues to outperform DC on all levels (JL was a disappointment).
I think Marvel's formula for success is to have atleast a decent story line, like the trunk of a tree, rather than going all bang bang with
expensive grpahics. Then characters are introduced and developed just like branches of a tree over time. There are as many as nine diverse characters and
all of them are given sufficient screen time. The setting is similar to background where the tree (analogy) is growing. The set here is Wakanda.
The designers have done a marvellous job with the city, costume, and make up. The soundtracks bring an element of Africa beautifully binding Wakanda
and the characters. The dialogues are decent with tinge of humour and smartass lines.
Black panther (without revealing any spoilers) is a story of a prince who rights the wrong of his father in light of his death. TChaka created
the monster killmonger due to differences in ideology with his cousin. Klaue is another interesting character who smuggles vibranium out of Wakanda
and is responsible for death of Tchaka and other tribe leaders. TChalla is looking to avenge his father's death when he encounters Killmonger and loses
control over Wakanda in a straight duel to the throne with him. With help from Jabari tribe, Nakia, and Shuri; TChalla manages to defeat Killmonger and
brings about few changes for the first time as a ruler of Wakanda.
Now, coming to the ratings of the movie, there are five parameters on which I score movie out of ten. These are story (1), acting (1.5), aesthetics (2),
editing/narrating (1.5), Xfactor/uniqueness/fun (1.3) which totals to 7.3/10. My reccommendation is MUST WATCH.
I like to end my reviews by describing my favourite scene of the movie. Mine is- the car chase scene in which Klaue tries to escape and TChalla

I liked just like Spider-Man: Homecoming, they were able to tie this in with Captain America: Civil War.

I don't know why Marvel Studios doesn't invite him to do more for them. This movie also won best achievement in production design. I 100% agree. They way they made Wakanda look was phenomenal, and the sets they used for scenes like the Ancestral Plane, the Garden of the Heart Shaped Herb, the ritual combat arena, and M'Baku's throne were breathtaking. Shuri's lab was also pretty cool. Lastly this movie won an Oscar for best achievement in costume design.

","With the glut of superhero movies being released in theatres, one of the things that I credited movies like Deadpool and Logan for was trying to tell a more personable story. It doesn't have to be about saving the world, just introduce some characters we can enjoy following and provide some motivation we can relate to. Black Panther centres around the rivalry/conflict between T'Challa and Killmonger and I think that's an interesting choice. Killmonger is a shadowy version of what T'Challa could have been and the movie brings you along with their new king's struggle to understand his father's and his uncle's actions. But the important thing about this is you understand the differing perspectives of the characters and while you're cheering for T'Challa, you can at least understand where Killmonger is coming from. Their situation doesn't come with an easy answer and this problem compounds T'Challa's other issues (dealing with the death of his father, the responsibilities of running Wakanda, Nakia not reciprocating his affection for her etc.).

","I was slightly let down by thia movie, my expectations weren't very high but I still expected more than this. I'm gonna start off on a high note with the positives. First of all this movie is largely very well paced, you can easily define each act of the movie which aided in storytelling. The characters were all quite enjoyable and fit there roles especially the titular character, Chadwick Boseman felt so natural and comefortable in T'Challa. Fun additions to the cast were Andy Serkis and Letita Wright. The film was shot very well, I enjoyed the cinematography and it featured more vibrant colours than I would've expected. Unfortunately where this movie loses it's steam is in the script, it consistentaly put the characters into positions which lead to a predictable story, there were so many things that I knew were gonna happen before they did, not too many twists and turns to keep things interesting. Another thing that bothered me was the unrealistic technology, it consumed most of the action sequences with, ""hey look at this cool thing"", tech played an important part in the script but the unbelievability of it just took me right out of the story. The dialogue was also very campy from time to time and not in a self aware kind of way. The character motivations don't always make sense, I felt the conflict wasn't properly resolved by the end. And the action scenes took a dive into ""lazy cgi punchfests"" so to speak, I thought we were over that, especially after the scathing reviews this film recieved. I'm honestly shook this film has such a high metascore, I really don't believe it's that good.

Second Film of Choice at tHe Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Black Panther. Time for another Marvel production. This was not your usual Marvel film. However it was fabulous. What made this one different is we were not bombarded with lots of superhero stuff this was more a tale of sci-fi folklore which erupted from a hidden city in the depths of Africa onto the rest of the world. This was a tale of who wins the throne and who is worthy to carry on the name and the work of Black Panther. There was much solemnity in this film interspersed with irreverence at solemn moments which elicited burst of laughter from the audience. Although slow it parts I felt this was necessary to the storyline and kudos must be given to the model makers and animators for creating a city fitting of both a metropolitan situation and an African savannah. Great use of rhinos, and some rather fancy intense battle scenes. I like the panther suit and the technology which comes with it. It was a little like watching Q from James Bond with all his gadgets, only way cooler. Although very different from the usual Marvel film I do feel this slots neatly into its place in the franchise.

","And that's even before more superhero movies are coming out later, including the big one, Avengers Infinity War. My dad is kinda sick of superhero movies save for a few Marvel movies and one DC movies like Wonder Woman, but I wanted him to see this movie before it left the theatres and we came in with low expectations. Boy, we were wrong. This film picks up years after the events of Captain America: Civil War, in which Black Panther debuted on screen for the first time, as the main character, T'CHalla (Chadwick Boseman), deals with the passing of his dad from an assasination that was shown in Civil War, and is on a quest to become the next king of Wakanda, the world from which he was born into. The only thing standing in his way is the Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), who is the main bad guy of the movie. Chaos then ensues before all is settled in the end. Make sure you stay during the credits for two scenes, one in which Black Panther is at a UN meeting promoting world peace and before the movie's over Bucky Barnes as White Wolf, who will play a big role in Infinity War guiding T'CHalla's little sisters' team against Thanos and his army. I suggest you see it in 2d, as this film was converted in 3d just like every other MCU movie. The special effects are ok, the surround sound is amazing, and cinematography is amazing. Not only that, but there's lots of action, suspense, some humor, and as usual, a cameo by Stan Lee, this time in a casino scene reminiscent of a James Bond movie. The director of this movie also worked on Creed, not to mention Fruitvale Station. I can't wait to see what the sequel promises after the events of IW. Wakanda Forever!!!
Update : He survived Endgame after being killed in IW but the fate of the sequel is in limbo after the star died overnight of colon cancer at the age of 43. We will miss you T'Challa.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","It's quite funny to read so many derogatory reviews by Imdb users about this movie. Once seen it's obvious that they write it from a political agenda or from a very limited interest in entertainment movies or, worst, from a racist or sexist point of view.
I don't think that Black Panther is the best superheroe movie ever (The Dark Knight or The Avengers or Spiderman 2 are better from MHPOV) nor the most funny (Guardians of the Galaxy or Thor Ragnarok or Deadpool would be) nor the most entertaining (here the list could be longer including some of the previous titles I've mentioned) but I think that it could be considered the most serious take for a superheroe mainstream movie. 
The beginning of the movie with the not much subtle message of Wakanda First! and how this evolve for the main character along the story (whose end of evolution is certified in the first extra scene after the main credits) clearly tries to send a message to the trumpists (and probably a lot of them are reviewing very low the movie) Also it tries to send a message of reconciliation to those that want to revive the ala ""Malcom X"" ideology or revanchist actions (here one has to think about the riots caused by some judicial decissions when police officers killed some black people or due to the move away of Southern symbols) portrayed by Killmonger. Probably some machist and alpha males (maybe a lot of them lovers of the macho image that superheroes use to portray) could feel that a so equal depiction of women and men as Warriors (yes with capital!, leaded by Nakia and Okoye) or scientists (the perfectly seized and restrained funny Shuri) or whatever, threatens their comfort zone. It has a good story and as well structured as a perfectly narrated story has to; the hero has to suffer a change and it happens thanks to the lesson he learns from his antagonist. The perfect simbiosis of the two faces of human personality by the hero and his opposite.
Naturally this is a Marvel and Disney movie and these companies are not going to create a manifesto or a propaganda film hence they don't dig in those topics as an independent movie would do. Killmonger character lacks of a wider development and the talent of Michael B Jordan deserved it and the myth of Klaw in the comic books is roughly severed in behalf of the narrative but despite everything I think that being an entertaining production it offers much ideas than we are used to and as much as expected in terms of joy and fun.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","'Black Panther (2018)' portrays a perspective so often missing from mainstream media and is refreshing because of it, a vibrant and celebratory vision of an oft overlooked culture infused with the sci-fi futurism inherent to the genre. It actually feels rather unique, despite some of its more 'superhero' genre elements, and is typically a smaller, more character-focused affair than its counterparts. The special-effects can be slightly overbearing at times, though; there are some digital body doubles that both look dodgy and do some dodgy things. Still, thanks to the brilliantly written screenplay, this doesn't really take away from the believability of proceedings because we're always invested in our hero, who's as incredibly tangible and entertainingly combat-capable here as he was in his debut appearance. The feature is thematically rich and, occasionally, emotionally moving, too. It's accomplished, enjoyable stuff that represents some of Marvel's (and the genre's) best work to date. 8/10",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","After my sixth, or maybe it is my seventh viewing of Black Panther, I am finally ready to review it (Don't judge me-I tend to demonstrate compulsive behavior towards the movies I love). So if you have not seen it, I will not spoil it for you, but I also won't hold back my enthusiasm for the first big-budget film with actors predominately of African descent and Marvel's first Black black superhero.
When Chadwick Boseman's portrayal of Black Panther debuted in Captain America: Civil War, I knew something special was on the horizon from Marvel, but I did not know just how special it would be as a film. The fandemonium had reached epic levels: people were dressing up for the movie, there were social media campaigns to bring kids to the theaters in groups, and my community was creating all kinds of badass dance challenges on YouTube to celebrate the film's release. So part of the reason I needed to see it so many times was to ensure that the hype and enthusiasm I was experiencing in my community had not robbed me of the experience of appreciating all the craftsmanship that went into this movie. Marvel intended for it to be big-thus the $200 million dollar investment-but they could have never anticipated a reaction like this. I also needed to be sure this film stood up under scrutiny after multiple viewings because I knew I was already on a cultural high that would bias my review. So by my fourth viewing, the hype had waned for me, and now I was evaluating Black Panther for what it was-one of Marvel's most poignant and influential films in the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe).

","Centuries before the reign of King T'Challa, there were five African tribes at war with one another over the strongest metal in the universe. The first warrior ingests this metal giving him super-human powers, which he uses to unite all but one of the tribes who refused to accept peace. This newly formed truce between the four tribes creates the land known as Wakanda. An agreeance is made to isolate the country from the rest of the world and use the vibranium to advance their nation far more ahead of any other civilization and became a technological superpower but hid it from the world making it seem like a third-world country. Following this the storyline flashes back in time to 1992 when the father of T'Challa, King T'Chaka pays a visit to his brother in California where he accuses him of helping an arms dealer gain possession of the vibranium.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","Black Panther is definitely not the biggest hero in the Marvel Universe. Well, in the comics he isn't. He also isn't the most popular, or the oldest, or the most powerful. But, he comes close to all of those and one thing he can claim is that he probably has the best movie adaptation out of all of the other super heroes in the Marvel Universe. The first thing I should mention about this amazing movie though is it's message! The movie introduces very complex themes and ideas, such as ""why would a country that could save the world hide from it"" and ""how can a man kill his own brother yet still lead a nation with expertise."" There's also almost constant social commentary and complex debates on various issues. So it is nice to see a movie that both makes us think and makes us ooh and ahh for once, especially one coming from Disney. The story is also great. It is also full of complex ideas and full of twists, though it also comes with a couple of kinks, but it is still pretty good. The acting is also great, Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan especially shining as the protagonist T'Challa/Black Panther and the antagonist Erik Killmonger. They are both amazing! The supporting cast is also great as well. Lupita Nyongo'o brings a nice hard ass vibe to her character of Nakia, the world desperately needs more characters like her and Dania Gurira is as equally hard ass as Nyong'o in the role of Okoye: The leader of Wakanda's all-female fighting force. The breakout Get Out star Daniel Kaluuya plays W'Kabi, the Wakandian government official who teeters between good and evil Letitia Wright plays Shuri, the witty and whip-smart younger sister/assistant to T'Challa. Wright is the movie's comic relief, and she is amazing at it! Some of the best lines from the movie are said by her. Andy Serkis, Forest Whitaker, and Angela Basset also star as the villainous cyborg terrorist Klaue, the mysterious Wakandian prophet Zuri, and the positive, mentoring, mother of T'Challa. The only bad thing is Martin Freeman's character Everett K. Ross: The very confused stalwart American CIA agent who accidentally figures out the secrets of Wakanda. His character seems a little-taped on. But on the plus side, Wakanda is beautiful. Through a combination of set pieces and CGI, the film makers were able to create a vividly beautiful country that looks very real and will probably be the standard for futuristic cities in the future for movies. Ryan Coogler is an amazing director, his vision permeates pretty much the entire movie. The entire movie is also packed with breathtaking Matrix-style action sequences that are fueled by adrenaline and CGI. The best is probably the South Korean car chase sequence or the fight between Black Panther and T'Challa. The final battle sequence is also not-to-be-missed as well. And, as always, the special effects are also great. And, on an ending note, the soundtrack (which includes All the Stars by SZA and Kendrick Lamar, Pray for Me by The Weeknd and Kendrick Lamar, and King's Dead by Jay Rock, Kendrick Lamar, Future, and James Blake) is downright amazing! It mixes African drumming with rap with orchestra. Now that is a feat. There is also a brilliant mid-movie twist but I won't spoil it for you.

","Problems arise from every aspect of film making. Character wise the two villains and Shuri were the strongest, yet as expected of a mcu movie they kill off the villains and Shuri is pushed towards annoying at the turn of the film, showcased with the outdated 'what are those' scene. Sadly this was probably the worst Martin Freeman character I have seen personally. The movie does attempt to do something new but then always pulls the rug away and reverts back to the standard formula continuously. The accents in the movie fluctuated madly which really took me out of it, funnily enough of the one to get it wrong Freemans accent was by far the most changing. The tech in the movie is misconstrued, somehow while Klaws arm can defeat BPs suit Shuri's most improved power ranger arms do little to KIllmonger at all. The cgi is also an area for concern and the movie couldve prospered more from a real life shot. Of course Marvel ruined strong scenes by adding one-liners to the end which really made many of the so called leaders and professionals of the film come off in a very childish manner unbecoming of their positions (free pass to Shuri as she of course was a child). Killmongers plan which probably sounded good at a first pitch really falls apart once you consider anything remotely about it, be it the fact that Wakanda only has 4 planes to transport the weapons and said planes take a silly amount of time to reach the outer limits which is just lazy writing in terms of timing.
Onto the good stuff,the easiest thing to state is the cultural representation which is showcased continuously throughout the movie. The two villains are both very good, of course Klaw taking the first half, and Killmonger taking the latter (of course this being easier with the other no longer around haha, which was needed since Klaw was a stronger character but didnt have the philosophical reasoning to fight like Killmonger). Lastly the basis of the philosophy of the film works wonders and carries it even though the philosophy never really improves upon the basis in any meaningful way.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","Deep down within Black Panther lies a great movie with a great message. Emphasis on the deep down, cause what we actually got is one of the most disappointing MCU movies ever. Where to begin with this! I'll start with the few things i liked. The score is nothing great and i personally much prefer original scores to just songs pilled together but still it's better than regular MCU ones. Michael B. Jordan does a great job as Killmonger (easily the best performance in the movie) and the directing and scenary is preety good and the costumes are nice as well (i much prefered the Civil War suit but whatever)! However, the negative outweigh the positive by a lot! The plot is as generic as humanly possible. Nothing more than *evil relative takes throne, hero takes it back* . Nothing new, nothing interesting and as predictable as possible (unless there was a person who thought Black Panther actually died midway through the movie)(also plot makes zero sense at all but its a Marvel movie so I'll allow it). Acting apart from Jordan is just ok, and some characters are extremely annoying (looking at you Shuri). The humour is also extremely mediocre and tries to pull off jokes that would have been considered funny 2 years ago (ahem, what are those) and i personally didn't laugh once. But those are just nitpicks compared to the 3 main problems! 1. Black Panther is too overpowered. He already was bulletproof, super strong, super fast and an expert martial artist. Did you really have to include the whole blast thing? That problem is prevalent with a lot of heroes but when he is so overpowered any sense of suspense is immediately lost. 2. The CGI is shockingly bad! One of the worst of all MCU movies! Like it certainly has some very nice shots but his animated suit is very poorly animated and the car chase and especially the final battle are hilariously bad in terms of CGI (literally looking like a PS2 game at times!). 3. Speaking of the final battle, the action is quite possibly the worst in any MCU film. Apart from the ok waterfall fight scenes, the first one is too dark to see anything, the car chase is ridiculous at best and the final battle is embarrassingly bad, in terms of logic, CGI, suspense... it fails at everything (once again a mediocre hero vs villain with exact samw powers final fight)! All in all this movie is a mess and it feels like it briefly took Marvel back to the early MCU. Unfortunately disappointing is the best i can say about it. 3/10 (Keep in mind i rate this movie solely as what i like and dislike about it as a movie! I am not reviewing it for its cultural effect or anything else in this review)",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","One of the most hyped movies I think has ever been released, 'Black Panther' is definitely something special for Marvel, but to cinema as a whole it is somewhat mixed. Most everything about it is at least competent (except for SOME of the lesser CGI effects), but the final battle is less than compelling or entertaining, sadly drowning out some of the really great things in this film that would make it more worth a rewatching. For most of the film's running time, I genuinely enjoyed it, particularly in its first half. There is some really good humor (although there were a few moments that were rather eye-rolling in their unfunniness), some great action (I thought every action sequence was almost perfectly handled UNTIL the lengthy and frankly boring battle the film climaxes with), some very interesting concepts explored in a very fair and well done way, and an extraordinarily compelling villain whose arc does contain some real sympathy and understanding. Much of the film is a fun, entertaining ride, but towards the end it does unfortunately fall apart and breaks into some pointlessly loud and disorienting scenes of generic action and such. A very good film that could have been groundbreaking if some flaws were fixed. Not as bad as some w/overly high expectations or even an alt-right-esque racial agenda might have you think, not as great as some liberal critics and hyper reactionary twitter users may have you think; instead, it is a bit of a fun improvement of the standard Marvel affair that contains various elements that I feel could have made up a masterpiece but were sadly put slightly down by some of the film's weaker ones.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","A flop in the MCU. The movie was over hyped and didn't step up for me as the rest of the marvel movies. They had a great character and story which in my opinion could have done much better than giving us a poor origin story. However, the last 30 mins of the movie was good and they managed to make us sympathize with the bad guy, which was a nice move.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018
1172,27 February 2018,nathanjohnsonc,7," Great Movie, but it's Not THAT Great
","I have been having a sort of ""burn out"" with superhero films lately, so I wasn't originally planning to see Black Panther at all. However, I kept hearing how great and awesome this ""masterpiece"" was, so I decided I would go see it (and at this point, it really is just something that's expected, which is fine). So, I went in with marvelous expectations (aside from some criticisms I had heard beforehand), and... how was it?
Well, let me just say that I enjoyed myself thoroughly. It was WAY better than I thought it was going to be, and it was really fun to watch. All of the performances are generally great (except for a few which I'll get in to), and the plot is good as well. There are some issues, however, that bring the movie down, which I'll go into spoiler free at first. Some of the special effects are just downright bad (there are bits where you can actually tell the person is standing in front of a green screen), and there is dialogue that is spoken that just seems... off. I don't know, it just seems misplaced and weird-sounding. Also, it is hard to ignore the fact that yes, the plot is good, it is certainly a Marvel plot, if you know what I mean.
My biggest issue with the movie, and the one that brings it down so much, is that there is a side plot that is completely unnecessary, and completely ruins the tone of the film. Basically, the only reason this side plot exists is to add a little more to the end, and to give the main characters a little more motivation. That's it.
In conclusion, check this out if you want a fun superhero movie, that's better than a lot of recent ones, but also has a few problems (7/10).",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","No consistency in this film. Wakanda has great technology and people dress well in some parts but then look half poor and half rich in other poverty-appeared areas. So much technology but primitive weapons. This really made no sense, but that basically sums up most of the movie.
The movie itself is longer than it needed to be, and it was god awful boring. This is probably the worst Marvel movie they have ever made. No humor, poor character development, and the plot is not clear until 70% into the movie.
The cinematography was also inconsistent. At one point I thought I was watching Men in Black, another resembled The Fifth Element, and another resembled King Arthur. Video quality quickly went from one scene looking like a movie you expect to see in 2018 with amazing CGI then the next few scenes look straight out of an 80s film.
The film bounced around areas with no real purpose. One moment in space, then in the jungle, then in Korea, then back home. Why was T'Challa bouncing all over the place? This needs to be better explained. His backstory is also almost nonexistent except for his one battle in the beginning over what exactly between the two tribes? Leadership? Food? What? This needs to be explained more clearly.
The lack of clear explanation of anything is why I can't give this movie anything more than a 3. That is being generous.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

It's visually beautiful beyond description. I didn't feel like I was watching a Marvel film, and I like Marvel films. It has IDEAS, political thought and a worldview in a way that no other Marvel film has attempted, and is meaningful and resonant in a way blockbusters almost never are. It's deeply non-western.

It's an afrofuturist dream and is, throughout, deeply moving. It's transformative not feelgood, deep not glib, unifying and courageous not divisive. It's better than Harry Potter, better than LOTR, better than The Hunger Games, better than the entire MCU. It takes everything tired about the superhero/epic fantasy/""hero's journey"" genre and transcends/ reconceptualizes it in a way that's never expected and consistently thrilling and gripping. It's impeccably paced and structured and flows completely naturally (in a world where blockbusters are so often a series of setpieces bridged by interstitial dialogue) - it's logical and coherent with plot and character in perfect harmony, nothing feels contrived, committee-written, focus-grouped or market-tested.

","This predominately African American superhero blockbuster attempts to break into the cultural diversity genre and offer up a more emotive, thoughtful collision between good and evil. In many ways it succeeds, yet it remains to be seen whether the depiction of African Americans are truly authentic and innately faithful to respecting cultural differences. There are suggestions that, like its stereotypical predecessors popularized for the Western audience, liberties may have been taken. There are several weaknesses in two of the early fight scenes that seem to be more for the screenwriter's convenience to move the storyline along rather to offer a more convincing display of intelligent preparations for combat. The male dominated action scenarios continue with some effort to provide some balance to the violence inherent in action-thrillers. What makes this superhero movie stand out a bit from the rest is its attempt at a humanistic theme that emerges in places but doesn't quite fulfill the potential of a truly classic movie of real depth. In some ways, this movie reflects the current political turmoil in America today as good and evil are on display in the morality of what a Country stands for.

","Black Panther presents outstanding visuals very much in tune with the Marvel cinematic universe.

He fails in every other aspect. Whilst striving so hard to bring a 'minority' people to the ticket booth - all 2 billion as they say in the movie - he has done a tasteless disservice to white africans, allowing dialogue such as ""colonists"" and ""another white person that needs fixing"" to permeate the film. This somewhat racist leaning language is interspersed by easily the most stereotypical and completely absurd wannabe African accents from actors with no idea how to do it correctly. Compounding this is Hollywood's go-to bad guy in all things African, the big, white, Afrikaans accented man that eventually gets killed, but not before telling how awful the people of an African country are.

","Black Panther uses the superhero genre to have conversations we're all currently having: ""Should we serve our country with blind commitment, or push back against the forces that are destroying it?"" ""Should we use our resources to protect our people, or help others in need?"" That deep interest in societal culture is in every frame of Marvel's latest venture. To be sure, it's a celebration of black culture, and a bright and proud one at that. However, it's also a celebration of culture in general, an awards assembly giving medals to those who lean into their own history, even while improving it. Those themes help Black Panther exudes confidence and power in even its quietest moments. 
Its vigor vibrates from the fictional country of Wakanda, a place so vibrantly beautiful and well-realized you'll wish to jump into the screen. The story of a prince-turned-warrior-king doesn't provide tons of plot-surprises or even a super compelling protagonist. Nevertheless, it soars in its emotionally exciting action scenes (waterfall ceremony), its stacked cast of characters (greatest superhero sibling ever?), and potent villain psychology.
Sure, Coogler has fallen into the Marvel trope of the hero having to fight the evil version of himself at the end of the film. It also follows the recent Marvel trend of creating villains who are empathetic and fully logical, to the point that you find yourself rooting for them. And with Jordan's Killmonger, we're shown one of the most rich and heartfelt antagonists in superhero history, making Boseman's Black Panther confront the truth in the film's line, ""It's hard for a good man to be king.""

","Created by Marvel creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in July of 1966, Black Panther was born in the Silver Age of Comic Book history becoming the first African American Marvel Superhero. With the creation of Black Panther, the black cat became a huge phenomenon in comic history that it made a feature film in 2018, with an unknown person playing the title roll by the name of Chadwick Boseman. 
 In the furriest of details, this movie has gained such momentum in the box office that it literally broke the box office within the first weekend. But let's get back to Wakanda. The birth place of the black prowler. We first met T'Challa, Black Panther, in Captain America: Civil War, when the Cap and Iron Man were on opposite sides of the government spectrum dueling for the survival of the Avengers. 
 Now we come to Wakanda and history of the way T'Challa became the prowler known as Black Panther. Now, I'm not going to sit here and spill out any details, but I will have to say that this movie has out beat all the other Marvel movies by far and to date. 
 I know that, without a shadow of a doubt, literally the shadows, that this movie will continue to go down in comic book history as the greatest superhero in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, all thanks to the director Ryan Coogler. As Kendrick Lamar swiftly puts it in the title track for the movie, ""This may be the night that my dreams might let me know. All the stars approach you, all the stars approach you, all the stars approach you. This may be the night that my dreams might let me know. All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer.""",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

Some scenes had an awkwardly bad green screen, unfortunately. A character in the end gets their throat slit and there was no blood?? No one wants to say it this way, but essentially what Killmonger wants is to kill an entire race. T'Challa's character is painted as a character whose decisions are all correct and morally justified. Most jokes in this movie are pretty bad, but Shuri's are the worst. Also, Ramonda disappeared and never came back??

There's one scene in particular that I won't spoil but I thought it would make a great ride at EPCOT. The last 30 minutes alone were worth the price of admission.

","First off, as a superhero movie, an action movie, a mass entertainment, it works like gangbusters. It is fun, never feels boring, is consistently surprising and inventive in its action sequences and introduces a lot of really cool stuff throughout the movie. But the reason that this movie is going to be so important, why it has become a cultural milestone before it ever was released is where this movie really shines. Ryan Coogler could have been buried under the weight of the expectations of making the first true big-budget superhero movie lead by an almost all black cast, but instead he made a movie that embraces and subverts those expectations and he has delivered an absolute triumph that celebrates the fact that it is an African movie, set 95% in Africa, with 99% African characters. It embraces the traditions, the culture, it does not apologize for its blackness because it is organic to who the characters are. The female characters in this movie are equals to the male characters in combat or even often superior, superior in intelligence, funny, independent and just alive in a way that most movies, but especially superhero movies, rarely allow them to be. And the villain, wow, Killmonger is a true villain, but he is one of the greats because his motivations are understandable, his motivations even make sense, but his solution to a real problem is where he is wrong. The final scene between Black Panther and Killmonger is brilliant, truly.

","This film essentially begins in ancient times with a meteorite composed of an incredible metal known as ""vibranium"" crashing into an area of Africa which is inhabited by 5 different tribes. Eventually, 4 of the tribes join together to form the nation known as Wakanda and use this new metal to advance their technology beyond anything the world has ever known. Equally important is the fact that a rare herb grown in that part of the world has been affected by the radiation from vibranium and, when ingested, gives a person superhuman abilities. This person is known as the Black Panther and he not only becomes the King of Wakanda but also serves as the protector for his people. Anyway, thousands of years pass and while the rest of the world advances Wakanda remains in geographical isolation and is thought of as an extremely backward country. But little does the world realize that Wakanda has technology beyond that of Western civilization and has chosen to remain isolated for fear of what might happen if their technology-and most importantly their vibranium-were to get in the wrong hands. That being said, when some vibranium is stolen the Black Panther is forced to go to America in secret and deal with the situation personally. Little does he know that his actions will have extreme repercusions for the rest of the world. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an excellent ""comic book"" movie that combined a dynamic plot, good acting and plentiful action throughout. I especially liked the acting of both Chadwick Boseman (as ""T'Challa"") and Michael B. Jordan (""Erik Killmonger"") who seemed tailor-made for their parts. On the flip side, however, I must also say that there were some minor flaws in the CGI and that I didn't especially care for the character of ""Shuri"" (Letitia Wright) who was unnecessarily annoying.

","After two comedy-heavy entries in its cinematic universe, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" and ""Thor: Ragnarok"", Marvel has finally come back to its senses with ""Black Panther"". Under the very capable hands of writer/director Ryan Coogler (who breathed life back into the Rocky franchise with ""Creed""), along with an all-star African-American cast, ""Black Panther"" brings a fresh approach to the comic book/superhero genre. 
Chadwick Boseman returns as newly-appointed King T'Challa after his breakout role in ""Captain America: Civil War"". He is joined by Danai Gurira (""The Waking Dead"") as his army general, Okoye; Lupita Nyong'o (""12 Years A Slave"") his ex-girlfriend and wanted spy; Daniel Kaluuya (""Get Out"") his close friend and Okoye's lover; as well as scene-steeling newcomer Letitia Wright as his tech-savvy sister, Shuri. Add in Forrest Whittaker (""Rogue One"") Angela Bassett (""9-1-1""), Michael B. Jordan (""Creed""), Sterling K. Brown (""This Is Us""), Andy Serkis (""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy) and Martin Freeman (""The Hobbit"" trilogy) and you have enough star power to energize a major city. But star power alone is not what carries this movie. It is the well-balanced story and grounded tone that makes it feel more like a Bond movie with hints of ""The Lion King"" and ""Game of Thrones"". 
What impressed me the most is the cultural relevance throughout the movie. The action scenes are good (although I prefer the action sequences in the Russo Brothers' ""Captain America"" films), the tech/gadgets are cool, and the humor is nicely placed to keep it light. But best moments are in Wakanda, where the African scenery, fashion, and culture are on full display. 
Kudos to Marvel for placing ""Black Panther"" into the right hands and kudos to the actors who felt the weight of each role and delivered on all counts. 
The only things that could have been improved were the action scenes (primarily hand to hand combat scenes), some sketchy CGI moments, and a rather sluggish first act.

","Story wasn't super one of a kind, but the first and second act established a lot of interest and mythos worthy of excitement. That is until the third act. It seemed the visual effects money was spent too much on the first two acts because by the last 45 mins there was very bad green screen backgrounds that didn't match the character lighting at all in some shots followed by some bad CGI. (There was a bit of this earlier but it was acceptable) The only other problem is the ending. T'Challa is a hypocrite! Killmonger wanted to expand Wakandas resources to help the rest of the world. Living in poverty while the Wakanda live gloriously infuriates him and this and the death of his father as a child, drives his character. T'Challa and the Wakandans are against allowing their resources to help those in poverty for fear of possible wars started with their technology. But once Killmonger is defeated, T'Challa turns around and opens Wakandas doors to the world. There was no reason Killmonger should been murdered by Black Panther (T'Challa) and the only reason there was a conflict is because Killmonger took the throne and presumably killed T'Challa, angering his family/friends and they took upon an act of revenge.

So little background on everyone throughout the entire movie. All characters are for sure wasted.

","Every time a MCU film comes out, critics hail it as ""Marvel's best film yet"" only for me to find it either good/average (Civil War) or complete trash (Thor: Ragnarok). So, when critics were calling Black Panther the best MCU film, thankfully, I didn't put much stock into it because I don't think it's Marvel's ""best""; that title still belongs to Winter Soldier...BUT I freaking loved the movie; it's definitely in my top 5 MCU films (maybe top 3 but I have to see it again before I can make that decision). The good: it showcased an African nation with different tribes, that were technologically advanced, and had their own natural resources that the world has never seen before. That's significant to me because a lot of African nations were stripped of their natural resources centuries ago, so to see this on screen was a breath of fresh air as was seeing African royalty as opposed to the usual impoverished Africans, gangsters, slaves, thugs, drug dealers etc... The performances were amazing...Boseman was great as usual but the stand outs for me were Letitia Wright (Shuri) and Danai Gurira (Okoye); I'm glad my daughter gets to see 2 strong, intelligent black females on screen. Jordan was a cool villain (a lot better than most of those crappy Marvel villains); I can always appreciate when you can hate a villain's actions but empathize with their motives. The bad: the CGI was rough in a lot of places and some of the action pieces were very muddled. There were a few slow areas, but I often find that happening with origin stories, so I can overlook that. Overall, I really dug this film; for now, I'll give it an 8/10 but that could change upon 2nd viewing. Bravo to Ryan Coogler and his team!!!",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

Too much has been made of it by SJW's claiming that if your white you inherently will give this film a bad review, people accusing me of being racist if I don't like a crap film will not force me to like it.

Everything about it was bland, generic and design to appeal to people who would rather make it a big political issue and start more animosity with white people, personally I think these politics should be kept out of it because a film should be about whether it entertains or not, back to Blade again where this film is just about the politics of you must like this or your racist this never happened with Blade he was universally loved by both Black and White people in effect this has undone a lot of the hard work films such as Blade did by ramming politics down your throat and has in effect been nothing but a racist film towards non blacks. In defense of the people actually involved with this film I am giving them the benefit of the doubt that this was not there intention and that all the crap with the SJW's comes from there inability to actually engage what little intelligence they have, I would also state that the Black community have also been forced into the middle of this by the SJW's because most Black people don't want to force being black as being and issue it's usually white middle class morons chucking tantrums as they obviously did not get enough cuddles when they were children.

","I find it ironic that for an ethnic race that is always in the limelight screaming for equality, for diversity, for attention...that the movie has no diversity at all when the movie is directed by a black person and written by two black people. If you google, 'black panther movie cast' and click on the cast icon, It shows 48 cast members of which 38 are black people, 8 white people, and 2 Asians. Don't you love the diversity in this movie? Movies and tv series have been changing characters from white to black lately. To give examples: Superman(Michael B Jordan's Superman), Mary Jane Watson(Spiderman), Kingpin(Daredevil), Catwoman(The Batman/Catwoman), Jimmy Olsen(Supergirl), Johnny Storm(Fantastic Four), Perry White(Man of Steel), Harvey Dent(Batman), Deadshot(Suicide Squad), Heimdall(Thor), Nick Fury(Marvel Studio Films), Martian Manhunter(Smallville/Supergirl), Alicia Masters(Fantastic Four), Pete Ross(Smallville), Iris West(The Flash), Electro(Amazing Spiderman 2), Baron Mordo(Doctor Strange), Callisto(X-Men Last Stand), Manchester Black(Supergirl), Starfire(Titans), Hawkgirl(Legends of Tomorrow) to name a few just in the Super Hero genre. If you are going to diversify and change the vision for the creator's characters, you are essentially changing the essence of the characters themselves. To give you examples: Black Panther, Luke Cage, Storm, Amanda Waller, Aqualad, Black Lightning, Bishop, Green Lantern John Stewart, Shadow Hawk, Spawn, Ironheart, Sunspot, War Machine, Lady Hawk, Misty Knight, Falcon, Shadowman, and Blade...let's diversify and make them WHITE.

1393,21 February 2018,Alanaji_16,," ""BLACK PANTHER""- My Review
","Just like we were introduced to Asgard in the Thor trilogy (although it was more fun in the the third movie), Black Panther introduces us to Wakanda, a place/Kingdom, hidden from the outside world in the continent of Africa.
Directed by Ryan Coogler, The plot follows the events after Captain America: Civil War, where T'Challa a.k.a. Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman ) , is to be crowned the king of Wakanda where he have to face his nemesis in the form of Erik ""Killimonger"" (Michael. B. Jordan) who has a past related to Wakanda.
Now I have to say that this is a more matured movie after Civil War. There is action and fun in good amount but the story is given more depth. Add to that the African Culture and background gives the film a new look and from the view of the MC universe.
Technical matters of the film are all done well. Be it the Cinematography, Editing ,Action or the exhilarating Background score..
Now to the performances...
Chadwick Boseman has done a perfect job as The Black Panther. Although he appeared in a brief role in Civil war, the depth of his character was felt more in this film. Equally brilliant was Michael B Jordan in a negative role bringing in the required menace and can be considered another best villain in the MC universe. The supporting cast was efficient. The ones who require a mention is Daniel Kaluyya,
Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Lupita Nyong'o and Letita Wright. Andy Serous in a small role has done well.
So all in all Black Panther is another feather in the cap of the MC universe and is a must watch...

Why didn't this goofy nation, light years ahead of the world, stop that genocide? I'll answer my own question: because the writer, producers and director didn't have an iota's worth of knowledge about the history of Africa nor did they bothered to do any research. The antagonist of the film was a conglomeration of hip hop gangsta clichés. The only believable character was the bewildered white dude going through the motions of acting. Hollywood has been the worst perpetuator of stereotyping in the history of the world. Anyone who liked this film and praised it was either phony PC virtue signaling, lacking in taste or both.

First of all, whole film some feeling would get a hold in my mind. Am i watching a modern interpretation of Lion King or Marvel version of Agent 007 ? 
I've read reviews that call this the best Marvel movie ever, but I found it to be a pretty average Marvel movie. And at the same time, a classy DISNEY film. That is not to say it is bad, but film where Black Panther supposed to get his own movie, not about his character a bit disappointed me.

It has a plentiful array of dazzling costumes, inspiring set design and different cultural elements which are well-observed. The use of CGI provides a beautiful backdrop of a near idyll. Alas, the characters do not stand out from the beauty and sweeping majesty of the stage backcloth. The film is also impeded by the studio's anodyne dialogue which feels like design-by-committee. T'Challa, the King, is played well but the character lacks dimension. Martin Freeman's character is smooth-talking but with a turn of phrase more akin to a freshman than an airman.

","I love the MCU, but, there have been one or two movies that are much weaker than the rest; the first Captain America movie and The Incredible Hulk weren't that great and now add Black Panther.
It could have been so great, but, it lost me when we're told that it was hidden from the rest of the world. Pre spy satellite days you could have got away with that premise, but, not today. I was expecting them to explain how they have a shield over the main city to hide it from satellites, but, the writers clearly expected us to swallow the idea that it was not visible, for goodness sake, they can spot Kim Jong Un's train sitting on a siding in satellite photos. There was a total lack of logic regarding the premise of Wakanda being hidden from the rest of the world. By the way, Erik flew a plane into Wakanda without any problem, but, no else had done it before? Come on.
That aside, Chadwick Boseman is just so bland. I didn't warm to him in Civil War and I thought they could round out the character better in his own movie, I was wrong. The female characters were strong, which was one of the few pluses. The costume design was outstanding.
At the end of the day, it is entertaining, but, a best film Oscar nomination? No, especially considering movies like Thor:Ragnarok and Captain Marvel are many times better and not even got a hint of an Oscar nomination.

","Black Panther, the movie, was brilliant. From the themes, to the story, to the CGI and the incredible costumes, sets and photography, it transported the viewer to a virtual feast! 
The theme of good vs evil is nuanced by the characters who are flawed and full of passion. The storyline is almost too true, because relatives are often the warring factions in the desire to rule. The hero, T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), is both tempered and empowered by knowledge of history, diplomacy and the super-strength arising from a combination of an herb drink and the verbanium (bullet proof) suit. 
Each character is unique. M""Baku (Winston Duke) stood out with his arrogance and compassion; his strength and moral compass-a delightful break from the expectation of a villainous competitor for the throne. 
The genius Scientist sister, Shuri (Letitia Wright), offers both technology to engender envy in James Bond and intelligent humor as a sibling sidekick. 
Michael B. Jordan's vulnerable and self-confident portrayal of the villain-relative with his viable grief and a passion to gain what he believed he was entitled to, offers the chance for a healing even in death. 
Okoye, played so well by Danai Gurira, she dominated every scene-drawing my eyes to follow her every action. Lithesome and sinewy with an athletic prowess any girl might crave, she makes the essence of womanhood desirable, and baldness alluring. Amazons, move over!
So many actors enriched the drama. So fun to actually see Andy Serkis (Ulysses Kaue) with a human face. Zuri (Forrest Whitaker) compels us to see both sides of honor and dishonor. Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) brought a quiet strength to the future queen. Angela Bassett's queen mother, Ramonda, brings her understated elegance as a supportive mom to the role. 
The writers drew me into the story and made me want to visit Wakanda, with the rich colors and textures, technology balanced by logic and humanity. The struggle to share knowledge, when you know that some might turn things into war and destruction instead of building up families and traditions. 
As a WASP, I was glad to see that Martin Freeman's CIA character, Everett K. Ross, was welcomed ultimately, cuz I'd hate to be left out. Don't we all want to be a part of Wakonda?

","There was a ton of CGI used in Black Panther. So much so that it was getting annoying. Standing structures look really good in Wakanda (Asgard and the Amazons Island looked great in the marvel universe as well). It's the mixing of live action and CGI that don't Jell, hopefully they get better using CGI and fix this in later movies (for example the fighting rhinos just looked ridiculous).
 Every motivation and jibe thrown in this movie was clearly pandering to the left. This made me sad, to me a superhero movie is supposed to be good fun for everybody. I don't need to site examples of the politics in play they're just so blatantly ""there"" you can't miss them. Unfortunately not even superhero movies are safe from politics anymore.... 
The plot of the movie was weak, there were no surprises to be found. Everybody knew T'challa was still alive and that he would be back (T'challa losing that fight to Warmonger and being tossed over that convenient waterfall was easy to forshadow). Why this society let Warmonger take over and remain in power after his first decree was to burn all of the black panther plants was amazing. At that point everybody should have just agreed to kill him, but they didn't because, movie.

1494,6 May 2018,rjlyness,10," Emotion, Character development, and Stunning Visuals all while avoiding the Cliches of recent Marvel films.
","This film seems to have done something that many Marvel films have been lacking in recent years, it conveyed real emotion. 
There wasn't the regular reliance on quick witted jokes when fight scenes were becoming boring which have become commonplace in Thor, Dr Strange, and Avengers. Instead each fight scene was important for the development of the plot and the character arcs often showing us the struggles characters had choosing their loyalties between country, humanity or their loved ones.
This movie avoided, for the most part, the cliche of the all powerful object which if the enemy get their hands on it will bring about the destruction of the universe as we know it. In Black Panther the story trying to be told is of the dangers of isolationism and the conflicts and caveats to blind loyalty to your country not the normal story told in Marvel films of fighting against the threat of the destruction of the universe. There a thread of ideas weaved throughout this film, illusions to the injustices of colonialism and slavery, and the many injustices that persist in our world today like the ever widening wealth inequality on earth and across the USA. This change of tone may have thrown some regular Marvel enthusiasts off slightly but it is vitally important. I believe that the inability to see these messages or the rejection of the truth in them is something that has driven many bad reviews on this site.
The director and writer managed to build multiple interesting characters all with developed characteristics and understandable reasoning behind their actions. Our main antagonist for example had an important relatable world view and his motivations were not so different from many of the hero's of Marvel and DC.
I am thoroughly shocked at the amount of negative reviews on this site and have noticed that the only criticisms they have been able to conjure could be applied to any comic book based film from the last 10 years. It seems they've been placed here to slander the film when there is little evidence that any of these 'critics' have actually taken the time to watch this film.
I need not mention the great things this film has done for the empowerment of poc and women. As a white man I may be the wrong person to represent what Hollywood's acceptance that a film like this needed to be made means to the world. With a nearly all black cast and strong female characters in positions we wouldn't normally see them in technology and war we're finally seeing some progress. I'm happy to see that Hollywood is changing its ways and I hope this isn't just an isolated example.
Along with Winter Soldier, Guardians and Wonder Woman I rate this as one of Marvels greatest successes, I hope they continue to make movies like this in the future and less of the over reliance of Bathos that we've seen in recent years in Dr Strange and Avengers.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

Movie is MATURE, very carefully written, i watched it when i was 17 and till now i watched it more then 5 times, i really understand ryan's vision and he nailed it!! Chadwick's character was written from very realistic perspective! He tried to do right thing everytime, and he understands nobody is perfect with more empathetic then other, you might change the world, be open to new ideas...... this are core human values that everyone should have!! TRUST ME THIS MOVIE IS DEEPER THEN 1 TO 5 STAR reviews!! With unbiased viewpoint i can tell you casual to die hard fans they will give it from 6 to 10!! This movie was not boring, not at all but if you were raised with conservative principles, then obviously you will hate this movie bcz its spreads the message of accepting new ideas and be more empathetic bcz not all people are bad inherently, that does not mean killmonger aint bad, he killed people, and he kept going to that route and ya he did not deserved that childhood!! Chadwick loved his dad and always believed in him and his ideology but his son also believed in HELPING! Yes people will always tell you to do certain things, but if you believe in yourself in HELPING others in right way then you must do the right thing!! Learn from msitake, learn from past/history and move on with more progressive ideas! Thats how you make world better place and ryan understands that very well!! CONSERVATIVE IS ALL ABOUT CONSERVING YOU PAST IDEOLOGY, AND WE ALL KNOW PAST IDEOLOGY IS DIEASES, RACIST AND HOMOPHOBIC AND TRANSPHOBIC!!

Unlike the other Marvel movies, the characters demonstrate a certain charisma, in the case of Martin Freeman, who does a good job. The main character is still learning about everything and this is notorious throughout the film, something that is transmitted to the viewer. The villain is represented with a particular motivation, which causes the spectator to divide in certain parts, doubting if he should support the hero or the villain.

","Beautiful people trying to save a paradise. First and foremost this movie is a superhero backstory movie. I had to keep this in mind because I was distracted and put off by poorly written, undeveloped sub-themes. As much as it presented itself as African proud, a hidden culture built on science, technology and the idea of supercities, cloaked under rural Africa, there were constant failed attempts to connect these characters to the American Black experience, so much so they lost track of their own backstory. For example, toward the end of the movie there is a moment when a sympathetic villain thinks he is about to die and he defiantly says, something to the effect of, ""throw me into the ocean as so many of my ancestors chose to die rather than to live in bondage!"" This character's ancestors were never enslaved and shipped to America, his father went from a palace to America as a spy, and, he himself was an offspring of an aristocratic super society. So I hope you won't be distracted, as I was, from the driving force of the film which is the rise of a superhero, a celebration of heroism, strength and justice - the anthem of superheros. I believe there is inspiration in seeing people, who look like you, behaving nobly, and, so, I am glad to see a movie with a talented black cast telling super human stories. The acting was good, the CGI was spectacular as were the action scenes. The cast had many superstars, (British Martin Freeman, our token white person, playing a rough, tough CIA operative was remarkably convincing).

Very cool but the plot and origin was kinda make you say ""that's it?'' the pacing was good but compare a stand alone superhero movie like captain america or ironman this movie is below the rank from how this hero become a hero. The part that i love is that the fact that we finally see some more of cool super hero that aren't just blone hair and blue eyes type of hero. No hate to other movies but if you really think about it, you will see the pattern. This movie has potential to be the one of my top superhero movies but the dialogues,origin story of characters are less interesting but look in the positive over all of this movie? It is not AS bad but also definitely not the best. I just wanna say that i enjoyed it as much as it gave so would say that i love this movie. Also this movie has the best endcredit song ever!!

Jordan.I'm understand where he's coming from and how it lead him to become the man right now so when he died it actually very touching and I think if the MCU need a main villain specific for the world of Black Panther like Loki to Thor or Red Skull to Cap.

1594,17 March 2018,patrickp2001,9," I don't understand how I'm reading so many negative reviews
","Walking into this film, I'll admit I was rather skeptical. I was hesitant to buy all the hype, because I thought that people liked this movie only because it was the first black main character in the MCU and one of few blockbusters to take place in Africa. However, I was very pleasantly surprised by a dynamic and compelling film with layered themes and intriguing characters that largely sets itself apart from most superhero films. Ryan Coogler, who directs this film brilliantly as expected, creates a fascinating world for the story that is both cultural and innovative. The script is also fantastic, with a concise plot structure and good dialogue. The script establishes complex characters who are flawed but sympathetic, and who all are simply fighting for what they feel is right. What this film accomplishes most impressively is the main conflict between T'Challa and the main villain Killmonger. I was very mad reading reviews that criticized the villain, saying that ""we need to hate the villain, or else we won't root for the hero."" But what this does is create two-dimensional characters and a boring, by the numbers conflict based off simplistic good vs evil. Instead, by providing a sympathetic character with motives we understand and a hero who's flawed, we're simply seeing two human beings in an ideological conflict, similar to the relationship between Joker and Batman in The Dark Knight. Personally, I think this was a great film that I consider one of the best MCU movies I've seen so far (comparible to Civil War, Thor:Ragnarok and the first Guardians of the Galaxy), with compelling characters, brilliant acting and well-executed action scenes.

","Besides the clear political undertones of the film, the way the film states that an African nation can be the top of global technology and social ladder, the film fails on a few key areas. Firstly, the acting is good but the basic story is rushed and filled with posturing from a few stars. The lead offers the viewer the best possible example of man in charge, to the point that it feels forced. The ending is clear from the start and the only good bit is how that was set up.

The black girl nutures the safe Caucasian - typical. The black woman is fierce and combative to the man she loves - typical. African vs African American - ""Not Cool."" This film recieved so much praise for being a 'breakthrough' film for Africans and I would have been able to appreciate completely if it did glorify injurious realities that have disadvantaged and even mentally enslave african people to inferior freedom as a people globally and carry forward the status quo just with a most black cast this time.

","I decided to see ""Black Panther"" once again with the recent death of Chadwick Boseman, who starred in the eponymous lead.

Although not always the case, as the loss of most silent films to inappreciation and inflammable nitrate have attested, film has long been considered as a sort of afterlife. Like family photographs, they're memories captured indefinitely. Chaplin, Garbo, Bogart, Monroe, Brando--many cinematic icons have long since passed, but they continue to flicker on this ancestral plane of motion-picture screens. This long pantheon now includes Boseman. His legacy will endure. We see this in his hero's journey as T'Challa, a.k.a Black Panther, too, of life, death and rebirth.

1697,26 February 2018,gigitville,9," Marvel Needs to Stay Down This Awesome Path
","I was very excited for this movie for a while. I work at a movie theater, and I never got sick of seeing trailers for it. And fortunately, the movie delivered awesomely. There were a few things I didn't care for, but no movie's perfect.
Starting with the cons. T'Challa's mom didn't really do anything? She should've had some more things to do in the story. Some of the exposition and beginning could've been shortened. I liked that they took their time, but it's almost like they did it too much in the beginning and too little at the end so they could've balanced it out. The ""what are those?!"" comment was just... unnecessary. Come on Marvel. And I wish Michael B. Jordan had more screen time because he was fantastic, the best Marvel villain overall in my opinion, and did an amazing performance. Some of the technology seemed a little far-fetched, and since they didn't expand on how most of it really worked, it makes the characters seem pretty invulnerable at times. Though they counteract it well at some points, like taking away Black Panther's superhuman qualities when he fights for the throne. 
The majority of the movie was the pros. All the performances were great, I don't think there was one character that was acted poorly. Micheal B. Jordan and Chadwick Boseman are both stars that deserve more positive attention, because they're fantastic in everything I've seen them in. This is no exception. Adding onto this, pretty much everyone also wen through character development to some degree, which is unfortunately a rarity in most blockbusters. However, Ryan Coogler is definitely a director that cares about that sort of thing. I certainly want to start a petition for Marvel to hire more directors with visions of their own. Taika Watiti and now Ryan Coogler, very good calls. All the characters were just so well-written, it made me so happy. Especially all the strong and well-written female characters. See Hollywood? It's not hard to do it. It felt so natural and made so much sense, they were all treated with so much respect and I'm over the moon. We need more strong and well-written female role-models in movies, especially those of color. And not all of the, were just ""hot girl who kicks ass and that's it"" either! Yay! I actually found myself wanting more close quarters action, since the stunts and fight choreography were both amazing. The way the love story with T'Challa and Nakia was approached and written was refreshing. It wasn't like literally almost every other Marvel movie where the characters meet in the movie and fall in love within the events of the movie. T'Challa and Nakia had a history, a believable one, and we were rooting for them to get back together. And when they did, it wasn't one of them making a sacrifice for the other. T'Challa offered Nakia a way to fulfill what she wanted while still being close by. One thing I was worried about was they wouldn't blend the traditional African culture with futuristic imagery that well, and that it'd be clunky and unnatural. But this was something that was actually done pretty well, and in a believable way. Overall, fantastic movie.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018
1698,29 April 2018,vinniec-53536,6," Good, But Not Great
","'Black Panther' is being praised as ""Marvel's masterpiece"", but unfortunately it didn't quite live up to the hype for me. The film's first act is enjoyable, where we are told the origin of the African nation of Wakanda and introduced to the main characters. Sadly though, the second act felt drawn-out and kind of boring, and the film never seems to regain it's momentum after that. The scenery is beautiful and it is very well-shot. Wakanda is easily one of the coolest and most vibrant locations in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and I can't wait to see more of it in May's 'Avengers: Infinity War' (YAY!!!). Some of the acting was terrific, particularly Black Panther's sister Shuri (Letitia Wright), the film's primary villain Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens (Michael B. Jordan), and secondary villain Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis). Shuri and Klaue served as the film's comic relief, and their humor was refreshing and on-point. Killmonger is definitely one of Marvel's best villains to date. He was intimidating and captivating to watch. Unfortunately, Black Panther himself (Chadwick Boseman) didn't seem to show much emotion and struck me as very monotonous. The action scenes were pretty cool, but some of them were too dark and I didn't always know who was who, which made them hard to follow. The end fight between Black Panther and Killmonger felt very CGI-heavy, which took away from the enjoyment. Although I like the design of Black Panther's new suit more than his first suit from 'Captain America: Civil War', it looked too cartoony for my taste. It was even more unfortunate that Killmonger had the exact same type of suit with a different design. Overall, 'Black Panther' was good, but fell short of great.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018
1699,2 February 2020,alliohaha,3," Black Panter
","It's a weak movie. It's too long, boring at times.
Being based on a comic book is a common handicap for Hollywood movies these days. Although it didn't stop Christopher Nolan from making some great films about a grown man in tights and with stupid rubber ears.
Let's face it: this movie brought so much money only because it was made a political statement. It was shoved down everyones throats as the first movie about a black superhero, made by black people. And it was a completely commercial move and actually hurt the officially declared cause. The only thing it proved is that black people can suck at making movies just as hard as white people do. Wait, maybe that was the point! Aha, than it was a win! Of sort... I guess...
Anyway, it should have made a point. It must have with all the hype. And the point apparently is that no matter how advanced is the technology africans get, their society is unable to evolve past primitive tribalism and monarchy.
Well, then the point is africans can achieve something important only when a magic meteor falls right on their heads, not on their own. 
Generally speaking, if you perceive the movie as a story that was supposed to tell us something about black people, and it was definitely advertised as such, the message you end up with is very bad.
Giving Oscars to a weak movie was clearly part of political censorship and just proves again the award has really nothing to do with a film's quality.
There are parts that I liked watching, like all bits with Andy Serkis. He would have made a great antagonist, but was retired too early. With him gone action loses appeal.
The civil war at the end is lame. There's no feeling Wakanda has advanced economy or military might. All you see is a couple of fliers and no heavy weaponry, lots of spears, though. The final battle looks like a brawl at a bar.
Ideological content is weak as well: they oscillate between isolationism or imperialism and at the end choose to come out and ""share"" technology. I wonder how would that work in modern economy.
Final verdict: weak, but it's always a pleasure to see Andy Serkis work.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

1741,17 February 2018,thedarkrd,10," Black Panther Has to be established in his own backyard, before the world sees him
","It is not often that I take the time to write a review, but I believe for this movie it is in order. First, Black Panther as a character in the MCU has to be established in his position socially, politically, and globally - done, done and done. Second, the acknowledgement of T'Challa as a world force to be reckoned with is established in the context of his rule as King. For those who don't know, Black Panther/T'Challa is the only superhero who also is a head of state - this point is established solidly in his prior showing in Captain America: Civil War. Lastly, there is the ever looming conflict of how does a country engage the rest of the world when that world has shown hostility towards its potential advancement?
Those questions are established and debated strongly in this movie. While regarding the potentiality of development one African society could experience if never encroached upon by the outside world. Once again, the form and structure of the challenges for T'Challa and what he faces in overcoming these issues and shortcomings is established. Black Panther has to set the context of his story within his own domain, faced with having to overcome the habits of the past with the needs of the future. Black Panther sets up his further development into the MCU and the stories to come. What I respect about this film is despite it being fictional, it gives dignity to the issues Africa has faced from the 15th century unto present day. It approaches the issues of African vs African Americans and people who are considered the Third World, and the true misnomer it must be in regard to a society left to grow untouched by the outside world.
It tackles the homecoming aspect of African peoples reaching out to its descendants and antecedents. Black Panther covers an extraordinary amount of ground, establishing traditions, rites of ascension, acknowledgement of duty above personal interest or belief, understanding of community interest over individual interest. Ryan Coogler does an excellent job in the co-writing on this movie to set the tone for a character whose challenges are not only individual but global, socio-political, and scientific. I give this movie a 10/10 because if you understand the history, and how it is referenced and addressed, the MCU and Marvel Studios does not fail to pay respects not only to a challenging character to portray, but to ensure it pays respect to the cultural heritage which it is connected to. Black Panther is a broader character whose powers are not simply attached to his individual perspective on right and wrong, or good over evil, but the management of those powers in the protection of an entire nation and its diverse peoples (use, diverse - 5 tribes who warred, but established peace and established Wakanda). All in all, the powerful, and human figures. The dry and focused humor which are natural in such situations. Furthermore, the well defined personal values of beauty and power (especially amongst the Dora Milaje), and men who say what they mean, and mean what they say having the restraint to know how to excercise such power.
Go see Black Panther - judge for yourself, and before you decide it's not your typical MCU movie - That's the point, he's not your typical Marvel character. Enjoy!",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

It almost didn't felt like, ""Marvelish"", in fact, it almost didn't felt like any mainstream superhero movie I've encountered over the past two decades since I was born for it tells more about the people and the reality some of us face around the globe than the hero himself. The effect of colonialism, racism, slavery, hatred, and the supremacist movement was put inside the heart of one man who is most likely to be the hero than the main character himself (whose alter ego becomes the very titular of the movie) had 'Black Panther' written as a literary source from the 18th - 19th century where slavery was at its peak: Erik Kilmonger.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","Being the 18th film of the MCU and the last film before the highly awaited and anticipated Infinity War, Black Panther reintroduces the African based superhero (as he was introduced in Civil War) in his own solo film and boy was this one an unexpected surprise. I was suspecting the same routine that the previous films that we have seen, not to say that it's bad as I love Marvel regardless but it's director Ryan Coogler (Creed) has managed to bring a fresh coat of paint to the storytelling of the movie whilst delivering a style that is unique and beautiful.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

1755,9 April 2018,12_Monkeys,8," A refreshing script in the Comic Character world
","It's now been a while since I actually enjoyed watching a superhero flick at the movie theater. Don't get me wrong, I used to LOVE superhero films, but ever since the formula worked so well (money wise) for the studios, the scripts have unfortunately lost all meaning. Thank God, this is not the case for Black Panther.
Although the film does start somewhat as a low-paced, vfx plastered (specially in the fictitious world of Wakanda), cliché adventure film, if you can power through the first 10 to 15 minutes or so, you're gonna be in for a treat.
What I loved most about Black Panther is the fact that each and every important character in the story has a well shaped backstory, they all have clear motivations for their actions, and the melodrama of the family relationships works perfectly, because it gives all of the main characters a conflict that is much needed in these types of films, and as we move forward, the plot thickens, and the stakes rise. All in all, a well written film with marvelous performances (even in small roles, as Sterling K. Brown shows us).
The script finishes off with a much needed message that envelops the whole point of the film: ""...in times of crisis, the wise build bridges, while the foolish build barriers."" The relevance of this film shoots up to the sky, when the theme is so intertwined with what's going on in the world right now. And the fact that the screenwriters managed to write in a message like this, in the context and with the studio pressures that come with a blockbuster type of film like this one, is something to stand up and clap about, if you ask me.
I can only hope that the sequel to this film does the first one justice, and I can almost be sure it won't, but oh well... that's Hollywood.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

It doesn't rely on huge doses of humor as an excuse to cover it's story (like Thor Ragnarok, as much as I liked that), but instead gives each and every character a chance to grow and mature for us to care about. The story also has many interesting themes and twists, as does the social commentary about race.

","Feels like a Shakespearean play and this is why the film works so well. It has a great story and one of the best screenplays Marvel has ever prodded. It offers a strong story with many interesting characters, mixes this with great action scenes and delivers a great visuality in general.
The only thing that could have been better was the acting. Why everybody was solid nobody really was at the top of their game. I guess that is still something Marvel has to learn, now that they stat to produce great screenplays. Again, dont get me wrong, Chadwick Boseman was great in the leading role but I felt that his co stars Lupita Nyong'o and especially Michael B. Jordan were there and just did their thing without much passion. I also thought Forest Whitaker once again adds an overacting credit to his resume, which is a shame. Angela Bassett was good and I really liked Martin Freeman and Danai Gurira. Andy Serkis also made a decent villain.
Daniel Kaluuya also doesnt really live up to his recent Oscar nomination and I felt the performance of Letitia Wright was a bit off. But other than that it is close to a masterpiece.

","A lot of the bad reviews say that the movie doesn't have enough action. I have to disagree with all I have on that. It is action packed and not too preachy. Micheal b Jordan's character, killmonger was the preachy one and he was the bad guy for a reason. The good guys, black Panther and friends where against the anger that killmonger had. The movie is not anti-white, I would not even say it was pro-black. The movie was just about a fictional African country with resources far beyond any other place on Earth. It is action packed and semi-realistic. All of the bad reviews say that it was like the Lion king. I saw that too, but what you have to realize is that these common things come from different parts of African folklore and a mixture of inspirations. Plus, the lion king was awesome. I am not going to act like I dressed up in a dashiki to see this movie or that I suddenly was really proud of my heritage or anything. THE MOVIE WAS GOOD, not life changing, remember that. Ignore whatever preconceived notions you have going in to the movie theater. The fact of the matter is this is something different and it is really hyped up. Go in expecting everything that you see from the bad reviews and you will be very very happy with the movie. Anyway, the plot was great, and if you like games like battlefront or halo, you will love this movie. It has classic one on one fight scenes as well as a lot of audience scenes where you feel really involved. I also like that Martin Freeman's character was not seen as some scared white guy or as a useless wimp. In some of the reviews that is the persons problem with the movie, but T'challas sister, who is the tech whiz, had to help to heal him and said ""Oh great, another broken white boy to fix.""

If you have ever questioned whether representation on screen is truly important, just look at the philanthropic movements surrounding this movie. With the ""Black Panther Challenge"", money is being raised so that black youths--who could not afford to see it themselves--can go watch the film. The amount of love surrounding this movie almost matches the film's own innate messages, and it shows just how powerful the medium of film can be. This is exactly why movies are made. So while we take the time to discuss and analyze the film, it's important to have this preface of the significance of this movie, as that is far more important in the long run than all the tiny details and Easter Eggs Marvel fans will pick apart and debate. With that said, Black Panther is a really great movie.

","Is the super hero movie genre running out of steam and making people feel fatigued? Probably yes, but what makes Black Panther stand out is that the audience is transported to a new land of Wakanda. Where we see diversity and culture. Where the message at the end is we don't just stand for ourselves anymore, but the world. We aren't seeing a superhero who is just discovering their powers in a neighborhood or city but instead a man who is to become king and making more of a bigger decision to not just helping his own people. This movie has fun action and great music that is influenced by this fictional country based in Africa. People have high expectactions for a formula that Marvel has been using for years now and that is why they come out disspaointed. Expect a fun movie with action and comedy elements with a few cameos or easter eggs, that is the way of Marvel.

","To say that Black Panther is the best Marvel movie of 2018 feels pointless since we have yet to see the rest of 2018's Marvel films, including Avengers Infinity War, Deadpool 2, Ant-Man and the Wasp, and Venom. This film created a massive wave of audience and critical praise as if it were a landmark. This is primarily due to how it managed to shine the spotlight on a fictional African universe that was visually as appealing as Thor's universe, Asgard. For many people of African decent, this was their movie. However this wasn't the first black comic book film to be released as many say it is. It may be in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but if you're asking for the first comic book film based on a black protagonist, the Blade franchise beat Black Panther to it. What Black Panther is is Marvel's first African superhero film to take place in the MCU, set in his country with the majority of the secondary characters being African themselves. The fact that there are fewer white skinned protagonists in the film than there are black gives it great significance. ",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

Many themes were well explored, such as African culture, isolationism, and ancestry. I didn't think the conflict development was anything special (felt like a simplified version of The Dark Knight Rises), and the climax was good, not great.

Micheal B Jordan provides a great performance as Erik Killmonger and the character has really good depth and a back story that makes him a convincing Bad Guy, possibly the greatest MCU villain we've seen yet. T'Challa's little sister Shuri steals many of the scenes she is in. Wakanda is beautiful and the movie was beautiful. Black Panther is made up of a predominately African American cast as it should be and provides and rich culture and shows us what an African nation would look like if it wasn't conquered.

This movie does does no set ups for sequels or other movies. (Unless u wait for end credits) It strictly holds its own as a solo superhero movie. And of course it speaks to black audiences like no other before it. So obviously NOT EVERYONE will relate to the allegorical messages.

","Well, it's not surprising that Avengers: Infinity War is going to become one of the biggest box office successes in cinema history. This film has been out for less than a week and already pretty much everyone who goes to the cinema has seen it, except for me. I haven't seen it yet because I don't get the urge to do what everyone else is doing. So, I'll probably wait until I can borrow it from some library. I actually like the films that Marvel makes, but I don't jump up and down every time one of those films is released. My favorite MCU films are Thor (2011), Ant-Man (2015), Iron Man (2008), The Incredible Hulk (2008), Doctor Strange (2016), Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), and Thor: Ragnarok (2017). Pretty much all the Marvel films are enjoyable, but the ones that I've listed are my favorites. The recently released Black Panther isn't one of my favorites. It's not a bad film by any means. It's good. It's more serious that the usual Marvel flick. It's just that only a few characters in the film appeal to me. The film also doesn't quite have the emotional weight that it should have. When it comes to the characters, it lacks the appeal of Thor or of Iron Man, for example. Since Marvel films contain some Anglo-American propaganda, it can also be interesting to see them because of what they're about. Some of the information in these films actually surprised me. For example, in Captain America: The First Avenger, the fictional terrorist organization Hydra uses some odd weapons and technology. Steve Rogers (Captain America) doesn't fight against regular German troops in the film but against Hydra troops armed with extraordinary weapons. Such weapons are usually the stuff of science-fiction, but I later learned that the Nazis did actually have some of those extraordinary weapons. Some of this technology and weaponry wasn't intended for mass production and some of it wasn't fully developed when Nazi Germany was defeated. So, for example, the Germans did have plans to create the Amerikabomber, which was a long-range strategic bomber for the Luftwaffe that would be capable of striking the USA from Germany. In the film, the Red Skull attempts to use a similar bomber to strike the USA. At one time, Adolf Hitler considered the creation a giant tank not so different from the one that the Red Skull uses in the film. So, if the Germans hadn't been defeated in World War II, such ""miracle weapons"" would have become a reality already in the 1940s or the 1950s. In the sequel, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, we find out that some members of Hydra were recruited by the American espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D after World War II. Something similar happened in real life too because the Americans did bring German and other European scientists, psychiatrists, and agents to the United States after World War II. Some of these people, like Ukrainian nationalists, were so-called war criminals because they were engaged in mass killings in Europe.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

The villain was better than in most previous MCU movies, but the writers still didn't give him anything with gravitas, for T'Challa to rise to the challenge in a memorable way.

The writing and the acting, on the other hand, are a different matter. Chadwick Boseman as ""T'Challa"" is about as wooden as they come as he returns to rule his outwardly agrarian African nation (""Wakanda"") that secretly has some state-of-the art kit based around a rare, but enormously powerful mineral from outer space. In this particular outing he isn't much helped by Martin Freeman (""Agent Ross"") or Forest Whitaker as the sagely ""Zuri"". Letitia Wright injects some charm as his tech-savvy little sister ""Shuri"" and for a bit at the beginning, Andy Serkis hams up nicely as South African arch villain ""Ulysses Klaue"" (pronounced claw) but once it settles down, it becomes a beautifully shot but rather bland, simplistic right vs wrong, do the right thing type of story. I do like Michael B. Jordan (""Erik"") - here he has a screen presence that is charming, cheeky and he knows how to work an audience - and I have to say I was on his side pretty much from the outset, but sadly though, the ending is never in doubt and with neither suspense nor jeopardy to sustain it's initial promise, ""Black Panther"" just ends up being a great looking, but pretty shallow festival of colour and CGI.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

When the film jumps to other locations around the world like London and South Korea (got to target that Asian market) I found myself wishing they would go back to Wakanda just because it is so visually stunning. The plot is solid and the actors are excellent. So much in fact, I wish they had spent more time on character development. The film seems to focus more on the villian, Killmonger, than the hero, T'Challa. I'm not complaining though, because Killmonger is an interesting character, and Michael B. Jordan is captivating. Black Panther brings up some heavy themes, and I think they could have gone further with them. Maybe in the sequels (I hope there will be sequels!) they will.

1946,29 December 2018,isaacj02,8," Subverting expectations; Coogler takes on Marvel's most exciting story yet
","Few predicted the level to which Marvel's Black Panther would become a cultural phenomenon. Director Ryan Coogler's addition to the MCU received acclaim from critics and audiences alike, as well as breaking an impressive $1 billion at the worldwide box office. Perhaps key to the success of Black Panther is the way that it thrills both fans of the superhero flick but also transcends the usual bounds of the genre, in its characters, design and themes. This is a film that subverts the typical Marvel formula, something which is long overdue.
Chadwick Boseman comfortably leads the film as the eponymous hero, venerable monarch by day and suit-sporting vigilante by night. T'Challa rules the nation of Wakanda, a futuristic and technologically advanced utopia shielded by a mask as a third-world nation. T'Challa's ex-lover, Nakia (played on expected brilliant form by Lupita Nyong'o) fights the case for Wakanda's moral duty to share the truth of their wealth; this is one of many surprisingly complex questions which weave their way satisfyingly into the narrative. Taking this even further is the film's villain, Erik Killmonger, a Wakandan isolated from the kingdom, calling for a revolution by black people against their oppressors. Michael B. Jordan is a charismatic villain, wonderful shades of humanity embedded within his performance, providing a fitting and scarily relatable foe for the Black Panther. A spunky ensemble (though prone to spouting exposition) completes the mix, Letitia Wright's Shuri acting as the Q to T'Challa's Bond and Martin Freeman delightfully Watson-esque as an obliging CIA agent.
For the most part, Black Panther is a stunning movie to witness, embracing its Afro-futurism with a colourful and vibrant design. The film feels very much buried in its cultural roots, which gives some understanding to the film's significance. Ludwig Goransson provides a luscious and innovative score and rap numbers courtesy of Kendrick Lamar complement the action.
The action sequences in the movie are also riveting; ""I never freeze"" pronounces T'Challa coolly in an early scene... and neither does the film itself. Pace never lags in relentless and sharp action sequences, gripping the audiences to their seats and, at some points, providing a strong emotional pay-off. The final act is certainly where the film is at its most disappointing, descending into an increasingly loud and banal CGI-fest, which, whilst not uncommon in a Marvel flick, is certainly beneath the calibre of Black Panther. Visual effects are also dodgy at certain instances, oddly plasticky and unfinished-looking. For the most part, however, Black Panther delivers soundly for popcorn moviegoers, never allowing its themes and cultural statements to overtake the pure entertainment.
One only has to see Black Panther to understand the reasons behind its sensation and the whisper of Oscars floating around. Ryan Coogler has crafted a visually staggering blockbuster, which manages to tell an engrossing story, with plenty of popcorn thrills, yet also a remarkably deep cultural message that boasts great relevance. Black Panther is without a doubt one of the most exciting and inventive Marvel outings yet.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","Black panther tells the story of how a man whos name I can neither pronounce nor write becomes king of Wakanda, a fictional African super tech culture.

Yes he has to face an evil villain as part of the journey and fight some evil bad guys and all the other standard superhero stuff. But nothing really excites in this movie. His powers are kinda average and meh, the story kinda drags and is pretty meh, the fake dialect is meh and the only thing the characters have going for them is the fact that they are pretty much all black - which to be honest doesn't bother me, but its also not an great argument to like a movie simply because of the casts skin color - but apart from that they are also pretty meh.

","Was a good movie. Entertained me, some nice action and comedy. I liked the vast majority of the characters and the acting. I thought the story was actually quite good too.
What I didn't like:
1) Way too much CGI. There's no reason why the developers could not have had martial artists in the Panther suits for the fight scenes. That would have been awesome but instead they opted for CGI characters and the CGI wasn't that good.
2) Not even a basic explanation as to how an ancient tribe managed to harness the technology of the vibranium meteorite. Iron Man is awesome because we know how the suit came to be. Similarly with Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Black Widow etc. That's what adds so much more to a story yet here we're supposed to believe that ancient people where able to harness vibranium and a teenager is the one and only brain behind most of modern Wakandan technology. I wasn't expecting anything in depth, just some basic story behind it.
3) The injection of political opinion. And the movie was actually pretty racist. I mean black tribes hooting like monkeys? How is that not racist. Regarding the injection of politics - it is just so unnecessary. And it wasn't even accurate either, like taking the stance that black slums exist due to evil white people and how fixing up buildings in these slums is going reduce the percentage of fatherless black families.
Anyway the movie was entertaining and that's mostly all I expect from the Marvel movies. Every now and then a Marvel movie offers a bit more but not this one.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","Marvel's Black Panther origin movie was a given since the character was introduced to MCU audiences in Captain America Civil War, the hype for Black Panther was incredible however the movie didn't deliver. I believe that Chadwick Boseman aka Black Panther half arsed the role, his voice kept changing and he seemed to be rejecting some of the lines he said, he felt like a completely different character from Captain America Civil War. I was rather disappointed with how there were minimal references to the MCU story line which with Avengers Infinity War so close you'd think there would at least be one. Overall the action in the movie was fantastic and exciting just like your typical Marvel movie should be, however the movie was let down by the acting by the protagonist and side characters.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","One of the greatest problems of the film industry is undoubtedly the lack of racial, sexual and gender diversity. This was evident in several recent moments, especially in the awards season when some campaigns appeared as #OscarSoWhite and #PayMeToo.
In this scenario, the world of comics came to the forefront and Marvel released, in 2018, box office and critical success Black Panther.
With an outnumbered black cast, as well as in the technical categories, as costume designer and in the soundtrack, Black Panther, based on Marvel's superhero comic book universe, brings the fight of the new king of Wakanda, a fictional country tucked away on the African continent, T'Challa, played by actor Chadwick Boseman, to protect his people and, of course, Vibranium technology from villain Ulysses Klaue and Killmonger.
The film also stars the Oscar-winning actress Lupita N'yong as the warrior and romantic interest of the king, Nakia. Interpreting Okoye, captain of the Dora Milaje, army of Wakanda, we have the great Danai Gurira, famous for his participation in TV series, The Walking Dead.
In the film, Ulysses tries to invade Wakanda to steal Vibranium technology, for which he relies on the other villain, Killmonger, masterfully interpreted by Michael B. Jordan, actor of Creed.
The theft of Vibranium - which occurs in the past, outside the screens - is a central point of the plot. The consequences of this act modify the lives of T'Challa and Killmonger and shake out Wakanda.
While seeking to defend his kingdom, T'Challa discovers that he is a cousin of Killmonger and this one challenges him to a fight where the throne of Wakanda is at stake. In the face of this, a civil war can destroy Wakanda and there is still time for the family plot of Killmonger and T'Challa.
The film broke down barriers to being nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture, the first film nomination for a superhero movie. And as if that were not enough, he gave the two black women the Oscar for Best Costume Design and Best Art Direction, technical categories never before won by black women. It also took the statuette of the best Original Soundtrack.
Fans of superhero T'Challa await a sequel already confirmed by Marvel. It's more an industry film, but it's a great one. It gave us diversity, equality and excellent action scenes.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","It was mostly good, the action, acting, effects were all great, and the story was... mostly good. And as a history nerd, I love that Black Panther can pique the audiences' interest in the under-studied- but fascinating- African history! 
The story's logic, though, fell short regarding secret-keeping of Wakanda's technology:
-Why didn't they take Killmonger back to Wakanda after his father died? Wouldn't leaving him abandoned make a secret-revealing nemesis out of him? (Also, where's Killmonger's mother? Would she also have known about Wakanda's secret but also left untouched?)
-And the big high-tech action scene in South Korea would've easily exposed Wakanda tech to the world, topped with pedestrians broadcasting the whole thing on social media!
-And the biggest issue is Jabari! For millennia, they distrusted using Wakanda tech, mildly antagonist to Wakanda but ultimately harmless to them, and yet kept in the cover-wall of high-tech Wakanda? Realistically, anytime Jabari would've had a leader or two reveal the ""threatening Wakanda"" to outside neighbors- and knowing the inner workings of Wakanda's defenses- build a coalition to invade, conquer and/or destroy the high tech.

","Review:
After avoiding all of the spoilers, I finally got to watch this movie, which I quite enjoyed but I did think that Infinity War was better. I liked the fact that most of the cast was black, as it is based in Africa, and the way that the director had a lot of powerful women, which you don't see in a majority of superhero movies. The action scenes were also impressive and the cinematography was truly amazing but I did find the Black Panther quite moody and miserable through most of the movie. That's not to say that Chadwick Boseman didn't play the main character well, it's just that it lacked wit, and the storyline could have been a bit more interesting. Anyway, if you have seen Captain America: Civil War, you would have seen T'Challa/Black Panther, sadly losing his father, so in this movie you see him return to Wakanda, to assume the throne. His hometown is isolated from the world, mainly because of its advanced technology, powered by vibranium, During the ceremony, T'Challa is challenged by the Jabari Tribe leader, M'Baku (Winston Duke), who he successfully defeats and becomes king. Meanwhile Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) and Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) steal a Wakandan artefact from a London museum, and Klaue tries to sell it in South Korea but the deal is interrupted by the Black Panther and 2 of his close companions. During the battle, Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman) is badly hurt whilst saving T'Challa's friend, so they take him back to Wakanda, so they can use there technology to save him, even though they don't want to expose there abilities to the outside world. T'Challa then finds out that his father killed his brother to save Wakanda, and he left his nephew in America at a young age. As Klaue knows the secret about the power of vibranium, the Wakanda's have tried to get there hands on him for years but he always seems to slip through there fingers. Erik, who turns out to be the young kid who was left in America, knows that the Wakanda's want Klaue, so he kills him and he uses his dead body to get into Wakanda. After exposing his true identity, he challenges T'Challa to a battle for the throne, which he successfully wins, thinking that he has killed the Black Panther. With Erik in power, he attempts to distribute Wakandan weapons to operatives around the world, not knowing that T'Challa was picked up by fishermen after being thrown into a waterfall. His mother, sister and girlfriend decide to leave Wakanda when Erik took power, and they make there way to the Jabari Tribe to take cover. They then see a badly beaten T'Challa in a coma, so they use some herbs to bring him back to life. Now fully revived, the Black Panther decides to take back Wakanda from Erik, before he distributes the weapons but the tribe are forced to fight for the king, which means that he has to battle against his close friends. Will he claim back his beloved Wakanda or will Erik use his new powers to defeat him! I know that I might have made the plot sound really confusing but it will make sense when you watch it. I did find the leader of the Jabari Tribe, M'Baku, quite funny, and the Black Panthers sister, Shuri, and Nakia were brilliant. Martin Freeman seemed a bit out of place but I understand why he was put into the movie. For a third world country, there technology was unbelievable, and it put Tony Stark to shame, but I honestly don't think that we have seen it's full power yet. Anyway, it's definitely worth a watch and I can understand why there was so much hype surrounding the movie but I personally preferred Ragnarok.

","Although its visuals are top notch, as well as many other elements,Black Panther's script isn't up to the burden of an original superhero tale- and instead, ends up feeling too familiar to reach its full potential. First off i'll start with the films flaws. The film is incredibly predictable, and at times, I honestly couldn't take parts of it seriously. Its fight scenes in the first half of the film are very well executed, but the second half ends up feeling a bit tedious, and truly offering nothing but trying to find its way out of the hole it dug itself. It's disappointing to say the least, not that its bad, but it could have been something so much moe, and instead it just feels too by-the-numbers to truly stand out. As for the positives for the film, it is very visually pleasing to look at. The special effects are incredibly well done, and the costumes are fantastic- as well as the look of the film throughout. All the actors do an excellent job, most obviously Chadwick Boseman in his brilliant performance as King T'Challa and Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger.

","As I reference in the title of this review this isn't your typical run-of-the-mill superhero movie, it truly is a kind of film that makes you think. Usually when I watch a movie I am able to give my thoughts on it pretty quickly but this one took me about a week after I watched the movie to be able to give an idea of what I thought about the film. The story and what takes place within the story which I think has great depth and emotion. I believe it was a genius move to introduce us to the character of Black Panther/T'Challa in the Captain America: Civil War as it allowed in the standalone movie to explore other realms and characters within the world of Wakanda. In Black Panther, the main character Black Panther isn't exactly the center of attention. All of the side characters are given layers and strength giving the film the greatest group of likable characters that I have seen in a film in a while. There isn't one weak or unnecessary character amongst them. The female characters in particular are very strong. Chadwick Boseman's performance as Black Panther/T'Challa is outstanding displaying an African ascent (considering he's American) and carries the film and makes the character his own. The characters of Black Panther/T'Challa is conflicted with family mistakes of the past while tending to the problems at hand. Anytime he gets into his suit; which happens only a few times; makes me excited. The world of Wakanda is the most beautiful world I've seen in a movie since Pandora in Avatar. The film wonderfully explains the world and how it all works making the world feel like a character itself. Michael B. Jordan who is a frequent collaborator of Ryan Coogler portrays the greatest villain in the MCU since Loki. His story turns this superhero film into not just that but also a very tragic Shakespearian-like storyline. A villain that we understand is someone we are supposed to dislike, but you can't help but feel somewhat sorry for Kilmonger. His motivations are completely understandable in why he does what he does. The music in this film is very good as well. All the drums help convey the African world and culture of the people. However, for as much as I love this film I do recognize some errors like all films do. Some people may think this has a very familiar story arc to that of other films. Some of the CGI is very noticeable and is disappointing considering its 2018, not 2003. Some shots are good while others are obviously noticeable. There was one fight scene near the beginning that was hard to make out because of shaky cam. I hate shaky cam and I was worried that this was going to be like this for the remainder of the film, but luckily it didn't, still that one scene was heavily compromised by the shaky cam. Overall, this is a very enjoyable film with beautiful music, characters, performances, and story elements that most of anyone will have fun watching. That is one word I can use to describe this film FUN. If you haven't seen this film yet give a chance and you may end up liking it.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","Spielberg at his best;
I really enjoyed this escape from reality and the homage to so many movies and cultural icons Steven Spielberg has managed to cram into this game within a game movie.
A few weeks ago I reviewed another virtual reality movie a (rom com) Game Night , which I really loathed and thought absolute crap so I was a little sceptical about Ready Player One.
Last Sunday we visited our neighbours very switched on and clever Grandson Callum for his 9th birthday celebration and he was engrossed in his new video game with head set in place and I could see it had captured his imagination and I spotted his Avatar or virtual reality identity in full destroyer battle mode.
I wish now I'd taken up his invitation to join in the game as I've never played a video game but there's always next time.
This experience unknowingly prepared me for this movie in which has cleverly combined real actors , who live in a bleak futuristic 2045 in dismal residential towers called ""The Stacks"".
The occupants of this dark and shattered world escape to the Oasis a virtual realty world where fantasy is the aim and adventure is the game.
Some have said this may be Spielberg 's greatest movie I'm not sure about that sweeping statement but it's up there with ET and Close Encounters.
A terrific youthful cast headed by Tye Sheridan as Parzival, our hero and Olivia Cooke as his capable side kick and romantic interest are the young game players but I was also impressed by the villain Australia 's Ben Mendelsohn as Sorrento and Mark Rylance as Anorak and the inventor of the Oasis James Halliday.
Also loved the music and the fact that what could seem a bleak future Spielberg has transformed into a spectacular colourful world where the human element is most the important component.
It's more about friendship , loyalty and caring for your fellow humans and reality really wins out in the end.

","The first hit of the year. Starting 2018 off in a good way, Black Panther was able to continue the Marvel way, and provide a timely, fun, and thought provoking film. 
 Marvel has proven they will not back down from the current themes in the US. With the tensions and focus on inequality between race and gender building in the past few years, Black Panther has come out on the forefront of the movement, showing how powerful a movie can be, with an almost completely black cast, and a movie that really used women in prominent roles.
 Black Panther took us on a journey into a ""world"" never seen before. Showing us Wakanda, a land that has found itself right in the juxtaposition of modern and advanced civilization, with a very primal and ancestral culture. They played up this juxtaposition and then put it to the test. With the arrival of Michael B. Jordan, as Killmonger, they were forced to ask the question, ""what do we do, when we don't trust our leader?""
 In a culture, where you put your trust in your leader to protect you, this brought them into a new test of ""what does the future look like"" in the advancing times, and the changing atmospheres in both the movie and real life. The movie comes to the climax of moving forward.
 Played marvelously throughout, the cast played off of each other so well, expressing their turmoil in their own, personal ways, they each provided a unique view that drove the tense storyline. 
 This is definitely a movie that will continue the Marvel story line. Even though it really was a standalone movie, Black Panther will be a movie that will be remembered and one that may in the end, help to define 2018 in film.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

The story is good, with some surprises and a balanced mix of action, character development, and humour, but it does drag on at times and has a few holes. The wide range of characters each have their own appeal and show a much more human side to the proceedings, but none really stood out and the villains were disappointing in their simplistic desires. The special effects and fight scenes are great, being fast paced, energetic and not overly destructive, but as with most Marvel movies, the hero is too indestructible and as a consequence, any threat to him never seems real.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","I generally like Marvel movies. They've had a low point recently, with Civil War, which I didn't like, but with Homecoming and Thor: Ragnarok, I really felt like they started to improve and balance their humour and good story well.
Based on the trailer for Black Panther, I did not like the movie from the start. The trailer was awful. Then the ratings came out, and I thought that maybe I was wrong. People called it the next Avatar. But I had a bad feeling walking into the theatre after I realized that all the reviews were talking about were the ""diversity"" of the movie.
And- it turns out I was right. This movie is awful. The story is cliched and forgettable, the characters are standard except that John Watson guy, and it's awfully paced and boring. Nothing stands out. It's been a few months now and nobody is talking about this movie anymore... well, maybe about the black diversity thing, but not the actual movie quality itself. Hmmm. I wonder why. Probably because this movie is **%#%%, and all the critics are scared that they'll be called racist if they don't like it.
I mean, an 88, really? That's just ridiculous. I've always trusted metacritic, but this must be a joke. I want to see all these critics watch this movie again in thirty years and see how much they like it.

The dramatic moments were touching and they are clearly inspired by The Lion King. Unfortunately, the action scenes are very very bad especially with the use of such poor CGI; the characters seemed as they were fully animated in some kind of a computer game. The major issue I have with this movie is the ending; it's so rushed and clichéd. I think the movie should have been separated into two parts because it ends weirdly, I feel that the ending came out of nowhere; it's very displaced.

2076,15 February 2018,Nestion,," The Superhero Movie Every Person Should See
","The truth is this movie is fantastic. It is a film that celebrates some of the most sacred building blocks of community and prosperity. Coogler, who is still fresh off the success of his two brilliant previous films (Fruitvale Station, Creed), returns with his most ambitious and rewarding film yet and I can personally guarantee that despite the obvious success he has ahead of him, this movie will forever be a jewel in Coogler's crown. Black Panther does so much to elevate not just what a superhero movie can be, but what it has the potential to say. Indeed, Black Panther's defining moments are not the action sequences (although they are breathtaking to say the least), but are truly the character moments, especially those that contribute to Black Panther's overall narrative which is to keep moving towards a brighter future, despite the darkness that may lie in the sins of the past. Chadwick Boseman dominates as both T'Challa and Black Panther. He manages to both say so much with an expression, and yet also beautifully put to words the complex struggles he faces over the course of the movie. And in complete honesty, Boseman does carry this movie on his shoulders. Luckily he has a phenomenal circle of deeply engaging and complex characters within his inner circle to lighten that weight. Letitia Wright as Shuri is a particular stand out as her wit and humour is guaranteed to make anyone with a beating heart smile. Danai Gurira is incredible as the ruthless Okoye, and Lupita Nyong'o manages to accomplish such a gorgeous balance of guiding hand and warrior. But, when it comes down to it, this movie would not be what it is without Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger. This is by far the best villain the MCU has ever had (yes even better than Loki). Jordan manages to be both merciless and cold hearted, all while emanating the rage and torture of being a man with nothing to lose, because everything he had has already been taken from him. You will both despise and want more of Killmonger and that is where a good villain should be. Finally, we must discuss the utter magnificence that is Wakanda. Black Panther displays its enthralling African kingdom with so much marvellous detail that it makes you wish it were a real place so you could hop on the next plane there. But beyond it's allure and beauty, Wakanda is a place of culture and tradition. While the movie easily could have skipped past the Wakandan world building, it is clear that those behind the camera were determined to give viewers a taste of a unique culture that also draws on so many ancient African elements, all while effortlessly blending it with colour, technology, and other more futuristic elements. One of my favourite things about this movie is that while it is clearly an MCU movie, it has nothing to do with the MCU besides the involvement of Klaue and the metal Vibranium. So, at no point in this film will you feel as if the movie is trying to build towards some other payoff in a different movie. This is Black Panther's movie and it is solely about his journey and what him and his people are going through. This makes the movie that much more captivating because it immediately allows the viewer to understand that they are watching a great film in general and not just a great MCU film.

(10/10)
This is by far the best Marvel movie ever. Impressively well-acted film. The difference with ""Black Panther"" is that, while observing the outlines of the traditional comic book arc, Coogler and his creative team have enlarged and revitalized it.
Drawing on elements from African history and tribal culture, as well as contemporary and forward-looking flourishes, ""Black Panther"" pulses with color, vibrancy and layered textural beauty, from the beadwork and textiles of spectacular costumes and warm, dazzlingly eye-catching production design to hairstyles, tattoos and scarifications that feel both ancient and novel.
The MCU not only needed this movie, but all of the United States needed this movie. For a superhero movie, ""Black Panther"" exceeds exceptions and is sure to leave its impact of being one of the best in its genre.

The cinematography was spectacular. The film makers blended traditional african clothing and culture with futuristic technology to create a world that seemed both tangible and out of reach. The acting was phenomenal. Chadwick Boseman did an excellent job portraying T'Challa, who is conflicted with his traditional values and what he'd experienced in the rest of the world. Michael B. Jordan definitely stole the show as Erik Killmonger. His superb portrayal of the sympathetic antagonist left audiences with both tears and cheers. Letitia Wright also added some excellent comic relief as T'Challa's younger sister, Shuri. The film score by Ludwig Göransson was perfect. He blended traditional african music with modern day hip-hop to bring both Wakanda and its characters to life. The plot was phenomenal. There were many plot twists that kept the story rolling and the strife between the conflicted T'Challa and determined Killmonger added a lot of depth to the story. The cultural and social references that intertwined with the story related with the audience to make them feel they were part of the story, and that the story was a part of them.

","What is with all the hate for this movie from people who haven't even seen it yet? BLACK PANTHER IS OUTSTANDING!!! This movie is not unique because it's a movie about the first Black superhero ever created, or anything else of racial matters. Rather, tt has qualities that surpass many other Marvel or superhero films and makes a really compelling story with some outstanding qualities in terms of its characters, dialogue, tension, set design, and action .
Perhaps the most outstanding aspect that Black Panther has to offer is it's use and development of characters, and the well written dialogue. Like most other Marvel movies, it has some pretty funny lines, but many of the scenes and dialogue are serious and the tension you feel while watching it is great, even if there's no action going on, because the actors are doing a great job. And every single character is likable and useful to the story and none of them are pointless nor useless (*cough cough*Last Jedi). You really care about all these characters no matter what their ideals or motivations are, and they all fit perfectly in the story with their own set of unique purposes. And this goes especially for the main villain , Killmonger, who has very clear motivations and are developed and told in the story in brilliant fashion. You feel for and understand his struggles and is a much more important and outstanding villain than pretty much any other Marvel villain, who are mostly just disposable and forgettable. My personal favorite is Shuri because she's a very likable character being T'Challa's younger sister with her witty comments and you know how much she loves her brother when she helps him with her technological knowledge and assistance as he goes through his struggles and challenges to become the new King of Wakanda. 
Another aspect of the film that is also outstanding is the action sequences and set design . The set design and color palette are much more improved nd defined than a loth of other Marvel films, and there much to appreciate about the set up of Wakanda and it really feels like it actually exists in the real world. Sure, some of the green screen effects/CGI are kind of noticeable but for me that doesn't really doesn't distract me from how much amazing tension there is in the action sequences. Every fight/battle (especially in the climax) are thrilling and are done so well that it pulls you in to it's majesty. I felt some shivers and shakiness from these action sequences because they are brilliantly directed. 
And one last outstanding topic to cover: this movie does well on it's own and it not forgettable. Sure, it's the movie right before Infinity War and could've been just a set up movie for that .but no, it really stands out as it's own story, and with little to no ties to other Marvel movies and does not waste time setting up Infinity War or anything like that. In fact, you don't really need to watch any other marvel movies prior to this one because Black Panther works on its own as a great, almost game changing experience. Even though it's not perfect and it does kinda feel bland a little bit in the first act, it goes above and beyond towards the second and third act with all of it's action, tension, character development, and dialogue to make probably the most thoughtful and well-written/directed Marvel movies to date. Props to Ryan Coogler, the screenwriters, and all the actors who made Black Panther happen. Wakanda Forever!!!",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","Praised for having an all black cast without having any amazing qualities of its own. This movie could have been and hour and a half if they cut out unimportant garbage like the first chase against Killmonger after he took some vibranium items. The introduction was really confusing and dumb since it wouldn't be explained until a good hour into the movie. The ""death"" of black panther was really stupid since everyone in the audience knew he was alive because we aren't walking Muppets. I'm left with alot of questions throughout the movie.
Why is Killmonger so obsessed with ""freeing"" people he doesn't have any connection with except for a melanin level?
Why didn't black panther chase Killmonger and his crew after their first heist?
Why did Killmonger burn the plants that ensured the lifeline would go on?
There is one thing I really like
And that's Michel b Jordan as Killmonger.
As much as I hate his motives, I think that is kind of intentionally as it shows you how distant he is from any sort of sense. He is however genuinely entertaining and I love most of the things that come out of mouth.

","I have been reading comics since the age of 7 - over 45 years ago - and Black Panther and Luke Cage just happen to be two of my favourite superheroes. 
Back then I didn't know why, but as time went by I looked back and realised that it had a lot to do with the fact that they look like me. 
As a kid, sometimes when I found myself in a sticky situation, I'd get confidence by thinking ""What would T'Challa do""?

","""Black Panther"" was definitely a novel treat, as it broke so many conventions. While not everything it did work, an generous amount of it did and did so in ways I did not expect. The movie definitely has a distinct visual style to present African culture. The cinematography was on-point, delivering vibrant scenery and fully captured the beauty of Wakanda. If I had to single out something that did not work for me, was the CGI. From the badly rendered rhino's to the video-game-like third act, it just didn't connect and at times was blatantly obvious. The performances were strong all-around. Chadwick Boseman got plenty of time to shine, and I was impressed by how much screen-time others, like Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Forest Whitaker, Letitia Wright and Daniel Kaluuya had. Each character had an important role to play, and they did those roles proper justice in my opinion. A pleasant surprise was Martin Freeman as the unassuming CIA Agent Everett Ross. His role was a lot larger than I thought, and his attitude towards superheroes and the Wakandans built a fun rapport that made the story a little more dynamic. Now the villains. I will say this now, Marvel has probably created one of their most fun and most nuanced villain in a while. Andy Serkis's motion capture free Ulysses Klaue was just plain fun to watch as he brought a charming flair rarely seen in other antagonists. Michael B. Jordan was the one I was skeptical about at first, as the trailers did not properly set him up. His moral views and goals where very understandable and it is rare to see a villain so desperate and so rightfully justified in his actions. Even T'Challa was a changed man at the end of it all, which further supports Killmonger's actions. Last but not least, Kendrick Lamar and his curated hit songs may not have gotten a huge spotlight, but with the occasional beats delivered by him, Vince Staples, The Weeknd and others, along with Aftican tribal numbers all but helped add another layer. ""Black Panther"" bucked usual superhero conventions with its cultural insight, villains, atmosphere and strongly-written characters while also remaining very much grounded in the MCU.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

First, the fight scenes for the throne have great visual effects and a great environment, however, those scenes are so over-exposed and take over the scene in my opinion. Our main character is unfun and he doesn't create any meaningful emotional bonds throughout the film. Not only is the main character not funny, but none of the jokes are; zero of the jokes hit. The movie has a really good pace and works well as a movie, but NOT as a superhero movie. As a hero, the Black Panther is one of the least epic heroes of the whole MCU. Because of his distinct lack of crazy abilities the ending cannot put him in any insane situations. Killmonger is a well-acted villain but has a master plan with very little threat. The distribution of weapons, while dangerous, does not hold the same weight as other superhero movies. Most hero movies have a villain who either threatens the lives of millions/billions immediately, or threatens the hero's family/friends.

For a movie spanning 2 hours, RG was able give us fascinating characters with well-written arcs out of huge cast and that's not an easy thing to do. 
We learn about T'Challa's rise as a king, wanting to follow his father's footsteps only to find out that his father made huge mistakes and those mistakes have consequences and T'Challa has to change his entire mindset of what it means to be a king.
Nakia's relationship with her homeland and the outside world. Ross had a totally different mindset of what he thought he knew. Eric Kilmonger is simply one of the best developed villains of the MCU. He made you care about him, even though he went about things the evil way. He killed his girl, just like that. But you understood why he was the way he was. 
Okoye with her principles and strict tradition but her eyes were opened that you cannot blindly defend something that is clearly wrong. Unfortunately, her love, W'Kabi was too blinded by the death of his parents to understand that. Even though he disagreed with T'Challa's method, he straight jumped to Kilmonger's side and I thought it was powerful moment when Okoye confronted him on the battlefield. 
Claw was a surprise, I didn't expect that, but he had his purpose and he made a big impression when he was on screen. When they walked through the metal detectors, that had me laughing cause he didn't give an F, lol.
Not a big fan of FW but hey, loved his role and he had been holding on to that guilt of King T'Chaka killing his own brother and leaving the son behind, a long time. When he sacrificed himself, it was for the best.
The Dora Milaje were just bad ass.
Shuri is that little sister that bugs the hell out of you but she's so cute, you can't help but love her, also she's smart as hell and I would love to see her go up against Tony Stark and bring his cockiness down a few notches. That would be fun to see.

2193,24 May 2018,Saiyan_Prince_Vegeta,," What Africa could have been if they had a civilisation
","It is definitely an action packed movie with an interesting story and a few plot twists. I thought it will be boring to watch it with this ""African"" culture, but in reality it is a mix of African and artificial culture, which kind of shows what African countries could have looked like if they had enough wisdom to create their own cultures like asian or european countries did. So it is interesting to watch this made up country with perfect technology, kind of Atlantida or something. Another reason why it was interesting to watch it was because of MARVEL. Their directors can make even a dumb idea look good, so it was indeed interesting. 
Anyways, it is probably one of the weakest Marvel movies in the recent years, even though the story is quite good, but I don't regret watching it, even though it is not really connected to any other Marvel movies.

2200,17 July 2018,domtaylor,7," Highly entertaining and thematically rich; one of Marvel's best.
","The great characters, action and setting make 'Black Panther' an extremely enjoyable Marvel film and one of the MCU's best. The film is always entertaining, bolstered by an amazing score by Ludwig Göransson that really captures the essence of the flick, and the self-contained story feels refreshing as it's never concerned with setting up further films, only being good in its own right. While the plot is quite predictable, the writing ensures that the audience always care about the characters and are invested in the narrative, leading to one of the more engaging stories of the MCU. The film is also definitely an ensemble piece, and, as good as Chadwick Boseman is in the role of T'Challa, it sometimes feels like the eponymous 'Black Panther' is outshined by the outstanding characters that surround him. That's certainly not a bad thing though, as it means that every major character has their own moment to shine - including T'Challa himself, who gets several of the film's best moments. Although the CGI looks unfinished in some of the action scenes, risking a disconnect between the characters and the audience, the action is always enthralling - a stand out being the entire South Korea sequence - and this is in part due to how invested we are in the story and how much we care about the characters. Overall, 'Black Panther' is an always entertaining superhero flick, with fantastic characters and action, that ranks as one of the MCU's best to date. 8/10",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

In the soil atop the meteor a seemingly magic plant grows that gives those that drink it the power of the mystical Black Panther - protector of the realm.

2237,17 February 2018,dabbymaluenda,9," Much potential, good-enough execution. (Watch movie first).
","I rate Black Panther a solid 9. This is by far the most beautiful movie in Marvel, and the most original. This movie gives you a taste of ""The Lion King"", ""Avatar"", and some black nationalism. When one hears these three combined, you think ""wow!"" or ""how?"". You can tell the planned idea was genius, but the execution could have gone much better. Now I know you've read many reviews about how good this movie is; so my focus on this review is on how this movie had a larger potential, perhaps to be the best movie of the year.
If I was the director and saw the finished product, the evaluation phase, I would immediately contact a film scorer (someone like Han Zimmer), and ask him for some intense music. The Black Panther/King of Wakanda theme was good, the feel for Wakanda's new world was pleasant; however, the most essential, emotional moments were wasted without a doubt. A scene with a script and CGI is a nice square, but a film score brings volume; it creates a cube. If you remember the final Battle in ""Avatar"", you remember the intense music during the final battle. I need that for the final battle between Wakanda & Wakanda. Or if that sets the bar too high, at least add some of the trippy music from the trailer. Or ""La Tentation De Simba"" vibes from ""The Lion King"". I need some suspenseful music, I need a feeling of the end of relationships and the end of Wakanda. This battle was great, but a great background tone would have made it phenomenal. And not just the final battle, some ""Dark Knight"" notes for the interrogation scene perhaps. A huge improvement would've been a father-son relationship theme. Something like Mufasa's theme from ""The Lion King"". The one-on-one challenge fight between the Killmonger and Black Panther should have had a fast-paced score. How about when Black Panther was thrown off the river? Or when he came back to life? Now that is a lot of music for one movie; however, I did say this review is solely to explain Black Panther's potential. A script is the base of the tower, acting and CGI are the construction, music piles up height. Most, not all, scenes in this film should've had something playing externally, because music can fill in emotions actors simply can't.. Those are some ideas to what could've been Black Panther's film score.
Now a problem, believe it or not, that I found was Chadwick Boseman. The star of the show had some questionable acting scenes. My first issue is his acting performance as the son of the King, he really didn't express himself well. Me being a son of a father, realize that father-son relationships affect someone. And he really didn't express emotion towards it. There were many scenes with emotion: hype and action, death, betrayal, anxiety, stress, intellectual, etc. Chadwick Boseman almost felt like he either laughed with his sister, or he had a straight-serious face; in other words, he didn't express much emotion. Now I will give him credit for acting well on the scene where he found out his dad killed his uncle, and when Forrest Whitaker (I couldn't find his character's name) died. But for the rest of the movie I was just finding myself not caring for Black Panther's character, I didn't care for the main hero, the protagonist of the movie. I also have one more comment for Chadwick Boseman, he should've gotten ripped. I need him to look like Captain America in the movie. In his initiation as a king, I was pretty surprised the Black Panther had no calves, he seemed wimpy for a superhero. So if you ask me how this movie could have gone better, I feel Chadwick's performance was a big let-down for the sentiment of the story.
The last thing, literally, to be covered is the final battle. I mentioned the film score that should've been added to the last battle, not the script nor the action. To me the last moments in Wakanda should've gone like how Avatar played on: rise in hype, loss of hope, final 1v1. And in a way the movie played this way, but Avatar's exciting battle also had beautiful creatures and wonderful visual effects. This was a chance to shoot for the stars, and Ryan Coogler missed it. He brought rhinos, but this is Wakanda, I need elephants, lions, panthers (like honestly am I the only one that thought of this), eagles, etc. Bring Africa to life in the last 20 minutes. I assure that would have gone in the books, as the most epic, final showdown. I feel the sky battle between pilots felt like a waste since it wasn't the most amazing thing, it had a cool ending, but it doesn't feel as great if the rest wasn't epic. Like I said before, add some sick music, and show the best of Wakanda that is shown in the comics. And for crying out loud, shoot a scene with Black Panther on top of the rock like in ""The Lion King"" once he wins the battle, with the people of Wakanda praising him. Do it for the fans. I liked the 1v1 at the end, and the falling scene. I enjoyed watching Killmonger against 5 different skilled women. I loved when Black Panther DESTROYED a spaceship with a vibranium spear. I just felt there was space for improvement, to make something competitive to Avatar's final battle. I'm only here to comment on it's potential.
Anyways those are some thoughts on how the movie could have improved. The movie is great as it is, but it almost feels like marvel didn't want it to be the greatest Marvel film. If these 3 elements had been added, no doubt in my mind this movie would have been the best in Marvel, perhaps the best of the year. And simply a revolutionary, example to be, superhero film.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","Black Panther is one of the essential MCU films and superhero films in general. Because of its relevance to the culture of African Americans. That being said, this movie is a bit overrated. The movie may be beautiful with excellent shots but lacks much world-building. We haven't had a chance to feel the cultural side of Wakanda that much. The fight for the crown and technology is exciting but isn't anything new that much. And I feel like the plot should've been more vital, like this movie coming before Infinity War, so the stakes weren't there. Henceforth caused, the film a bit boring. The special effects are mostly excellent, but some scenes are a downgrade. But what was vital was T'Challa, the highlight of the movie.

","I kept wondering how the story about wakanda's super secret city & strength be revealed to the audience. And I couldn't have expected any better, simpler, crispier father-son narrative on why wakanda is the way it is!
Black Panther covers most of Marvel's ingredients, but it feels to have gravely lacked in finding the proportions. There were hardly a couple of scenes that was really funny. Neither the story nor the plot felt fulfilling. Story was weak, didn't cover much but just revolved around the technical advances of Wakanda's super secret city and its rituals. Plot could have been better, didn't have much coverage either. VFX was really good, and that was it.
Killmonger was shown the main villain, but for some reason Klaw seemed a better and audience loving villain who got killed in a jiffy. Killmonger needed a stronger background and story showing him more competitive to the black panther, but it was just his muscles, attitude and an american accent that took more coverage (oh i missed ""Nay"". You'll know what i mean).
 Black Panther is not as much a negative movie as i might have made it sound, but the expectations for various reason were so high, that the movie just failed to meet it.

","While I was watching the movie, I felt somewhat disappointed and uncomfortable. I honestly believe that Black Panther lack respect to the real African people and their culture. And Africa itself is nothing more than a symbol to fulfill the western audiences' curiosity. The settings in the movie are contradictory, and they do not make sense. I cannot imagine with Wakanda as a country with such advanced technology; people still need to win the throne through a savage fistfight. And technically, T'Challa did lose his throne in the combat, and then he revived by eating secret herbs. I think he violates the rules of his own country. But in the movie, he was still depicted as the right one to rule just because he's the decent man and his brother was depicted as a nasty guy.
Besides, there are other logical errors in the film. According to the settings in the movie, T'Challa's sister should be the real ruler of the kingdom since technology is the most potent productive tool there. When his sister controls all the technology, she could easily manipulate the whole Wakanda. The movie is also full of stereotyped images of African people including strange clothes, combat strategies, weird rituals. I'm not saying they are all fake African elements. I'm assuming that these elements are disjointed with modern society and are insipid. Overall, I think if Black Panther should be considered as the victory of the Black people, it's only the victory of the Hollywood Black people.

It's a good movie that raises questions about the concept of a nation and the idea of protectionism, but the story is dull and doesn't really add much. The movie briefly touches on a wide variety of issues and then just kind of leaves them there. And the worst thing about the movie is that, for me, it isn't even really clear who the good guy is. I accept that movies can have ambiguous ideas to make the audience question who the protagonist is, but the thing is, this shouldn't be the case for 99% of types of superhero movies.

","After the events of Captain America: Civil War, Prince T'Challa returns home to be crowned King of Wakanda after the death of his father and must become the king he's waited his whole life to be. When a new foe known as Killmonger emerges from the shadows that has a deeper connection to him than he already knows and wants the throne of Wakanda, King T'Challa must face the sins of his family's past while saving the world from Killmonger's reign of terror. So first off, the CGI in this film was way ahead of it's time, bringing us a nation in the MCU like no other. Chadwick Boseman was born to play King T'Challa and brings us a side of T'Challa we haven't seen until now. Michael B. Jordan is absolutely fantastic as Killmonger, making his villain one of my top three favorites ever in the MCU. Letitia Wright as Shuri was a standout that brings the comedy out when it's needed. Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia and Danai Gurira as Okoye were also great as well as Angela Bassett's Queen Ramonda. Other characters I thought were great additions to the film include Martin Freeman's Everett Ross, Andy Serkis's Klaw, Winston Duke's M'Baku, Forest Whitaker's Zuri and Daniel Kaluuya's W'Kabi. Overall, Ryan Coogler brings us a story with characters unlike anything we've seen until now in the MCU that really shows and explores the world of Wakanda.

","I personally think that different people expected and wanted too many things from this movie that were way to deep and unfortunely they were disappointed and maybe that's why they hated it. I admit they were some flaws and it was rather fast paced for me but I feel that these days everyone is expecting perfection since everything is just constantly changing. The hype made it worse( it felt incredibly weird watching a superhero sci fi movie with the majority of black people instead of you being the only black weirdo) but its fine. The director and actors did there best even though there actors amused me when they struggled with there Xhosa but its fine I could still hear them. Focusing too much on whether the movie showed enough black power and political issues is a emotional strain and turn off . the reality of this world is already bad enough so ruining people's only escape from it is just horrible. But anyway I liked the movie despite everything I understood every character there twists and turns there slightly out of character storyline, and yes I even went and researched there comic book lives and I have to say if Storm shows up in the sequel I hope Nakia kills her cause there a big gaps from the comic and the movie producers !

2313,23 September 2018,linskeyd,3," Would've been better without the ""political commentary""
","To get this out of the way, I review movies based on their quality not their message. And this movie is ungodly average. To get the goods out of the way, suprisingly the villain was alright and had a pretty good story arch and the story overall was entertaning and kept your attention. Now onto the list of bads. First of all, for a marcel movie the CGI sucks. There was not one scene that I saw something in CGI and thought it was real. Somehow the main character, isn't even the most interesting/compelling character in the entire movie. The Black Panther (the character) has no real personality that I could see (Please tell me descriptions of his personality so I can piece that together if possible thanks.). The humor in this movie made my eyes roll to the back of my skull. Black Panther's sister made a ""What are those"" joke and at that time I felt like leavin the thearter and screaming for the next hour.Now a marcel movie isn't made without a good villan right? I mean the villan is fine, but his motives and his plans are so laughably stupid. (SPOILERS PAST THIS PART) The villan Killomonger feels like Africans must get revenge on all Caucasian people because they have been oppressors throughout history, basically he wants to kill all white people using wakandas advanced technology. Okay okay, fort of all, nobody and I mean NOBODY on earth in the MCU would let that happen. Remember the avengers are still a thing, and one black panther knock off vs the avengers(plus other hero's and he'll probably some villains) just seems so idiotic. Plus the villan is an SJW proporganda machine, and it's hilarious.(OKAY MAJOR SPOLIER IN 3 2 1 YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED) When Killomonger dies at the hand of The black Panther he goes to see the sunset over wakanda and it's a pretty cool scene... until Killomonger opened his bloody mouth. He said, and I quote ""Throw my body in the ocean, so I can join my ancestors who jumped off the boat instead of becoming slaves"" and at the part I died laughing so did my two friends and a couple other people. They ruined my favorite shot in the movie with dumb political commentary. The action is meh. Whenever Black Panther is fighting anyone you never feel tension because he is virtually invincible. Not even kidding he took bullets to his head while in his suit and kept running like it was nothing. While on the subject of action the violence was so toned down for that PG-13 rating. At the end of the movie, Killomonger slits a soilders throught, and while there was a close up on her kneck, there wasn't a single drop of blood. It was honestly hilarious. Any ways I can't believe that people were threatened with violence because of their opinion of this movie. There is nothing special about this movie that could change the world or anything like that. The only chievement is that it was the record for the largest grossing movie directed by a black director whic is pretty awesome. The problem with this movie is that could've been something great.

I think the cultural and political messages could have been much stronger and this would have created a far more absorbing and challenging storyline. Some other reviewers expressed disappointment in the fight scenes and poor cgi; this didn't bother me too much, but at times it felt very derivative and a regurgitation of set pieces from other films, and at times became all a bit Lord of the Rings.

","I think black panther is above your average marvel movie. In a sense it exemplifies the cultural existence and relevance of the African culture that hasn't been seen in marvel's previous movies. It feels good to see people of color actually being successful and motivated by honor. Black Panther not only was a hero,but he also helped out his community while staying true to his heritage. Kill-monger was raised without a father, in a sense he had an American way of living that was very similar to the selfishness and self centered american President that we have today. If you are racist at all, you will not like this movie. Why? because the cultural symbolism of the African culture constantly thrives on the Black race being the Superior being in this movie. From the technology to the clothes and style. Black Panther not only symbolizes just a super hero movie, but a culture that was once driven by black heritage but settlers took that land and until now it was forgotten. This movie will be historic, showing the power and strength of Black women. Although Black Panther was gone, his girlfriend stood by his side and saved him from death. The resemblance of stubbornness and strength in a very loyal Black woman. Black love that is. Black women thrived in this movie, being the body guards and fully trusted souls that Black Panther believed in. That not only created the technology for him, but they protected him.

Then came the questions. Like, if your country is in possession of something valuable that allowed you to make extraordinary progress and give your citizens good lives, do you keep it to yourself or do you help others at a risk of losing it all? The movie answers this in a rather naive, simplistic manner. Well, it kind of had to, being a superhero movie. Just as it had to have all those silly fights and rhino robots.

","Black Panther directed by Ryan Coogler is Marvel's latest film, and is marketed as being a unique take on the cinematic universe. And to a certain extent it is, in terms of setting and characters. But ultimately the action set pieces and story structure is basically exactly what we would expect. Black Panther sadly has many issues in my opinion. Firstly the pacing is slow and ultimately boring. The endless expository dialogue cannot be justified as something that is necessary for character development. In fact the characters were my second major issue. Killmonger's revenge story doesn't even pick up until halfway through the film. Yes they gave him a back story, but it's so basic I could describe it all in a sentence. His lack of development made it really hard to care in crucial moments, such as the climatic battle which didn't feel climatic due to the lack of emotional attachment I had to the characters. I never felt an authentic connection to the story because all we are given for our villain were forced emotional flashbacks. Furthermore, for a film with a $200 million budget the level of CGI was pretty unacceptable. It wasn't unbearable, but for the most part every CGI aspect was noticeably CGI. The animated scenery of Wakanda didn't blow me away in the slightest. The comedy in the film was so weak. Every joke was completely out of place. The film seemed scared to let scenes build in intensity. We didn't need a dumb joke about vegetarians to mess up the tone. Another issue was the lack of suspense and anticipation I felt throughout the entire runtime. Any life threatening scene for T'Challa became incredibly dull with zero emotional impact simply because I had just seen him in the Avenger's trailer literally right before the movie started. All in all, Black Panther is a perfectly enjoyable action film and I'm glad so many people felt satisfied by it. The movie presents such important ideas surrounding social justice and racial equality, although putting that aside and looking at the film I was very disappointed.

2390,28 February 2018,amerbajramovic,8," See it for yourself. You might be intrigued.
","The first thing I want to mention right on start is that anyone now wishing to go in cinema and watch it, shouldn't read reviews because I did it and almost quit going. I would make a big mistake. My note is a proof.
I watched it in 2D and that was my second mistake, other then listening to a reviews. Beautiful CGI, amazing fight scenes, lighting... just every visual aspect is a proper 3D material. Totally recommended. 
I saw a lot of comments of how movie was over-hyped and now I wonder, do we now review trailers or movies. If a trailer (which I intentionally didn't watch) is a bit wealthy with scenes, why would everyone go super strict with a movie. Watch it like you never even saw a trailer, I say.
Now the technicalities. Almost everything you would except from a Marvel movie was there. Interesting story, hero that is kinda mythical kinda technological (like fusion of Iron man and Captain America), amazing side characters, beautiful background story which is also beautifully told, landscapes, soundtrack, a touch of humor but not too much like in Ragnarok... ALMOST everything. 
One thing we really lacked was a true villain! A bit of evil, more arrogance, brutality, blood. We lacked a bit of conflict as well. Not a movie conflict because we had a whole lot of fighting but that theatrical conflict between protagonist and antagonist.

Yes it was a little dry at times, yes the characters could have been better defined but these are hardly fatal flaws. I heard someone say it was far fetched....if we're gonna go that route stay away from Marvel all together these are stores about characters with unbelievable abilities that's what they've always been. So anyone who believes it far fetched I ask do you believe in super soldier serum? You really think people get pissed and turn green?? You think Dr Strange really travels the multiverse with magic??? Cmon guys, far fetched is unfair. Also for those who think it far fetched and criticize the believability keep in mind ALL of these story plots had been formulated LONG before these movies. The characters and abilities and origin stories are all taken DIRECTLY from the Marvel books of the past, it's not like someone made this story up last week. Every character and origin story is only telling you what the book said, the specific mission or adventure is fabricated but all characters abilities and origins come from Stan Lee so I don't wanna hear that this story was fantastical nonsense unlike other marvel movies.

","I could easily stop there because basically, there's not much to be said about this movie. But, out of respect for the Marvel franchise, the comics and people who paid to see it, I think that few comments are in place. So, as I said, the movie is very, very, very bad. Everything about it is bad. First of all, it is not a superhero movie which is a little bit strange considering that it is a superhero franchise. The movie is clearly about racial and social issues and that is totally acceptable in some other context but in this situation, it really stands out from the rest of the films and it feels very isolated from the whole franchise. Secondly, these issues were so poorly investigated and presented that it felt like it was a science project by an elementary school student. The acting is quite weak and it seems like the movie was written and directed by an amateur. Also, it was boring. The trailer was far more exciting than the whole movie. CGI was also bad. The relationships between characters felt quite unnatural and forced. 
Black Panther was a great character in Civil War but in this movie, it kinda lost everything that made him relevant. Considering how much hype this movie had, how it was praised that it's going to change the future of Marvel and serve as a culprit of future installments, I was very, very disappointed by it. Everything in the movie looks weak, not developed enough, and it is by far the lowest point of Marvel production. 
The most devastating effect that this movie had (in my opinion) is that I am sure it has ruined the picture of Marvel for most people, especially for those who were not familiar with Marvel before.

All performances are entertaining and urban. I was vexed walking into the theater knowing how racially charged the buzz was over the release of the film. I came to see the Black Panther and Wakanda portrayed on the big screen, not a statement of race. Wakanda just so happens to be centered in Africa so naturally the people of this continent are of different color and man is it Badass.

","Black Panther is one of the decent Marvel movies and I easily give it a 7 but that is a 7 that heavily leans on 6.
I think that the problem is the hype that was around this movie and how among some this title has become untouchable and if you show anything other than enthusiasm you are called some really nasty stuff.
However this film is not bad, or good, it is just decent.
I personally expected much more out of Chadwick Boseman in this film considering his prior films however it is unfortunate to see him almost devoid of all charisma and charm, the main villain Michael B Jordan is just really good in this film and made Chadwick look pretty weak in comparison as an actor, but in reality Michael was not the only one that was considerably more entertaining to watch than Chadwick in Black Panther.
The sound design is pretty good but the script needed more ironing out as it had a fair amount of lazy writing issues.
Another problem in my eyes is the special effects specially the CGI in the movie were pretty low quality in several places.

Through all the expectations to the all the facts after seeing the movie, it all leads to the conclusion that Marvel didn't want to make their tipycal variant of the good ordered blockbuster, but give a chance for something else, so the people could see other new members of the crew of Marvel.
Well, that ended pretty well with the high ratings and box office.
Some people find it great and awesome. Others find it worst movie of Marvel.
I have other opinion. It is good. But it is not great. To make more simple to think it:
The story and all the acting and assembling the whole pieces of the movie producing and filming is all top. But in the final, maybe even in the early too, phase of the making of the movie, seem to be mistakes, which do not blow everything up fortunately. The montage and some of the scenes, were awfully cut or placed. This kinda takes part of the enjoy of the film. And that's what is weird for the Marvel movies.

2432,2 May 2019,CinematicGarbage,5," Wakanda Forever!
","Black Panther (2018), directed by Ryan Coogler and produced by Kevin Fiege, is based on a Marvel Comic character with the same name. I saw many critics love this movie: 97% on Rotten Tomatoes, 88 points in Metacritic and a fair 7.3 from IMDb (I think that's too low, is it?). It also was one of the best MCU movies I've ever seen.
There was Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa/Black Panther, Michael B. Jordan was the main antagonist, Killmonger, Letitia Wright as Shuri, T'Challa's younger sister, Danai Gurira as Okoye, Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia and Winston Duke as M'Baku. They acted good on the movie making the characters unforgettable, usually making funny jokes and I laughed for some time. Killmonger almost topped the greatest villain in the MCU but no, there's a few ones which were better like Thanos, Ultron or even Loki. He's just number 4 on my list. He's pretty badass though and made a better villain than Ulysses Klaue.
The acting suited the plot really well, and the Black Panther comic was well-chosen for the plot of the movie making both audiences and critics love it. Everything was awesome there.
I definately loved the action sequences. They were really EPIC with some Wakandan technology, usually made from Vibranium (especially the Black Panther suit). There were explosions everywhere which made the battle look more like a war. Though I really didn't like one stupid decision done in here, and that is T'Challa's father, T'Chaka's fault for abandoning the child, Killmonger but then I understood without that stupid decision, there wouldn't be a great villain in here and the movie couldn't get any better without that kind of villain. The CGI was definately good. Without CGI, there wouldn't be Wakanda, no vibranium, no high-tech gears and it may be the worst of MCU if they don't have CGI.
One of the best things about Black Panther was the Original Score. Thanks to Ludwig Goransson, we couldn't have a great Black Panther movie without him and he impressively deserved an Oscar for Best Original Score. The soundtrack made us feel about Wakanda, all its technology and the score was also suitable for the movie because of its Africaness (I made up that word Lol).
I would say that Black Panther's highly rated by audiences and critics for its role-credits and movie editings. They worked really hard for the movie and it was nominated for Oscars' Best Picture. In my opinion, Black Panther's one of the greatest MCU movies and it also deserved a high rating from me.

","Marvel seldom puts out bad films and as far as stand-alone features go, this is probably one of the best they have put out in a while. The film does a marvellous job bringing to life the fictional world of Wakandla, having put thought into every little detail and fans of the 'Black Panther' series of comics (which I am) will be thrilled; in ways of set work and art direction, I'll say this is Marvel's golden achievement. Casting is great as well with Chadwick Boseman returning to the screen as the titular 'Black Panther' or King T'Challa, after first being introduced in 2016's 'Captain America: Civil War', Chadwick was born to play this part, bringing heart to his character, facing a constant inner battle between his loyalties to his kingdom and his moral obligations to an outside world less fortunate. Side characters do a great job too, especially Letitia Wright as T'Challa's younger sister, Shuri. The sibling chemistry between these two characters are off the chart and is an actual true highlight of this film, you completely buy them as brother and sister, constantly on each other's cases, but: should anyone else dare... Both the main antagonists in this film do a great job as well, and that was quite refreshing too, as one place Marvel often has fallen short was in creating memorable villains. Michael B. Jordan stars as Erik Killmonger and Andy Serkis (for once not just appearing as a CGI character) as Ulysses Klaue; Jordan plays his character more straight, assassin like, but sells it well, creating sympathy and even some understanding for what we know is a truly evil character, Serkis takes a more comedic approach, basically playing the character as a fat South African who had one too many beers; both characters are completely different and sets two different tones for the film that actually makes the pacing work brilliantly as we switch over from the second to third act. Lastly I just want to make mention of the action as, after all, that is still why many people see these films: the action sequences in this film is great, but actually has it's best moments in the one-on-one battles when T'Challa has to defend his crown in tribal rituals. The fights are intense and beautifully choreographed. Really, there is nothing I can truly fault 'Black Panther' on; even somebody like me, who will openly admit that I have started finding the ever growing super hero genre to have become somewhat trying, will admit that this is about as fresh a film that has come from this genre since the original 'Guardians of the Galaxy' and it is most certainly a film I will happily recommend you go see on the big screen.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","Black Panther is Not Just Another Superhero Flick with the Typical Marvel Formula for its other Solo Movies, Directed By the Amazing Ryan Coogler Who is Known for his Critically Acclaimed Movies ""Fruitvale Station"" And ""Creed.
The Movie Takes place 1 Week After the Events of Civil War,Where T'Challa is mourning his father's death as he takes his rightful place as king of Wakanda, a fictional African nation ""hiding in plain sight"". But Things Shake Up When Movie's Main Erik Killmonger Played By Michael B. Jordan Comes into the Narrative Which Slowly Becomes one of the Best things about the Movie. Erik Killmonger's Motivation And intentions is Much More Deep And Complex Than showed in the trailer. One Of The Best Things About This Movie is how Every character from T'Challa , Killmonger to Other Supporting Characters is Really Well Written.
Coogler Doesn't Shy Away away from Breaking the Normal Superhero Theme Mould And Takes the writing into an Interesting Direction And Wins Another Gold For Marvel, Also the Movie Has Stunning Visuals And Badass Action Sequences.
Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa Or Black Panther is amazing in his Role And His Chemistry With Letitia Wright Who plays his Sister Shuri is a Delight to Watch. Other Actors Like Andy Serkis (Ulysses Klaue), Angela Bassett,Lupita Nyong'o,Danai Gurira,Daniel Kaluuya,Martin Freeman,Florence Kasumba Does Jobs but it's Michael B.

This ties into the fact the outfits were lovely and pretty much like nothing that's seen on the silver screen too much. The whole Pan African inspiration slash futuristic technopunk vibe, I really enjoyed it. I only thought one piece looked back and that was Okoye's (Danai Gurira) wig in the casino scene but given she throws it at an attacking goon I'm sure the bad wig was intentionally. And of course the Panther suit looked really good especially with the lights they gave it to signal how charged it was with kinetic energy, I'm glad they chose purple for T'Challa and gold for Killmonger's suit as those are both royal colors which makes sense for the characters but also breaks they old cliche of Good Guy in Blue and Bad Guy in Red.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

2455,18 May 2018,shanethedane,7," A Decent Movie, but What's All the Buzz About?
","Now I understand that a big reason for this movie's popularity is the fact that it is made up of primarily black people. Now don't get me wrong, I think this is great; in fact I would say it needed to happen. This is something we've never seen in a superhero movie and it was quite refreshing. Erik Killmonger is an excellent antagonist; in my opinion, the best in the MCU (at least until Thanos came around). He was a great opponent to T'Challa physically and emotional due to their very apparent clashing ideologies. The reason I say that is because his motive and his cause is something that is very relate-able to the US today. Many people still feel a sense of racial prejudice and he resembled that pretty well. The only problem is that he was really only in the second half of the movie. The first half was about Andy Serkis character and his whole crusade for vibranium. I think he did pretty well, but he and the Black Panther had no qualities that really resonated well together; I just wasn't interesting in the story for the first half. Then once Killmonger comes back it's a totally different movie with a new plot. Why? Because Ryan Coogler wanted to tell Killmonger's story and he simply had Andy Serkis in the film to keep up continuity after Age of Ultron... Black Panther as a character was very boring and un-compelling to me. The CGI was mediocre at best; there were multiple times where I was taken right out of a scene because I was focusing on the background that was very clearly fake. I also thought the cinematography was questionable, especially during the fight scenes. I am tired of shaky tight shots during big action scenes, which this film has a lot of.

Other than that slight criticism however I rate this as a really enjoyable watch and another great addition to the MCU.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","BP is one of the most disappointing movies I've seen in some time. After stealing the show in Civil War I was hyped for T'Challa's standalone feature. Unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype. The plotting was sloppy, the action scenes uninspired, the CGI frequently dodgy, the humor forced and unfunny (like the M'baka's vegetarian line - dead silence) It felt epic and small at the same time. I wanted to know more about Wakanda, but it was nothing more than window dressing. I wanted some details of their daily lives, but all we see are people milling about in some kind of market place and every African trope you can think of. If a white guy directed this, they'd be calling for his head. It seems as though the only things Cooglar knows about Africa are what he's seen in the Lion King and Coming to America. Even though they're supposed to be super advanced, they have spears and armoured Rhinos! Really? And they determine rule by combat. Seems like intelligence would be more important than physical strength in such a society. There's a guy with the disc in his lip, women with rings on their neck, stuff straight out of National Geographic. If they are a secret society, why even bother with typical African tropes, it could have been anything. 
What I found the most off putting was just how lazy the script was. Many of the subplots were pointless, like the trip to Busan. During the car chase, the women are driving a car made of Vibranium. Bullets do nothing, but Klaw's hand weapon blows it to bits, even though he said vibranium makes his claw look like a pea shooter or something. T'challa drinks some kind of natural steroid during the combat to determine king, but both times he gets his ass kicked. What? The romantic subplot was tacked on and pointless. Vibranium can apparently enable one to do anything. It's supposed to be the strongest metal that can absorb impact but it can also cure wounds, be turned into thread, affect flora, turn tribespeople into experts in all technology, etc.
The plot was just so ridiculously stupid. The bad guy wants to send like five little spaceship things to give vibranium melee weapons to ""war dogs"" all over the world to enslave everyone. I'm not even going to touch on the insane racism of this since it was the villains plan, but how is that even a threat? It would only result in a few terrorist incidents and an eventual war for Wakanda. So dumb. 
Another problem was that we just had Spiderman that featured Ironman, Thor that featured Hulk, and this got...Martin Freeman? Sure they introduced a lot of characters but they were all African Stereotypes and one Mary Sue (Shuri). None of them were very relatable. 
The only thing the movie had going for it was the acting. They did the best with what they were given. Even T'challa was pretty dull. He was the boring boy scout people give Superman shit for. He had way more presence in Civil War, he was a slightly arrogant bad-ass in that. It gave him an edge. Here he's a vanilla boyscout that sometimes ""freezes"" and gets his ass kicked. 
For the record I consider Ironman, Avengers, Winter Soldier, and Ragnorok as best Marvel and Ant-Man, Age of Ultron, Thor 2, Ironman 3 and sadly Black Panther as worst. People shouldn't be celebrating that it merely exists, they should be mad they were given such a lazy, mediocre product. I am.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

The Violence isn't very bad compared to other action movies, there are stabbings throughout though. But most of them are in low detail. Characters do get impaled, but then again it looks fake (Looks like someone took a spear split it in half, and glue the ends between the person with red dyed glue). There are tons of explosions, a few shootings with armed or weak armed people. It is more violent than any other movie from marvel (if we exclude the Rated R ones) from the last 5 years, but it's a great deal. Only a few kissing and make outs and nothing more. Men are shirtless, but for tribal reasons, and never sexual. The action scenes get pretty tense, tight, understanding, shocking and emotional.

","Archie (WhatsApp friend ;)) is very serious about films. Besides Bob, she is my other source of information on the latest movie releases. My movie plans revolve around Archie's seasoned critique. She is the 'recommender of movies', 'maker of plans' and 'booker of tickets' (sometimes gets the theatre wrong but you can't hold that against the Maker) and despite all this, I went ahead and watched the Black Panther even when Archie said that the movie was just average. Could she be wrong? The movie has been setting milestones and is apparently the highest grossing superhero movie.
Though I like the DC comic superheroes better, I prefer watching the Marvel movies. So when Shugz and Hershey asked me if I wanted to watch the movie, I tagged along. 
30 minutes into the movie, I looked at Hershey who looked super engrossed. I waited for 5 more minutes and then hesitatingly asked her if she could understand what was happening. ""Not a clue (or should I say Klaue :D)""she said. 
(NO SPOILERS) Here is the storyline of the movie (I shall refrain from calling it the Plot because the movie lacks one!): The film begins with the 'birth' (figuratively) of the Black Panther and the coming together of the Jabari Tribe to form 'Wakanda'- a nation that portrays itself as a Third World Country to the world, that irrationally refuses foreign aid but is in fact years ahead of its counterparts in technology and refrains from aiding other countries despite having the capacity to do so. 
The source of this technological advancement is Vibranium, a metal available exclusively in Wakanda, that is used in almost everything - fidget spinner like flying saucer, kinetic energy absorbing 'panthersuit', running trains to healing broken vertebrae and turning otherwise gentle rhinos to beasts of war. 
The vibranium falls into the wrong hands, an illegal arms-dealer, Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) and King T'Chaka's brother (Sterling Brown) is accused of having helped him steal it. 
Post T'Chaka's death, his son T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) inherits the throne. He is accompanied by his side-kicks, Okoye (Danai Gurira), the leader of his army of bodyguards and his ex-lover, Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o)
Klaue steals a Wakandan artefact made of Vibranium from a museum with help from Erik Stevens (Michael Jordan) and plans on selling it to a CIA operative, Everett Ross (Martin Freeman). T'Challa along with Okoye and Nakia head to South Korea to extract the Vibranium before it's sold and also bring back Klaue to Wakanda for justice. The plan goes awry with Klaue escaping, only to be killed later by Erik Stevens.
Erik goes to Wakanda with Klaue's corpse and gains the support of a tribe there and defeats T'Challa in the ritualistic fight for the throne. Skipping the why's and the how's as that would reveal the ""plot"" (for lack of a better word), the story follows with attempts made to restore the rightful heir to the throne. 
Here is why I was disappointed with the movie:
1. Did you see Forest Whitaker mentioned in the storyline above? Well, guess what, he's there in the movie. The movie has an ensemble of brilliant actors but unfortunately they either lack sufficient screen time (Brown and Whitaker) or they aren't ideally suited for the characters being portrayed by them (Freeman and Nyong'o).
2. Many may disagree but Boseman hasn't done complete justice to the role of Black Panther. The character just seems so 'ordinary', there are no quirks that set him apart. 
3. The movie is a hotchpotch of plots. The story seems to have been written along the way, in an attempt to include all that is required to make a Blockbuster Superhero film and then some more.
4. While the actor (Jordan) portraying the role of the villain has made a good attempt, the character of the villain itself is not well-etched. All superhero movies need a Super Villain and Eric Stevens is not intimidating enough. 
5. The dialogues lack in creative ingenuity.
The only time the audience hooted was when Stan Lee made his cameo appearance. 
Thankfully I hear it's a non-sequel movie. It goes to show that the makers of the film too didn't have much confidence in it.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

CAST-
The casting, as every other marvel film is just perfect. Chadwick Boseman, who was last seen dawning the black panther outfit in Captain America- Civil war has done justice to the role, and we all loved his performance as king of Wakanda. Micheal Jordon who plays the lead antagonist in the film is rumoured to be the best marvel villain after Loki (and of course excluding the titan Thanos) but I would like to disagree. The role did demand a level of seriousness, but I loved Andy Serkis as Klaw.He did cracked us up with his great coming timing and funny behaviour.Coming to the female lead Nupita Nyong'o, am I the only one or she really looks similar to Jennifer Lawrence?

For a change it had some story and characters you could feel some sympathy with and, for a wonder, fight sequences that weren't just there to make fodder for the spin off video games. Ironically, I found it a bit racist, with its overly 'happy peasants in their wonderful country' vibe. Why should an African culture evolve to still keep peasant farmers and straw huts when every other culture that gets technological advances leaves that behind? Also, just taking spears and other primitive weapons and making them advanced also smacked of racism (they'd be far more likely to just adopt and advance guns) but these little quibbles aside I enjoyed it. I even teared up when the villain died - that NEVER happens in super-hero movies simply because the villain never really has complexity or anything to sympathise with.

Instead, they treat the character seriously, build the jorney and the character's arc convincingly, and made several reflection on contemporary issues. 
Surely there are ""Marvel issues"" remaining. The music repeatedly jumps from unique and interesting style back to lame and formatic orchestra.

King T'Challa isn't even the best character in the movie, even the villain is better; Killmonger is one of the best, if not the best, villain of all the MCU.
My personal favorite is Shuri, T'Challa's little sister. She represents so much: intellect, cunning, humor and woman power. She is a young lady who commands all the technological side of Wakanda, she brings innovation and modernism into all she does. She is fearless and doesn't mind standing up for her opinions. Her style and personality is fun and young, she is all a young girl should aspire to be. She's a model.
Aside from her, all the others female and male characters bring their own thing to make this movie a masterpiece.
The artistic side of the movie deserves an applause, the costumes, the dances, the architecture of Wakanda, all was so beautiful and reminding of African style with just a touch of futurism. All pure Wakanda style. I wouldn't mind having a dressing like T'Challa's. Especially those old school sandals (WHAT ARE THOSE???).

2566,6 June 2018,losermcgee,8," Phenomenal superhero film is groundbreaking with diverse cast and excellent themes
","I'm going to start this review off by saying this is one of the best superhero films I have seen in my life. The themes and characters are beyond what we have seen in a recent superhero film. One of the films strongest points is its visuals which are more creative and unique than any Marvel film to date. The clear ingenuity of the crew working on this movie is present in every visually stunning scene, which is practically every scene. This is by far the most beautifully shot Marvel movie to date. Wakanda itself is a visual masterpiece and it only gets better from there. If had to complain about one thing, it would have to be the action scenes, which are good, just a bit average, which makes it seem a lot worse, when everything in this movie is incredible otherwise. Perhaps the best part of Black Panther: the characters. The best part about the characters is their diversity dn excellent representation of a black cast and female leads. T'Challa himself is a sort of bland character. He more or less feels like the typical kind of average lead in a superhero movie, despite excellent acting from Boseman. Similar to T'Challa, Everett Ross is one of the few things keeping this movie from a 10 star rating. He is just a typical white guy stuck in a foreign nation with no clue what to do. Once again, martin Freeman has a great performance, but the problem lies in the character and the fact he really doesn't improve the movie at all. It ends up being Killmonger who steals the show the most, presenting an excellent villain, with a great backstory and very strong acting. He is everything you need in a villain. He is badass, as the scene after the museum heist proves. He is an excellent foe to challenge the protagonist and his goals are understandable. That may not sound like a necessity for a good villain, but trust me, it is. The fact that you are able to see where the villain is coming from helps you understand his character and the fact that he is doing this for the mistake of a previous Black Panther. Klawe is also a great villain, mostly because of Andy Serkis' stellar performance. He doesn't really do much, but he has some great humor and that acting is so perfect. Also, I have never seen a movie handle its female characters as well as this film. Gone are damsels in distress or females who are there to be love interests and nothing else. All of the females in this movie are badass, unique characters. I would especially like to highlight Shuri, who is a character that proves a very young, black, female can be incredibly smart and still be amazing at combat. Shuri is an excellent character, a character most films in general have failed to create as compelling a character. Okoye proves hardass bodyguards don't have to be buff men in tuxes, and Nakia proves that females can actually be the ones to save the day and be the one who has the correct plan for the nation, rather than a simple love interest. In conclusion, this film has some of most well-characterized, original, likable and compelling characters in a movie ever. Another excellent character, this one something of a surprise is M'Baku. M'Baku ends up being a fun, badass, excellent character who doesn't have a huge role but Winston Duke uses his screen time to create an extremely compelling character. Something to go with that same concept is the story of family. T'CHalla might be boring character but he is part of a brilliant family blood relatives or not, that will stop at nothing to save him. It is possibly the best part of the film, when the story focuses on that group of people who has not yet given up on T'Challa. Yet another amazing thing about this film is the politics involved with it. The theme, message, and resolution of the story of Wakanda, and yes the nation does have a story, is a very good, wonderfully thought story. This film captures racial politics unlike any film I have recently seen. In an industry that finally supports fins revolving around a mainly black cast and the story of how black people fit into the world around them, I am glad to see this film made. The themes of Wakanda standing alone and the themes involving the other countries of the world are all amazing themes that will leave you thinking about this film's real-life significance even after it is over. Not since Get Out has a movie done that to me. Lastly, the story in this film is incredibly compelling. All the scenes will have the audience drawn in. You will be at the edge of your seat, caring for all the main characters, hoping that Killmonger is defeated. This is one of the few recent movies that captured my interest all the way through, and not only did it do that, it also used an excellent diverse cast to play amazing character, wonderfully shot scenes and amazing themes.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

I think Black Panther could have more powers because he is a Super Hero who has gained his strength from the past. Wakanda seems to be portrayed as a safe place for fighting Thanos in Avengers. I also believed that there exists a place called Wakanda after watching the movie. However, if there were any sequels to Black Panther, i would not be much interested. The story was predictable and i watched the movie once for the graphics and to know what superpowers Black Panther could have.

It won't go down as the best CGI manipulated movie or best action sequence, not even greatest acting in the Marvel jaggernaut. However what this movie has done that the others have failed is to lend a cultural vibrance and a sense of belonging, especially to Africans in our homeland (I'm from Kenya), and to see the greatness of our continent if it's resources were harnessed and used well. Yes it has political undertones, anti-colonial sentiment which of course triggers the race debate (which is where I suspect many reviewers got salty), but that's the point of BP. Of you read about his character as well from the comic books, he isn't a ""fit"" in the Avengers and has always been suspicious of the rest, as his first priority is protecting Wakanda.

2656,27 August 2018,decima1870,10," A truly enduring epic
","This is definitely one of the greatest Marvel films by far with an engaging plot, a compelling villain and an important message. Black Panther's monumental success at the box office is certainly evidence that this film crosses many boundaries and touches people in a fundamental way. While the film delivers the expected action, moments and humor seen in all the Marvel movies it also speaks to historic problems in the United States and the world. Certainly the race and poverty message is a poignant one and resonates with not only African Americans but also any historically exploited or oppressed people.
It is interesting to note how some Caucasian Americans have reacted to Black Panther over some other Marvel films. Some white people that I have encountered (especially the overly-sensitive Trump supporters) seem to be insulted by the racial overtones of this film and cannot possible separate those notions from the rest of the film's quality. It is important to note that among the prior criticisms here on IMDB you will see many ""I'm not racist but"" comments or at least claims at not noticing the race of the actors. As we see in the age of dog whistles to white supremacists these claims are typical of such people. 
It is very sad to be living in a time when people cannot separate their own political biases from judging quality artwork. Black Panther is an exemplary piece of entertainment just like most of the Marvel movie franchise entries and no doubt that the inclusion of an almost all African American cast made the film more attractive to a worldwide audience. It is obvious that some weak minded viewers simply cannot stand it when minorities gain great success weather it is in attaining the highest office in America or making block buster films. In the end, the overwhelming evidence by multiple sources prove Black Panther to be a great movie but it's detractors who are racially motivated really aren't interested in truth backed by objectivity; they only want to see their own frailty supported by hate filled opinion.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

2677,19 May 2018,werlingjakob,10," Black Panther is the Best Movie That the MCU has Made So Far and is a Superhero Movie for the Ages!
","Let's face it, the MCU is a very very successfull film franchise. For ten years, the have been cranking out movie to movie and each one is usually either great or very good and has made either a lot or a decent amount of money at the box office. But Black Panther: is something completely different. And it is a good type of different. For starters, the story is great: It blends together an amazing tale of both revenge, wonder, and a man struggling to do what is right. The story of Black Panther is also able to explore a more important idea than other superhero movies as well and also is able to explore lots of different complex but smaller ideas, like ""how can a good man be a great ruler but also be a murderer"" and ""why does a country that can solve all of the world's problems keep itself hidden from the world?"" The story is also able to explore lots of social issues (mostly race- related) and has an amazing twist that keeps the entire movie going and keeps it from getting boring. Chadwick Boseman does an amazing job of portraying the main character of T'Challa/Black Panther, he makes the character both diverse/witty/cool/serious/realistic all at the same time. Michael B. Jordan also does an equally-amazing job of portraying the movie's main villain-Erik Killmonger. He is both tough and soft, has a great backstory, and is very intimidating without having any superpowers. And at some points in the story, you will probably find yourself rooting for him as well. The supporting actors and actresses also do a great job too: Lupita Nyong'o portrays the character of Nakia with excellence giving her character a badass aura that needs to be seen on more female characters in popular film franchises. Danai Gurira does the exact same thing for her character of Okoye, and in turn she becomes a more deadly more fiercer female type of stormtrooper that could actually kill Luke Skywalker before he kills her. Letitia Wright gets first prize as funniest character though, in her breakout performance as Shuri: T'Challa's smart and witty inventor sister. And Daniel Kaluuya, Winston Duke, Sterling K. Brown, Angela Basset, Forest Whitaker, and Andy Serkis all do great jobs acting as W'Kabi, M'Baku, N'Jobu, Ramona, Zuri, and Ulysses Klaue. The only problem with the acting is Martin Freeman. What is he doing here? And why is he playing a lead character? It is just a little random, that's all. The action sequences are also amazing and expertly-executed. They look a lot like the action sequences in The Matrix with all of the slo-mo and detail. The movie's soundtrack is great as well. It combines both traditional African folk music, modern hip-hop and R&B, classical orchestra, and breezy pop. Ryan Coogler does a great job of directing the movie and, of course, the special effects and fast humor are top-notch. As well as the character development. And sure, Black Panther has its occasional problems (such as a constantly-occurring plot point and a sort of lacking final showdown between Panther and Killmonger). But all of the problems are really small and in the end, we are left with an amazing masterpiece of a blockbuster that will most likely transcend generations.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","Marvel... Thank you yet again for another fantastic addition to the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe). Black Panther is a beautifully done super hero movie that's different from the rest. And different has the potential to be a good thing and that's what transpired here with this film. Ryan Coogler (Director) gives viewers the perfect feel and vibe of the culture and atmosphere of Wakanda to quickly engage us. All that combined with the terrific acting all across the cast and the brilliant action sequences, good plot and raw emotion all go together perfectly as we dive deep into the beautiful world of Wakanda. i plan on seeing this movie again, one of the best movies Marvel has to offer",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018
2696,2 March 2018,themachine-06512,7," c+ effort, but was it worth the hype?
","First of all i think i am obligated to say that this is not a race thing to me. i like the fact that we have a new black superhero movie, after years of neglect. but i don't think that fact should affect my opinion, because when it comes down to it, its really just another marvel movie. and just because it isn't whiter than a yeti in a snowstorm doesn't mean its worth a 100%, or even a 90%
with that out of the way, here is what i liked and didn't like
overall i mostly enjoyed the cast. they played the roles fine, although looking back it wasn't too above average. they acted fine, had alright chemistry, and overall i didn't mind.
the plot, i thought, was pretty good. i liked what they did with the villain, and although they could of done more with the panther, i thought the way they worked the plot was alright.
the action was also fine, could have been better, but it did its job of entertaining, and was really one of the better parts of the film.
finally, i really liked the visuals. wakanda looks pretty cool, the characters are well designed, and overall i don't really have many complaints. you COULD say it looks a bit generic, but it didn't phase me.
overall the main flaw of the movie is that it wasn't very memorable. if this film didn't have a mainly black cast, then there would be nothing that makes it stand out. there are parts that i like, like (and i hate to say this) some of the political takes were interesting. and i don't mean ""yadda yadda have black people in movies more"", thats kinda a given. what interested me was the take on bias and racism. because not only do the white characters have their bias beliefs (the fbi guy treats wakanda as pretty lesser until learns of its power), but so do the black characters. one of them calls the fbi guy a ""colonizer""(which is fair enough, but its still kinda racist), the villain hates all white people and wants to colonize THEM, the entire movie seems to have the message that hatred can come from anywhere and anyone, and instead of fighting each other over our differences and conflicts, we should band together and try to find a common ground, that will hopefully strengthen us both.
but other than that, i can't really say the movie left an impact on me. it was okay, maybe in the 75-77% range, definitely slightly above average, but nothing too special. overall its just yet another overhyped marvel movie.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","I almost love the film, The Black Panther. It's visuals are stunning, the CGI is wonderful, the cinematography is sumptuous, and the acting is really good...and then there's Michael B. Jordan. 
To say I was disappointed with his acting is a vast understatement. I get that he's supposed to be angry, vindictive, etc. But Jordan's interpretation of his character was like watching some bad '70's black revenge flick. It was all about being from the hood, and the whole 'we're an oppressed people' attitude that really sinks Jordan's acting and the reasoning for his taking the throne. 
For a character who is supposed to be so educated, so highly trained, he only came across as an angry man who is only out for revenge. Add in the ridiculous and incongruous fact that, despite all his anger throughout the film, he suddenly reverts to a contemplative man who says he always wanted to see the beautiful Wakandan sunsets his dad had spoken of years previously as he sat dying near the films' conclusion.
Such a change in a character is either terrible acting, bad scriptwriting, bad directing or editing, or a combination of all three. Jordan is a decent actor, but his performance in the Black Panther is just terrible and completely detracts from the film as a whole. Too bad.

But the main problem is that this is meant to be an origin story but it really doesn't feel like it, we still don't know a lot about Black Panther and HOW he got his suit. 
I still don't feel like all of the hype is justified, but it's not as bad as Thor: The Dark World. 
The villain is not as good as people say he is, he is not that intimidating which most of the GOOD Marvel villains are. Loki was threatening and funny, he was not. 
It feels like your average Marvel movie, and that's ok! 
If you like Marvel, watch it. You'll like it. 
But don't be close minded enough to think that this is good just because it has black people in a non-racist way.

","Admittedly I wasn't able to see this film on opening weekend, yet that didn't matter at all because everyone else did. The movie grossed over 200 million dollars on it's opening weekend, becoming only the fifth movie in history to do so. But is the movie really worth all the high praise? A 97% on Rotten Tomatoes and an 88 on Metacritic? Well the movie is not perfect at all but it is absolutely worth the price of admission. First of all the acting is not 100% solid, Chadwick Boseman is good but a bit bland and uninspired in the leading role. The rest of the supporting cast is serviceable but the standouts by far are Letitia Wright (Shuri), Andy Serkis (Klaue) and Michael B. Jordan (Killmonger). These performances are dynamic, electric and charismatic and are truly the best parts of the film. Michael B. Jordan gives us the most charismatic performance any MCU has ever had while delivering the most memorable and complex Marvel villain to date. I'ts a shame that he's only in about 20 minutes of the actual movie since he is one if not the best part of the film. The visual color palette in this film is amazing and yes I am talking about a Marvel film (lol). The film's cinematography and color is very pleasing to the eyes as Marvel has taken the complaints of their previous films to heart. Ryan Coogler, the director, did a great job with this film and continues to impress me at such a young age. By 31 he's already wowed me with his meticulous direction in Fruitvale Station, he's inspired me to actually get off my couch for once with Creed and now has delivered a really fun MCU film. However not all is sunshine in Wakanda as the visual effects leave much to be desired. For a Marvel flick with a budget of 200 million dollars some of the effects are plainly put, unacceptable. The uncanny valley is way too noticeable on several times during the run-time this unfortunately breaks the level of immersion and enjoyment. No spoilers, but there is a scene during the third act of the film in which I just lost it. The effects were so laughably bad, during the scene, that I just couldn't maintain my composure. I was put under the scrutiny of the whole theater as they turned towards me to try and comprehend why somebody would laugh at the climax of a film. This reaction makes me think that most people won't have a problem with the CGI this time around. Although in reality the scene looks as if it was a video game cut-scene taken right out of the Playstation 2. Regardless I think this film is worth a watch just don't expect to walk into the 12 Angry Men or the Citizen Kane of Marvel films. Curb your expectations and be ready for a flawed yet awesome good time at the cinema.

2773,3 June 2019,l-53204,9," A Marvelous Edition To The Cinematic Universe
","The historic, first of its kind, box office smash, Black Panther, has kept superhero fans at the edge of their seat; with excitement and it is safe to say, it did not disappoint. The 135-minute action-packed masterpiece directed by Ryan Coogler, featured an unparalleled cast led by Chadwick Boseman as the Black Panther, and Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger, along with many other actors who all played a part to set the bar high for what next in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
The Black Panther was nothing short of perfection. The movie is based on the Black Panther comic series, created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1966. The comic book hero was first introduced to the cinematic universe in 2016, during the movie Captain America: Civil War. The Black Panther movie is based in the fictional country of Wakanda located in Sub-Saharan Africa. The country of Wakanda has been seen throughout the Marvel universe prior to the release of the film most famously in Iron Man 2. The combination of MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) easter eggs and a first-ever black lead cast for a Marvel film, lead to high excitement for superhero fans, and it is safe to say, they were not disappointed.
The movie follows the cookie cutter plot sequence of virtually every Marvel movie with the Black Panther as the protagonist, and possibly the most power-driven and cold killing villain Erik Killmonger as the antagonist. Even with a similar plotline to the rest of the MCU, the Black Panther brings forth a interesting change that makes the movie worth watching.
The movie was packed with mind blowing and clean cut CGI effects that helped drive the futuristic and luxury aspects of Wakanda. These effects were most noticeable as the Wakandan airship flew directly into the sub-saharan tree line and straight into the beautiful city of Wakanda.
The Black Panther features an Oscar award-winning soundtrack that radiates a futuristic yet traditional African sound. The score features many influential figures in the rap scene such as Kendrick Lamar and Travis Scott. Songs like Opps with Vince Staples and Yugen Blakrok, bring out the otherwise hidden emotions in certain shots of the film. This is seen through the intense and fast pace feeling brought out in the car chase scene that takes place in the neon-lit streets of South Korea. Other scenes such as the battle between Killmonger and T'Challa or the resurrection of the Black Panther, will leave you with tears in your eyes and a broken heart. The young and talented director did an unbelievable job illustrating world problems such as poverty and social injustice, through fictional events in Wakanda.
The movie was eye-opening to many and is definitely something everyone should see in their lifetime. After seeing the film it is clear there is room for a sequel and countless opportunities for the hero to appear throughout the MCU. The Black Panther is a superhero movie for the ages that will have a hulk-like impact on the cinema universe and an even bigger impact on black culture in cinema.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

I can't lie, Killmonger made this movie for me from beginning to end. I loved everything about his character, his ambitions, everything he did to achieve what he wanted, it makes you question if he was truly the villain, no? Truly one can feel empathy with such a great antagonist. The CGI wasn't that great honestly, it was either averagely passable or poor. As well as I noticed that for every confirmed kill there wasn't a single drop of blood spilled from the character, and if there was there wasn't as much as it's supposed to, noticeably one kill that Killmonger does where he slices the neck of a character and nothing comes out of her neck, it kept disturbing me.

2806,18 February 2018,mcdowellac,10," Black Panther Review
","Spoliers ahead
First, let me say I did go into this film with very high expectations because of the hype surrounding the film, as well as the nature of what the film represented to a group of people. Most of all, because I'm a avid collector of comics books and black panther happens to be one those series that I collect. In general it is very hard for me to sit through a film adaption of a comic book and look at it from a objective point of view. I always find myself wanting to compare it to the source material, and normally I end up disappointed-not because the film is bad per se, but because it doesn't live up to my expectations. 
There have been very few films that have been point on that I've loved. Deadpool, Kickass, the Watchmen, and even though Logan wasn't the version of old man Logan I would of loved to see on the big screen, I loved that film as well. I could even appreciate some aspects of Christopher Nolan's version of Batman. But we're not here to talk about those films, this is about Black Panther. 
The film follows T'Challa as he steps into his role as king (I'll try hard not to put too many spoilers or story material in here for those who are still going to see it). The events of this film follow after Captain America civil war. T'Challa is back in his country Wakanda, fictional African nation that is described as the most technologically advanced place in the world. This is due to a very valuable and rare metal called vibranium. T'Challa's goal is to ensure that his people are safe and by doing this, he sets to continue to keep Wakanda a secret. T'Challa believes if the world knew how advanced Wakanda was and knew that they were storing the virabium then his people would surely be attacked by outsiders. 
Now, the villain of the film, Killmonger, who I won't go into specific detail about, is the opposite of T'Challa. He is a black militant. Actually, I'll even dare to say that he holds true to the real black panthers' (from the 1960's) way of thinking. Killmonger wants to not only take over Wakanda but he wants to use its advanced resources to do what others have done to his people. Colonize. He believes that the they should use Wakanda's technology to arm their people around to world to overthrow their oppressors and take over every other country. 
The story more or less revolves around this conflict of thinking. And while watching it I couldn't help but to think of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcom x. As well as Professor Xavier and Magneto whose ways of thinking we're based on the aforementioned. One wanted to take over the world or overthrow those who oppressed them/hated them. While the other sought to co-exist with those who were different from them-to show them over time that they were the same.
This is the stance the story pretty much takes and in the end, T'Challa agrees with Killmonger to an extent. Instead of taking over the world he wants to extend his resources by educating and building up black communities around the world. There are a lot of political elements thrown into the film that brush upon current issues. Past issues and reoccurring issues. And the director does an excellent job of building this into the film while making it entertaining for anyone to be able to enjoy. 
He also does a great job of showcasing black panther in a positive light. A hero who has his faults and fails at times but finds a way to overcome his doubts and weaknesses. He beautifully melds aspects of African culture into a fictional universe as well as properly represents the background characters as not just warriors, but also elegant and intelligent people. I think all of these things are not only true to the source material, but also important for other African Americans, especially those of a young age,
to see. It gives them something to be proud of. It gives them characters they can not only relate to, but look up to and strive to be like the powerful intelligent people that those actors were portraying. 
There were some minor things about the film that I thought could of been touched up on like the fighting, which I thought was a tad choppy at times especially towards the climax. And the cgi I felt could of been a little better especially towards the end when Black Panther and T'Challa was fighting. I also couldn't help but to think of he lion king at times during the film but again those were minor things to a film that I thought lived up to the hype it created. 
The movie was easy to follow even for someone who has not watched captain America civil war or read any of the Black Panther comic books. The plot was engaging and informing, and the people and culture were beautiful to watch on the big screen. There was a great mixture of action and comedy, as well as drama. In the end, it's a Marvel film, but definitely one of the better ones in my opinion. I would definitely recommend it.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

I understand this movie is really political in the USA, but I don't really get why this is a black movie, and something for black people to be proud of. The movie is a thin fairytale in the fictitious African kingdom of Wakwanda, so not that weird the cast is African (looking). One of the messages in the film was that Africa was robbed empty by others. There's truth in that and nothing wrong with it being told once in a while. But on the other hand, this can be said about every continent on earth. the last centuries the westerners are the evil do-ers, for example I'm Dutch and the slave trade of the Western Indian Company was repulsive. But before the 17th century western Europe was peripheral, where was plundering and a place where people were made slave and taken away. What I want to say is, I don't really get this playing politics of Hollywood. I find it most of the time quite pretentious, embarrassing, arbitrary and mark missing. Concerning this particular movie, to me it wasn't that (bothering) political. This movie made me think of Avatar, the nice visuals and also somewhat story wise.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

2862,22 January 2019,htestroete,9," The best MCU movie to date
","Black Panther not only works as a superhero movie, but also as a commentary on the current state of the world. Black Panther is able to do almost everything right, with only some of the CGI being not on par with the rest of the film, but other than that the movie is near flawless. Chadwick Boseman returns to the character of T'challa for the first time since Civil War and he builds upon his great performance there to put in another one here. But for me, as great as Chadwick Boseman is, Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger is the best character in a movie filled with great characters. Jordan is able to play Killmonger with ease, and in my opioion is tied with Thanos for the best villian in the MCU to date, and is able to turn in a performance that is on par with the likes of Heath Ledgar as Joker in The Dark Knight. All of the side characters are able to add onto the already amazing quality of this movie, with Ulysses Klaw being particularly great. Andy Serkis plays the character for the second time after first playing him in Age of Ultron, and is able to add a sense of humor and grittiness to the character which makes him one of the most enjoyable to watch, even if his tenure is short lived. Another great part of this movie is the score, with each piece being able to convey the desired emotion of the scene, with the Killmonger theme in particular being outstanding, the tune really being to show how intimidating Killmonger really is. Wakanda is one of the most beautiful locations ever seen on screen, and the movie is able to really sell you on the hidden country. Another great thing about this movie is the astral plane sequence, which is drawing obvious inspiration from gen Lion King, which is actually drawn on a lot in this movie, which is not at all a bad thing. In conclusion, Black Panther is an amazing movie with great characters, setting, score, and story, which allow it to become one of my favorite films of all time, and the best the MCU has to offer.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","Overall, this movie was a good movie. It had a good plot, good story, and very likable and great characters. Is it overrated by the PC critics? I believe it is over-rated and that movies like Dark Knight are far superior. However, this movie had great CGI, interesting and historically archetype characters, and a great morality as well.
Wakanda was done very well and the fantasy city was beautiful. The characters and the ark of the story was very good (although relatively simple). It did remind me slightly of Lion King and that is a good thing. I love the contrast between the two major characters and their morality that is displayed. One has a negative upbringing and chooses the evil route, and one has a privileged upbringing and has more moral decency. I found myself rooting for the character with proper morality and how he displayed his belief in right and wrong even if he had to go against his own family.
The one thing I noticed regarding the reviews is just as some reviewers are complaining because the critics over hype of the movie, I can say that the amount of 1 star reviews are the reverse side of the perversion. On one side, the critics want to drool over the movie for political correctness, and others want to hate the movie without actually rationally considering the movie. I find it hard to believe that this movie would have garnered so many negative reviews if not for the publicity and political hype that has ended up surrounding this movie.

It made me think that they were mixing it up with the Tesseract, which was an energy source. In Blank Panther, somehow the metal itself somehow gave them technology. Other than this movie, it's only know previous property has been it's toughness and it's ability to rebound energy (part of it's toughness) , not somehow store it for use at a later time. When Thor's Hammer hit the Cap's shield in t he original Avengers, it bounced all that energy back to Thor, it didn't supercharge his shield for use at a later time of his choosing.

The director Ryan Coogler (Creed, Fruitvale Station), along with actor Chadwick Boseman, black panther movie is in their hands to expand the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the spiritual sequel to Captain America: Civil War (2015) and find the mysterious Wakanda.
Black superheroes were never afforded the same deification. During the tail end of black cinema's golden age, Wesley Snipes' early-aughts Blade trilogy flirted with pop immortality, but even that character's legend faded across the years. I sometimes wondered, and still do, if black superheroes were ever meant to endure in the mainstream, the truth of America being what it is, or if the recurring image of black valor was too much of an irritant to the illusion Hollywood needed to project, to protect.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

Jordan was SO good as Kilmonger and by the end of the movie you really do sympathize with him (just as you did with Loki) Really loved Leticia's Shrui and Duke's Baku, both brought the classic Marvel humor.

Growing up watching Disney princess movies, I would always play Jasmine since she looked the most like me (I'm still growing up) but its so important for kids to see heroes who look like them.

However there are many problems that for some could bring this movies rating down to a 6 or even 5 out of 10. These include a lack of suspense. There is a point in the movie where you really will feel that there is zero risk for the good guys to lose.

","I found this a solid movie really enjoyed it but it some flaws. The story was thin it was pretty predictable like thr scene where killmonger throws black panther from the waterfall he could have easilly stabbed him to death but by throwing him of the waterfall they could make him land good so he could survive. but its a superhero movie so one of the main reasons i go and see them is for their action. Its not every scene in the movie is predictable though, take the moment when the first villain dies. If you hadn't seen any trailers and are new to this hero this would come as a big surprise i really liked that. The cgi was not that great but al those people said that it sucked are just searching for flaws because it was good most of the time, in the final fight the cgi was a bit hindering for me but in the rest of the movie didn't bother me at all. i get that a movie about an african civilization should have african people but why are they wearing acient clothes? I don't get that but maybe thats only bothering me. Also one scene was one of the most racist scenes i have ever seen in a modern movie why are they making monkey noises when the cia agent starts speaking i don't know if it is racist to white people or racist to black people but i think its racist. I don't like all the pollitcal influence around the movie it doesn't have anything to do with the movie it self so i don't give this any influence to the grade but why do people give this movie praise for being with only black actors it shouldn't make a difference if a movie is played by a white guy/woman or by a black guy/women. I don't think you can grade a movie on the political corectness take a movie like wonderwoman this movie gets compared to black panther although they have a completelly different story but why do they get compared because they stand out in their politcal influence the one is about woman and their opression and the other one about black people and their opression in pollitcal terms. why should you compare a movie because of that i don't get it and i think its wrong.

","The MCU has made some films I would describe as truly fantastic, such as Thor: Ragnarok, Doctor Strange, and Iron Man 3. Black Panther by contrast was an fun movie, not a masterful piece or arts, but a mostly fun movie. Killmonger is one of the superior villains in the MCU because of the well fleshed out nature of his characters, properly established motivations, and a kick ass and sympathetic performance from Michael B Jordan. The protagonist however is simply a dull character who you simply aren't invested in, simply because of the high benchmark set forth by the MCU pertaining to protagonists.
The movie does NOT have a deep message, infact like Captain America: Civil War It masquerades itself as a deep movie by creating a moral dilemma, and then executing it in the most generic and unintriguing way possible. If you come to find enjoyment in Black panther through substance you will be disappointed. If you come for fun action sequences, some nicely done drama, and an enjoyable cinematic experience, Black Panther certainly delivers. The movie uses the facade of culture to pretend like it's not part of Kevin Feiges manufacturing line of same old variations of cinema, but ultimately the shoot em up third act pretty much exposes the fact that black panther is another fun, somewhat funny, display of popcorn entertainment from marvel.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

Sure, some people like to hype it up and for good reason too. This film did a really good job at making a sympathizable villain who is kinda like Simba from Lion King but turned evil. The world building of Wakanda too was also amazing as it used a lot of African symbolism put together with advanced technology in a way that's difficult to find elsewhere. Overall, this movie was really entertaining and I give it a full 10 to balance out the many negative reviews here.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","The villain's motives are credible. He watched his father's death, bore the heavy history of black Americans, imagined the advanced wealth of his father's hometown, hated their inaction, and grew into an extremist. What he believed and came into contact with was might isright. It is the political intervention in other countries under the power and the discrimination and oppression of the non-ethnic group. In his eyes, whoever has a hard fist can be the boss. Who's the hardest fist? It's something he's never seen before, his father's hometown, Wakanda. So with hate, madness and ambition, he forcibly knocked on the closed Wakanda.
What Panther faces is where Wakanda should go. Dazzling technology, rich countries, top-notch armed forces, all these desirable forces, if only safe-corner, what is there.? Meaning? With this power, should we bear the responsibility at the same time?
Two people, for their own ideal society, face each other and life and death.

I feel sorry those that choose to negatively critique every detail and nuance of the film because they wanted to go in not liking it from the start...they truly missed out on just an enjoyable and entertaining film. This wasn't meant to be a epic drama it is a superhero fantasy film for all to enjoy. It is a shame it has to be pushed and pulled to meet some unattainable standard. It's entertainment there are certainly worst movies and could arguably be one of the better ones; but this doesn't deserve a one star as you see there are reviewers intent on keeping the ratings lower than what it truly deserves. Keeping in context this a fantasy superhero film then I feel it deserves every last one of the 10 stars. I hope MCU continues to develop this character and continues to offer the world yet another perspective on what a superhero can be and continue to nurture and develop this character and storyline with the same depth and compassion presented in this film. A superhero can be badass and also have compassion as one their super strengths...which in today's world actually is a super divine power since it seems to be lacking in many.

Most times to me they are hit or miss, they can be well made and entertaining (Guardians of The Galaxy/Iron Man) or completely shallow and boring with a terrible plot and poor dialogue (The Avengers). When comparing Black Panther to other Marvel Films it is an amazing movie and easily in my top 5 for Marvel, but when judging it as a stand alone film I'd say it's a good, but not great movie. The plot was engaging, the visuals were pleasing and it was well acted (over all). I would say it was about 20 min too long and felt like some scenes dragged on forever. My final take away would be that it is a well made, entertaining film that was slightly too long... it was one of the 1st if not 1st Major Blockbuster with a majority Black cast and crew which will make it a historic film.

Andy Serkis is awsome, as always. Michael B. Jordan stands out for the negative, as possibly one of the worst and dullest villains in movie history.

3045,14 June 2019,brucewadsworth,6," Upsettingly Wasted Potential, But Important Nonetheless.
","Black Panther is an important film. There's no denying this - The relevance of it's diverse and inclusive cast in a whirlwind of superhero movies that are some of the most seen and highest grossing films of the past decade (as well as being launchpads for a million different toys, models, figures sold across the world) is something you have to take into consideration when looking at this movie.
Objectively, this is a really entertaining watch! As with most marvel movies of late, much of the fight choreography is exciting and different, and the movie in general is... mostly well acted. Standout performances by Danai Gurira and Michael B. Jordan have to be mentioned; both actors play their parts with genuine sincerity, and add weight to a fairly lofty story (especially in the wake of 'more relevant to the MCU' films such as Civil War). Chadwick Boseman reprises his role as Black Panther from CW, but seems to float through this film with little direction? Obviously as an origin story of sorts, this makes sense, but CW introduced Black Panther PERFECTLY, so its odd that in his own film he holds so much less gravitas on screen. This, I believe may be down to one of my 2 major issues with this film: the script.
When I first watched this film, I found the pacing a bit clunky, and thought maybe the editing is abit choppy? Perhaps the actors are struggling to keep up with the narrative? But on rewatch, it occurred to me the script is confused. It simply cannot hold drama and comedy on its shoulders the way films like Infinity War did. Shuri is perhaps the most tired use of the Marvel comedy formula seen in one of these films yet - 'What are those!' was already an outdated meme by the time the film released, and is PAINFUL to hear. On the other hand, Killmonger's dying monologue by the sunset over Wakanda about his ancestors dying at sea on slave ships, is one of the most poignant moments in the entire MCU. How did they tonally screw this film so hard? Why was Martin Freeman in this film as unneeded, and unfunny comic relief? The script tries so hard in some places, but feels like a total afterthought in others. This, funnily enough paralelles my other main gripe with this film: The CGI.
Oh dear. When the universally unloved Spiderman 3 from 2007 has a far better looking subway fight scene than a larger franchised multi-million dollar blockbuster from nearly a decade its former, you know you've done something wrong. The film opens with quite a stunning credits sequence, stylised and detailed it gives you the sparknotes version of Wakanda and the Black Panther's history. Then Black Panther and Killmonger fight near some trains and good grief it looks BAD. 2 rubber men flung about on a green screen in a dimly lit cavern with nothing going on in the background. The choreography struggles here too, and considering this was the same year as Dr Strange? It's completely pitiful. Some of the absolute worst CGI Marvel has offered paying audiences in this decade (looking at you too, Homecoming).
Overall Black Panther does have a lot of merit. Like I mentioned, the importance of such a diverse blockbuster phenomenon is so great for representation in 2016. For others, the script will have been entertaining, and not everyone will notice the dreadful inconsistencies with the CGI. I can understand the high praise this movie got (Okay, maybe not 3 oscar noms worth, seriously?) But for me personally, these issues stuck out like a very sore, cat scratched thumb, meaning I cant give it more than a 6 and a half out of 10.

It would have served the movie better if the characters spoke in their native language, as it would have removed some of the stilted vibes from the dialogue.

","Black Panther is a great movie. It has plenty of flaws, but none that really should discourage you from seeing it. The only thing that really bugs me is the terrible, obnoxious hype for just an average film for Marvel. It doesn't have an underlying message or stands for empowerment. It has none of that. What it does have is black leads who do a good job and a fanbase larger than Michael Bay's ego. Chadwick Boseman's character, T'Challa, becomes the Black Panther after his father dies, and must fight to protect his kingdom, all while trying to live up to the previous Black Panther's legacy.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","Black Panther gives a deep dive into the story of prince T'Challa. Next in line for the throne the king to be played by Chadwick Boseman faces several challenges as he attempts to take his new role in the hierarchy of Wakanda. This story is a postscript as it takes place following the devastating loss of a family member previewed In Marvels Civil War. The film depicts the road to the throne as he is challenged by another contender. A contender that he was unaware even existed, let along had actual birth rights to the throne The story goes on to depict how ones environment can play a huge part in the outcome of the human psyche. Vibranium continues to push the advanced society of Wakanda forward even further as a seemly magical substance that can be of use in any necessary circumstance. We are introduced to Erik Killmonger an inner-city Harlem New-York native played by actor Michael B Jordan. He is smart, attractive, and a natural born killer with a prior military background and tactical training also did I mention he has a huge chip on his shoulder. He becomes a mercenary for hire and eventually comes face to face with our proteaginous. This tale is not your classic good versus evil story, it's a true look into the eyes of the oppressed and the moral obligation of the innocent bystander. We the audience experience this game of chess play out as Pawn captures Rook when Killmonger infiltrates the seeming impenetrable fortress of Wakanda. The theme seen through this film is exploring complex problems. T'Challa is forced to face the wrongs of a person he adores while making the decisions to move forward and protect his family and his people. The story reaches its climax in famous Marvel fashion as good vs evil comes face to face for the final battle that pins families, friends and even lovers against each other. This becomes an all-out intense brawl where no punches are pulled. Music and angles signify the intensities of the wars fought in T'Calla's mind and on the actual battlefield for his people. After the fierce battle ends and the dust clears, we arrive back in America in a not so privileged neighborhood. Black Panther emerges as a beacon of hope. This film is a much watch for adults and children alike as it not only provides insight to many social and economic issues, we face in our current climate but also gives hope that we can all live in harmony.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

3075,14 August 2018,cloudyear-71751,4," Overhyped, Stale, Brings Nothing New Too The Table
","This has to be the most Overhyped Movie I've seen this Year many saying this was the Best Superhero Movie, which felt like a pretty Bold Statement, but Therfore i was intrigued to see what all the Hype was about an... Boy was this Movie a Huge Letdown, now I really wanted to Like this Movie Black Panther was one of the best parts of Civil War an i was looking forward to where they'd take his character and they did Nothing with his Character he already had a Great Arc in Civil War as a Side Character yet somehow in his own Movie he feels Bland and That's the worst thing a Marvel Character can be cause they make Great Choices with the Actors that can Elevate the Material there Given, Chadwick Boseman who is a Great Actor was not good in this an I hate to say that cause his Scene in Civil War was some of the Best Acting I'd seen in a Marvel Movie, so for his First Solo Movie to be so Plain and feels empty which Sucks cause each Marvel Movie has a Distinct Tone an Vision the Director Brings, but Ryan Coogler who made Creed which is so Much Better than its Deserves to be, has made a Movie that feels like it has No Personality, its up there with Dr Strange or Ant-Man in terms of Style an even those Movies had Creative Action Scenes which all the Marvel Movies have done a pretty Great Job delivering, the Action in this besides a pretty Cool Car Chase which is elevated by the Music, any other action scene was Very Poorly handled from Terrible CGI and its not like the Movie doesn't have the Budget they just half-assed it when it came to the Action, Each Marvel Movie before has done a Good job with being Fun Popcorn that'll entertain, but this is one of the least Entertaining Movies they've put out in a while it was Boring in parts an that's the worst thing these Movies can be is Boring cause if the Action Sucks than the only thing you can Enjoy is the Story an Character's, Before seeing this I'd heard comparisons to Game of Thrones, and James Bond, besides the Normal Outsider comes to Dethrone the King that reminded me of The Lion King, it brings nothing New or Fresh to the Table besides a pretty Good Soudtrack, but other than that the Story was Generic you can predict where the stories can go, there was a Twist in the Movie that somewhat surprised me but that's pretty much it. The Characters in these Movies have had pretty strong Side Character's i can't say the same for this Movie, the Only Entertaining Character is Michael B Jordan as one of the better Marvel Villians but he feels like he's barley in the Movie he has his Introduction Scene, then leaves for awhile an doesn't return til the Low point Of the Story that Most of these Movies have an it was so Cliched an I don't get how People thought he was Dead in that scene, and if you ask me that scene should've taken place earlier in the Movie then we could see the Struggle of Black Panther coming back to the Throne but he just leaves for 10 mins an shows up then Beats the Bad Guy an everyone Wins, So Michael B Jordan is the Best Part of this Movie but he's barley in it enough so What are we left with... Well all of the other Characters are pretty Boring to watch not just the Character's but the scenes there in feel Pointless all they do is walk around and talk about unnecessary Stuff, the only interactions that where entertaining was Black Panther an his Sister who was a good Character until she became the ""Comedic Relief"" her Jokes didn't get a single laugh from me an besides making Cool Gear for the Hero she doesn't really have much of a Character, the Script feels rather Dry almost Like it was Written an Directed by a Machine it cause besides one Cool Shot nothing about this Movie felt Unique like everyone is Praising it to be, Before this Movie I had seen Thor Ragnarok an that Movie captures everything you'd Want from a Marvel Movies its Funny, its Creative, you can Feel the Director's Vision an Style it felt Different. This was a huge Downgrade over Ragnarok, an it is one of the Most Generic Superhero Movies I've seen in awhile so if your one of those People that Loves it cause you feel Empowered by having a Black Superhero Movie that's Great I just can't say i feel the same way, there are much better ""Black Movies"" out there as this is being called and Overall I'd give this a 4/10 it was very Dissapointing to Me besides one Cool Action scene along with one Good Performance this movie felt like one of the first Marvel Movies like Thor or Captain America but with a slightly better Budget but they didn't use it as well as they could've",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

It is a great movie about a Black character and it delivered an entertaining escape from the negativity of the world. Marvel delivered a young heroine who is a brainy nerd. It delivered another two strong women who were right up there fighting injustice with the men. It showed the people of Wakanda to be intelligent, compassionate and desiring peace.

This film should be normal but it isn't. Therefore, you cannot underestimate the symbolism of having a predominately black cast doing what action heroes do on the big screen.

BUTTT
I do not understand why the black panther's strength - both morally and physically was not put into more focus in the movie. i really cannot.
As a warrior in the caliber of Captain America i would expect the movie to give some weight to the fight scenes, unfortunatley T'challa's fights did not have enough focus choreography or proper editing, i never got the sense that he is a good serious fighter.
This is exactley what made captain america cool in the winter soldier.
T'challa did not have character defining choices to make that would let us know that he is dealing with something. the only ""choice"" he made was wether to stay with his ancestors or go back and fight, a choice with no weight on it.
lesset action , movies have made amazing fight scenes.
Logan for example used the action to charge the movie with tension and anticipation. This movie glossed through the fights as though it was a 60's bond movie.

","I read the amazing Black Panther comic book in 98 under the Priest run and it was the best comic run I had ever read. Such a great political study of both Wakanda and American ideals. Obviously this film borrows heavily from that run as well as Hudlin and Coates. The fascinating thing about this movie is using it as a ""what if?"" moment. Will a nation prosper if they have unique resources that was kept a secret for year? Wakanda is a nation that did not fall into the perils of colonialism and overreliance of other nations or ""aid"". The character study of TChalla and Killmonger is just as engaging. They are two sides of the same coin as their objective is to create a better world for their people. Though their methods are drastically different. Killmonger is a villain that, as an African American, you understand completely where he is coming from. He is one of Marvel's greatest villain since he provides an interesting challenge for TChalla, not just physically but morally. Coogler did a great job balancing a movie as complex as this with a great action superhero film. The action is nothing to sneeze at since it was breathtaking in most scenes. There ARE some CGI problems here or there but it was still good, especially the casino fight with a great score pacing the scene. The supporting cast is strong, especially Shuri, a different character from the comics but still fascinating.

3111,24 February 2018,BatMatticamus,7," A Strong but Imperfect Addition to the MCU
","What's it about?
Black Panther is the latest addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe - the eighteenth movie in this grand experiment in an expanded universe. Directed by Hollywood up-and-comer Ryan Coogler (Fruitvale Station, Creed), the story follows T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the titular Black Panther, as he ascends to the throne of Wakanda following the death of his father in 2016's Captain America: Civil War. But things become more complicated when enemies appear, revealing dark family secrets and throwing the nation into turmoil.
Much of the early part of the film is devoted largely to world-building; Wakanda is a place quite unlike any of the rest of the Marvel universe (or the real world, for that matter). Ostensibly a poor, backward African nation (of the sort often described by Western stereotypes), Wakanda is in reality a wealthy technologically-advanced nation thriving in secret due to a rich supply of vibranium fallen centuries past from a meteor. As it has developed in isolation, its technology is fairly dissimilar from even the comics-style depictions of Western technology, and its rich culture, drawn from many real-world African sources, necessitates an exposition-heavy first act. 
The conflict begins when Ulysses Klaue, played by a scenery-chewing Andy Serkis, steals, then attempts to sell a chunk of Wakandan vibranium, and escalates when Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), an associate of Klaue, attempts to seize the throne for himself. This plunges T'Challa and his entourage, including a charmingly out-of-his depth Martin Freeman as CIA agent Everett Ross, into a violent power struggle marked by betrayal, sacrifice, and difficult questions concerning power, race, and global geopolitical dynamics.
What works?
While Chadwick Boseman makes an excellent lead, capturing simultaneously the dignity of a king and the ferocity of the Black Panther, the character has since its comics debut in 1966 been best defined by his supporting cast and the world-building around him. Clearly the creative forces behind Black Panther-writer Joe Robert Cole and writer-director Ryan Coogler-understood this point because the supporting cast is excellent and the world-building is as rich and compelling as any put to film. Among the supporting characters it is difficult to choose a single standout, but Black Panther's irreverant tech-genius sister Shuri, played by breakout star Letitia Wright, is hilarious and memorable. The Walking Dead's Danai Gurira too is incredibly compelling as the fierce Okoye, leader of the Dora Milaje, the elite squad of Wakandan women who serve as personal bodyguards to the king. Lupita Nyong'o is also quite good as T'Challa's friend and sometime love interest Nakia, while Daniel Kaluuya, Winston Duke, Angela Basset, Forest Whitaker, John Kani, and several others do excellent work in smaller roles. One climactic scene in particular showcases several of the supporting actors at their best in a complex and engrossing emotional tableau, making the scene all the more powerful.
Michael B. Jordan's performance is also excellent as Killmonger. Deliberately written to be incongruous as compared to the reserved, dignified Wakandan characters, he embraces the challenge while not ever going overboard (something that unfortunately cannot be said for co-villain actor Andy Serkis). The character himself is good, combing powerful motivations with a compelling and threatening on-screen presence. 
The world-building too is extremely compelling. Wakanda's culture is fleshed out enough that the viewer gets a sense of the rich, deep history defining the nation, and much of the technology is unique and interesting, though occasionally straying too far into comic-book unreality, testing the limits of suspension of disbelief. But the visual landscape of the Wakandan world is intricately designed and incredibly beautiful, and this reviewer for one expects it to garner some well-deserved Oscar attention in the Costume Design, Production Design, and Makeup and Hairstyling categories come next winter. 
Ludwig Göransson's (Get Out, Creed) score is also rich and detailed, largely combining elements of both typical (though beautiful) Hollywood orchestral writing with the vibrant soundscape of traditional African song and drums, though it also incorporates hip-hop elements to great effect, as well as the occasional out-and-out pop or rap song. Between this and last year's Thor: Ragnarok, it seems that Marvel has recognized an oft-leveled criticism that its films' music is typically mediocre orchestral or electronic fare, and allowed its composers to express more individuality and build much more interesting scores (this is the first time I can recall coming out of a Marvel movie humming one of the themes). 
It would be horribly remiss to praise this film without acknowledging Ryan Coogler's superb direction. He showed with Creed that he could stage and orchestrate a fight scene as well as anyone in Hollywood, and with Black Panther he only proved that Creed was no fluke. One beautiful early fight is done mostly in long, smooth takes reminiscent of the one-shot fight from Creed, while a later one is broken and choppy (though always entirely comprehensible) in a way that helps simulate the emotional tone of the scene. The lone car chase in the film too is strong, though occasionally almost tentative, not milking its most exciting ideas for all they could be worth.
But Coogler's action directing is not the only technical aspect worthy of praise. He and cinematographer Rachel Morrison use a camera like Joshua Bell uses a violin-with a deep understanding of the content at play and a laser-like focus on communicating it to the viewer in the most powerful, visually exciting way. Marvel has had good success in the past with lesser-known directors like the Russo brothers, but with Coogler's success here and Taika Waititi's excellent work on Thor: Ragnarok, it seems like Marvel may be changing its modus operandi somewhat and allowing more-established directors to make films with more of their personal style, and it seems like an effective formula.
What doesn't?
Unfortunately, one of the greatest strengths of Black Panther-its rich supporting cast and deep world-building-is ultimately the consequence of one of its greatest downfalls; too many ideas are present for one two-hour film, and some have to suffer for it. The attention to detail devoted to the world of Wakanda and to the characters who populate it comes at the cost of a promising but ultimately flawed villain in Killmonger. Without giving away too much, Killmonger's motivations need a fair amount of exposition and development, plus a well-established, unified, ideologically-developed Wakanda. The latter is largely done, but the former is somewhat lacking. Perhaps the filmmakers would have been better served by saving the Killmonger story for a sequel-Klaue is the original main villain from the Black Panther comics, and would have served perfectly well as a villain for the standalone movie, especially with his role as a directly-opposed outsider reinforcing Wakanda's unity and isolationism, common themes from the comics. Then, with an already-built Wakanda, it would have been much easier to create a deeper thematic challenge with Killmonger. Combining all of the world-building plus two villains leads to an overstuffed plot which ultimately hinders the power of Killmonger as his own villain, though it does also result in a few excellent moments.
Some of the other characters and threads also suffer from this plot density. Daniel Kaluuya's W'Kabi in particular stands out as a wasted opportunity. Kaluuya has been proving the past few years that he deserves more attention as an actor, and his limited screen time and underdeveloped character are disappointing. Nakia and T'Challa's relationship too is perhaps somewhat underdeveloped when it deserved more.
The humor too is lacking. While the serious tone is a refreshing change after a year of humorous MCU entries, the attempts to interject jokes and humorous moments fall flat far too often; Klaue is much less funny than the writers seemed to think he would be, and there are a couple of jokes which fall depressingly flat-a ""What are thoooose?!"" joke feels dated already and the awkward way in which it's included in the scene feels uncomfortably forced. There are some good humorous moments-Winston Duke's M'Baku stands out in a few funny moments-but overall the humor does little to help the film as a whole.
But is it any good?
Yes! Marvel has a great track record, especially over the past couple years, and Black Panther is an entirely worthy addition to the MCU canon. As a film, it is probably not among the highest echelon of superhero movies, but its flaws do not prevent it from being a well-made, entertaining, and thematically-serious movie. It stands on its own too, and there's certainly no need for a potential viewer to have been caught up on the MCU, so if you like a good superhero movie, good action movie, or good movie in general, this will be right up your alley.
But the merits of Black Panther do not lie only in its successes as a film. Its cultural impact too deserves mention. Between Creed, Moonlight, and Get Out Hollywood has had a strong run of success the past few years from black writers, directors, and actors, and Black Panther represents a breaking-out of this trend into the mainstream. As of this writing, Black Panther has had one of the best Thursday previews of all time, and word-of-mouth certainly seems likely to help rather than hurt it, so it should go on to make a lot of money and good attention for Marvel. It seems that black filmmaking talent is finally coming into its own in Hollywood, and Black Panther should only serve to further this trend.
So all-in-all, Black Panther is a strong addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a successful, if imperfect, standalone movie.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

No, I don't think it's essential. But it's a fun spin-off. The story wasn't incredible or anything and the villain Killmonger was perhaps a bit underwhelming (although I liked Jordan's performance, Killmonger simply isn't a Venom, Green Goblin or Magneto).

","In a movie market where superheroes are dominating the scene, it is of little surprise that Disney's Marvel keeps producing new backstories to beloved superheroes. As someone that frequently continues to see the movies while they are still on the big screen, I am a fan of new heroes getting their share at they're own background story in order to further develop the Marvel franchise as a whole. I tend to enjoy single hero movies a bit more than the collaborations, as they tend to have more depth than the action packed, multi superhero movies; I am actually a huge fan of Captain America: The First Avenger. That being said, I was not the biggest fan of this movie. It had some jaw dropping visuals and some interesting sci fi tech that will hopefully be utilized heavily in Infinity War, but it did not have much beyond that. The overarching story line is not terrible, but it isn't great. The what was thought to be the main villain is killed about half way through and has very little depth. The man that kills him happens to be a kid that witnessed the aftermath of the King killing his brother and spent his whole life seeking revenge. Cliche much? One of the best parts of superhero stories is that their counterpart villain is just as interesting as the hero itself, the main villain in this story was relatively boring and came as a ""shock"" that was not really much of a shock. Most of this stories ""twists"" were easily predictable and hit on a ton of cliches. While this makes for a shallow, relatively boring story, it does not make for a bad movie in whole. Overall, it was simply average. It is not the worst Marvel movie I have seen, but it is certainly not the best. Hopefully Infinity War is leaps and bounds greater than this.

3170,11 March 2018,mrrexx,8," Just an opinion.
","Impromptu Black panther review (no spoilers not even really a review just an opinion of mine). Its a must watch, even if your not a marvel fan go see it. I rewatched yesterday and I must say Ryan coogler (director) and Chadwick boseman (protagonist) are geniuses (as well as the whole cast). People say Chadwick was overshadowed by such strong supporting actors and actresses and that's hard to argue with. Danai Gurira absolutely stole the show in my opinion, Letitia Wright was hilarious and a great addition to the marvel roster, Andy Serkis absolutely nailed it, Winston Duke had an amazing Hollywood debut and Michael b Jordan was probably the most developed, sadistic yet relatable villain in the marvel cinematic universe so far. but since rewatching I'm starting to think this choice was intentional. I feel like with it being marvel it was bound for success from the start. come on, a marvel movie in 2018 is going to bring in the crowd regardless. I believe Ryan and Chadwick were well aware of this so Chadwick purposely took a backseat role in his own movie to really let the others shine I believe as a kind of nod to the audience and studio executives kind of like 'hey look what a predominantly black cast of relatively unknown actors can achieve with a big budget and some creative freedom'. Not to take anything away from him though his performance was great. I'm a big fan of black panther and I think his portrayal was spot on. Noble, Deep thinking and calculated. even his arc in the movie is really deep and well thought out dealing with death, grief, lies and betrayal. he just plays it quite low key and reserved so as not to overshadow anyone but in a way that totally works and matches the black panthers character. Overall the film was a complete success commercially and financially, and I think now the world (and Hollywood) has been shown what is possible and what black people in the movie industry can achieve it should open up a world of opportunity for more film's like this to be made. And shout out to the marvel higher ups for letting coogler and others make the film they wanted. Don't really know how to end this and I feel like I'm rambling now soooo... Rating out of ten - the film itself for me is a 8.9/10 would be a nine but I felt some of the CG was slightly underwhelming. For pure spirit, fun and an amazing cast it's 10/10 question.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","Following the hype train for months prior to the release of this movie, I was excited to watch this. After the release of the movie, it received sparkling remarks from everyone I spoke to and the most popular being ""Best superhero movie ever"". I never believed that would be true and after I finally watched it, I could not have been angrier. This movie is overrated and overhyped. The plot feels shallow and doesn't actually kick in till halfway through the movie. Felt like a classic Disney movie made for children. The villain was hyped and as being the most ""relatable"". Yes, he's more relatable than a living planet but relating to KIllmonger is like relating to the leaders of most terrorist organizations in the world today. (No joke, they literally have the same motivations and goals as he does). Michael B. Jordan's portrayal was unconvincing, bland and the furthest thing from funny when he delivered his one-liners. The main character of the movie was boring and weak. He needed to be bailed out of almost every fight he got into. The movie tried to be funny but could not deliver on that aspect. The CGI and sound design looked like they were ripped out of a video game on a Playstation 3.

Nevertheless, it was a pleasant experience to see positive and strong black heroes. In a generation that we all come to associate superheroes, from Jesus to Superman and Wonderwoman with white people, this is a big deal.

Now the villian Killmonger was very well acted by Michael B Jordan and it's very sad to see him die as it felt like the movie didn't show a lot of him in it. The problems I had with this movie were some of the fight scenes in the beginning and one at the end. The ones in the beginning were too fast paced and you had no idea what was going on. The one at the end when Black Panther is fighting Killmonger, at one point they seem very cartoonish and it makes the scene look rigid and not agile (or catlike). Sometimes it was also hard to know what they were saying due to accent but you still got the general idea of what they were trying to say. I was very excited for this movie but I feel like it was over-hyped. There wasn't a lot of action and the director saying that it would be the James Bond of the MCU was not shown in this movie at all. It felt more of a Lion King story where T'Challa must fight for the throne. It did make me close to crying at 2 points in the movie but never did it it make me butt clench in the action scenes.

Black Panther is not one of the good movies. It's not a good superhero movie and definitely not a good movie overall. It lacks originality as well as a good quality plot, acting is fine but nothing special, no good characters except maybe the villain, but he is nothing special.

3218,16 September 2018,davidandrewochs,10," A Masterpiece in Every Way
","Black Panther is just one of the latest in what has been an impressive string of movies in the Marvel cinematic universe. Even with all of the hype leading up, I did not expect this movie to be nearly as good as other superhero movies that had come out prior such as Thor: Ragnarok, Spider-Man: Homecoming, or Captain America: Civil War. I was dead wrong. Chadwick boseman could not have been a better choice to play the film's main character T'Challa and that goes for the rest of the star-studded cast. Across the board the acting is excellent and it is all driven by a plot that is so good it has you even feeling sympathy for the antagonist in the plot Killmonger. Black panther is the first mainstream movie to ever feature a black protagonist superhero as well as feature a predominantly African American cast. At the start of the film we are given some context as to who these Wakandans are and where they come from including a saying so catchy it had myself yelling it out of the theatre for days ( WAKANDA FOREVA!!!!) The music even sets the mood of whatever the current scene is perfectly to the point where you are totally invested in everything panther. Boseman is both charismatic and resilient in every way in this film and shows incredible mental strength even more than physical. Not to mention the suit is by far the coolest ever made! As I watched this, I could not believe just how blown away I truly was. I came in knowing nothing about this place wakanda and it's universe and characters and came out wishing I was young enough to be them all for Halloween this year. Michael B. Jordan is so good that when he overthrows T'Challa I was actually mad in the theatre. Everything about this movie screams greatness and a classic. Although the film did not have quite as much humor as Thor did, the story was so much emotionally deeper and complete. In reviews I like to at least attempt to point out something I feel could have been done differently, or better, but with Black Panther I truly cannot. It was that good. There will be sequels simply because it is a marvel movie, but if there never was this would go down as an all time classic not only for its quality but also the importance it serves to the African American kids who never have seen a superhero their same skin color. This movie hits on all notes and levels and blew me away and continues to every time I watch it. I've watched it 6 times. Good job Marvel.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","For being a superhero movie, this film could possibly be the breakthrough movie of the year. All of the characters, even the villain, you felt like you could understand where they were coming from. The movie takes place a week or so after the events of Civil War, so T'Challa has to deal with being the Black Panther, as well as being king of Wakanda. One of the biggest plot points in the film is whether or not Wakanda should show the world their tech, as they are more advanced than any other country. So, the Black Panther and his ""crew"" go out and try to stop Klau, who is one of the people who stole their tech. Back to Killmonger. To many people, including myself, this villain could be second or better than the best villain in the MCU, Loki. The reason for this again is of how his father had betrayed Wakanda, and T'Challa's father killed and completely forgot about Erik. This is the spark that adds to his fire, and the main reason he wants to take over Wakanda, which he does, for a little bit. Now, after that bit. The fight scenes in this movie were done very well, especially the car racing scene. But, the last scene was not done as well as I would have hoped. Some of the CGI was off, and was a little weird. 
With that being my only complaint about the movie, Black Panther is one of the best films in the MCU, and I'm really looking forward to what Marvel does with him in Infinity War.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","Let me start off and say that this film is aesthetically pleasing. The visuals of 
Wakanda are amazing, along with the the costume designs and cinematography. For the most part, the CGI was decent, but in some parts it looked very fake. At times you could tell that the characters were in front of a green screen. 
Now onto the acting, I have to say that all the actors and actresses did a fantastic job. Chadwick Boseman nailed it as the king of Wakanda, along with his friends. All the characters were diverse and unique. Shuri, played by Letitia Wright, was probably my favorite character in the movie, as she ailed it as a smart teenager. 
The villains of the movie, Kilmonger and Ulysses Klaue, were fantastic as well. I felt that they shouldn't have killed off Klaue, as his performance was amazing and it would've been cool to see him in other MCU films. Kilmonger was good too, but I felt that he was trying to act ""too tough"" at times, when he was already intimidating.
Now let me say that they did an excellent job on depicting the Wakandan culture. This seperates this movie from many other MCU films and makes it unique.

Even though Killmonger is the villain, he is still one of my favourite characters in the movie. He is a tortured soul that acts out of hatred and ends up on the wrong path, even though he thinks his actions are righteous. I also like the fact that they chose to play the Marvel Studios logo after his introduction in the start. It was a unique and different way to place the logo, compared to other Marvel movies. At first it seemed weird, but after watching the movie you understand the intention. As the camera zoomed away from the kids looking up at the sky, the logo plays, which marked the birth of the future villain Killmonger. That was the turning point, and when rewatching that scene, it just plays out perfectly. Such small details are true movie art, unlike Last Jedi which tries hard, but ultimately turned out pretentious.

Don't get me wrong it's a well made movie but just like some Marvel movies in the past it doesn't do anything new. Sure it shows off African culture but other than that it is still the same film we've seen over and over again. What I do like about this movie is how character driven it is as opposed to just being filled with action scene after action scene. The characters are pretty good for the most part however I did feel that Black Panther himself was probably the most boring which is a shame because he was so great in Civil War. All the actors do a good job and I never felt like anyone stood out in terms of bad performances except for Michael B. Jordan who seemed to phone it in some times. A lot of the problems in this movie are due to inconsistencies. For the sake of not spoiling anything an example I would use are the special effects which range from good to downright terrible.

3287,10 August 2018,grandmoffkark,3," Seriously Overrated...like most popular films.
","Black Panther is one of the worst films Marvel Entertainment have ever released. This was a film made around a cool character in Captain America 3: Civil War, and it was made for two reasons: A.) To pander to SJW-BLM types, B.) To explain the country of Wakanda for Infinity War. It met aim A.) very well...didn't meet B.) very well however. To expand on why it didn't; allow me to explain. Black Panther barely explores the nation of Wakanda, it briefly mentions how the became a technological powerhouse, yet doesn't explain why the properties of vibranium were so potent and how they discovered this. Character's like Tony Stark would have studied vibranium based off of Caps. shield. This is silly, and only proceeds to establish the priorities of the writers; that being to create characters that can pander to the audience. This was effectively the first 5 minutes of the film. Just to give you perspective on how utterly incompetent it is. Later on in the film we're told about how the Black Panther gets his power. It's is granted through a special plant...a plant that only one person is allowed to use...which is the most stupid thing I've ever heard. It's stupid for two main reasons: A.) Why would you not grant all of your soldiers the special flower-power? They would effectively become an unstoppable fighting force. Wakanda Warrior (Teechalla or something like that) is useless without it; illustrating how powerful it can make a mere weakling. B.) If the answer to A.) is along the lines of ""Giving too many people the flower-power would decrease the significance of the Black Panther"" you would be correct. It is clearly done for plot reasons, as without the flower power; Wakanda Warrior would be useless. However, my question would then be; Why, if Wakandan Scientists have shown an innate ability to manipulate resources that possess unique properties, have the Wakanda scientists been unable to either: Strengthen the potency of the Flower-power, thus giving the Black Panther even greater abilities over the foot soldiers, or make a weakened version; thus also maintaining the Black Panther's superiority. Either of those make far greater sense than simply restricting it to one member of society. This incompetence then also brings into question whether or not Wakandan people are actually intelligent, or if it was just done for plot reasons...do you see my point yet? Thus far the film has explained a version of Wakanda that does not exist in Infinity War, it is a nation of Plot Armour, Lazy writing, and unintelligent scientists (or writers). This trend continues to occur with the rest of the film, failing to explain how advancements in vibranium led to shield cloaks. The film is simply ridiculous, and the only thing it did successfully was pander to it's audience. Congratulations I guess. Don't watch it, don't support it in any way; else you are simply telling the writers to make more poorly written films like this in future instalments.

Good: The outifts were very colorful, and the African art looked nice. 
Bad: 1) an advanced society that has a monarchy, has fight-challenges, and with knives and spears? 2) how does a society become so advanced when cut-off from the world? the people there are an order-of-magnitude more intelligent than others? they sure didn't act it. 3) I understand what they were trying to do with the Africanized-English accents, but it made it hard to understand the dialogue at many points, 4) because the dialogue was not clear, the plot and subplots were lost on me. All I know is that they were all related and some relaties killed each other and there was revenge ... I really didn't feel anything for these characters, so I didn't rerun the scenes on the DVD, 5) no memorable special effects, 6) no cool, great music theme.

Every scene had a white-bashing, anti-American narrative for a country that clearly explains how it's OK to exist in a virtual utopia, while letting the rest of Africa be eaten by parasitic worms, die of malnutrition and spread AIDS like wildfire.
The accents were way over the top. Have any of the producers or actors had linguistic coaches involved? At one point, you'd think that some of them were from Jamaica.
The story falls apart almost from the very beginning. A society that had such advanced technology wouldn't obsessively embrace living like they were still in the stone age.

3360,5 May 2019,niesen-67805,6," High Expectations with a Bad Delivery
","Black Panther was released in January of 2018 and is the sixteenth film in the Marvel Comics film series that originated with Captain America: The First Avenger and has progressed through to Avengers: Endgame. I expected Black Panther to be a face paced action packed film with a countless amount of physical actions shots but ended up having a surprisingly slow to start to the film. In comparison to its predecessors in the Marvel series, I expected a great film but was let down and only got about fifty percent of what I had hoped the film would be.
Black Panther was written by Stan Lee, directed by Ryan Coogler, and produced by Kevin Feige being released in the United States by Marvel Studios. Chadwick Boseman played the main character T'Challa or better known as the Black Panther, and his rival Erik Killmonger who was also his cousin was played Michael B. Jordan. Throughout Black Panther, Killmonger and Black Panther had a disturbed complex human relationship because Black Panther's father T'Chaka played by John Kani abandoned Killmonger after his Uncle Zuri played by Forest Whitaker killed Killmonger's father.
The conflict between Black Panther and Killmonger was not immediately recognizable but became the focus of attention when Killmonger returned to Wakanda to challenge King T'Challa for the throne to rule over the five tribes of Wakanda. Another integral character throughout the film was General Okoye played by Danai Gurira who was the leader of the Dora Milaje Tribe who was responsible for the guarding and protection of Wakanda and the royal family.
During the film, it was very prevalent that a decent amount of the action sequences was set during the nighttime or indoors with dark and shadowy backgrounds and the slower paced shots were filmed in a bright and colorful setting. Being that the movie is titled Black Panther, I expected a darker scene setting but the amount of dimly lit scenes detracted from the overall colorfulness that Wakanda presented. Black Panther had a short timespan with the cutting speeds between the shots and utilized the parallel cut to bounce back and forth between the action scenes. This took place during the car chase scene alternating between the lab in Wakanda and the South Korean streets. The parallel cut was utilized during the flying towards the back half of the film. The longest cutting speed during the film was the slow-motion scene when Killmonger was watching the ship disappear with the killers of his father. The slow-motion aspect of the scene was important to show the abandonment of the young Wakandans child by his fellow Wakandans.
Overall Black Panther was a necessary part of the Marvel Film Universe, but it lacked the excitement and action pack sequences of the films in the series. Another downfall of Black Panther was the lack of explanation of how the berries and flowers gave him his powers. I am not a reader of comic books, and this could be why I did not understand the little nuances of the film.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

Black Panther captures the beauty of Africa, from the costumes inspired by various tribes, warriors, etc. protecting their valuable resources. Think about gold, diamonds, oil, and uranium and the many other precious metals of Africa and what has become of the countries where these resources exist. I read a comment on IMDb that described the film as divisive. When we take into account major blockbuster hits like The Great Wall with Matt Damon, God's of Egypt, Johnny Depp in Lone Ranger, and Jake Gyllenhal in Prince of Persia (To name only a few), these are all movies that we should consider divisive, especially when the main roles that should star native Americans, Iranians, Egyptians, and Chinese actors but star American white men, Black Panther is a breath of fresh air.

3378,17 February 2018,danw-36169,5," Another origin story
","Black Panther should be rated somewhere in the middle of the Marvel origin stories. I feel that as far as the origin stories go, they seem to follow a pattern that goes something like this: The top origins were funny, and serious, had action, interesting characters, smart dialogue and a decent story line. The worst were long, slow and little action or most of the action was at the end. I would suggest that ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and ""Deadpool"" were tied for #1 as the best of the origins, while ""Thor"" and ""Fantastic 4"" were arguably two of the worst. The first ""Iron Man"" was somewhere near the top but ""Captain America"" was probably closer to the bottom. ""Wolverine's"" origins was probably somewhere in the middle, since people seem to love it or hate it. The rest are all sprinkled somewhere in between. (Sorry if I left some out and being true to the comic story line was not considered since that is a measure mostly for true comic book fans). Black Panther has a decent story line, good villains (but kill of a colorful one early), but is rather slow at times and is light on the action until the end. This movie has patterns of both the best and worst origin stories. It is not the best but it is certainly not the worst. It's somewhere in the middle.What is most unfortunate for those of us that really want to like this movie was the stupid levels of super-over-hype by the media and critics. .",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

","This is the best movie ever made by marvel. Ryan Coogler's masterful superhero drama is unlike any other, featuring outstanding acting, breathtaking art direction, fascinating royal intrigue, memorable action sequences, and surprising depth. It's that depth -- of character, of storyline, of relevancy -- that makes Black Panther shine, as Boseman's T'Challa takes the mantle of king with enormous uncertainty about whether to share Wakanda's resources with the world. With the exception of his second-in-command W'Kabi (Kaluuya), T'Challa surrounds himself with an inner circle of influential women: Okoye, Nakia, his mother (Bassett), and his genius younger sister, scientist/tech inventor Shuri (Letitia Wright). Each of them contributes much to the story, with Gurira's spear-wielding Okoye the movie's clear scene-stealer, Wright the clever comic relief, and Nyong'o offering a wee bit of romance. Even the central villain, as played by frequent Coogler collaborator Jordan, is well-rounded and humanized, with the actor doing great work opposite the equally nuanced Boseman.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

3406,4 March 2018,theggbydealy,8," A full and honest review
","PROS 
1) A villainous villain? 
Killmonger was an interesting twist into what a villain was supposed to be. I felt conflicted as to who support because I understood why he felt this way. Growing up hard in Oakland meant that he wanted to see other people rise up, and he felt Wakanda wasn't doing much to help. This puts him in a grey area - not all bad, not all good. This is very good in my opinion, it wasn't a ""I want to destroy the world because I'm BAD!"" We actually understand his point and WHY he thinks the way he does, which makes his fights with T'Challa or the Black Panther much more compelling.
2) Wonderful symbolism
The fight scene where Black Panther is ""revived"" and causes a full blow out fight to happen: What a touching moment when Daniel Kaluuya (W'Kabi) lays down his sword. He doesn't keep on fighting: This is a message that Africans can only move forward when they work together, when they overcome differences.

The car action scenes had me excited in the cinema, same with the casino fight with the lady in the red dress. There was some humour in it which I liked because it didn't feel as forced as in Age of Ultron or similar Marvel pieces. The characters' backstories and motivations actually made me care about them. They seemed sympathetic and not as hollow as in Dr. Strange where I really couldn't bring myself to like anyone in the whole movie. This film actually made me shed one (1) manly tear in the cinema (a first). One complaint I have is with the final fight scene in the dark with both combattants wearing dark suits where you could never quite see what was going on.

3414,14 February 2018,thierrysmall,7," no connection to T'challa
","It was a good film don't get me wrong but the main reason i didn't really like the film as much as everyone else is because i prefer killmongers character to t'challa. Having a villain like this is only good when you have an established superhero which you already feel emotions for. For example daredevil and the punisher. After watching daredevil season 1 you feel emotions towards daredevil making you always want to support him then with the introduction to the punisher and his origin it creates a choice for you to choose between daredevil and punisher in which morally you would end up supporting daredevil because of the heroism he has already shown. The tough choice you have to make adds some depth and emotional value to the show/film and makes the rest of the film/show more interesting. T'challa has not shown this heroism and sacrifice in the MCU yet. The only appearance was him trying to hunt down bucky for murdering his father. In civil war his role isnt very important and we do not get emotionally attached. t'challa seemed more interested in getting the girl than helping the outside world and takes him the whole movie to realise that he should help. That doesnt seem heroic to me. the origin of killmonger was far more touching and i felt his goals were justified. having your father killed by your own people while you are a child whilst your dad promised to take you back there must have been very hard and the amount of work he put into becoming king shows his motivation. Killmonger wasn't a villain by choice but was made one by the environment of which the wakandans left him in. Leaving him alone in the oppression that he faced was obviously not going to end well. t'challa's reaction to him coming to wakanda was not remorseful but was rude and didn't try to make up for his fathers mistake. it seems very hypocritical as he says something about not judging him on past kings but killmonger already put at a disadvantage due to his father. After beating t'challa, he in my eyes was the true king and for a place that goes on honour and ritual cheating to bring t'challa back by giving him the strength of the black panther doesn't seem right to me. You look at killmonger as a villain but he was only doing what our governments do everyday by giving and selling weapons to keep people oppressed. Meaning all the american superheroes you support are bad. All of this would be great for a sequel because we would have more of a connection to t'challa making us want him to win and question ourselves on the way. But i don't at this point and wasn't happy when t'challa prevailed i just felt disappointed. im not saying i agree with what killmonger was doing i just don't agree with t'challa either.",/review/rw4193069/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_2018

3424,25 February 2018,skapade2,8," All The Stars are Closer - Black Panther Review
","Black lives matter on that note the all-new Marvels Cinematic standalone movie came and hit each every record across the globe, with a cast of more than 90% African-American actors this movie stunned entire critics and audiences and proved that there is no supremacy when there is an art to represent, all-new standalone movie was a real piece of art which beautifully represents the entire African culture and colors.
It has taken a decade i.e. 18 movies all the start from Iron Man (2008) - some movies were good and some were average, it really gives an idea that how big road was that for thousands of people who made this journey spectacularly amazing and fun and yet still the Marvels Studios are continuously giving us that amaze face, but now with that all experience the expectations are also increased and I am sure Black Panther certainly proved that they are still the best when it comes to making superhero movie. 
Balck Panther is a film that tells us that as to embrace the future you need to respect that past. So it all begins with a Wakanda, a fictional African nation that was hidden away from the rest of the world due to their rich resource of ""Vibranium "" a meteor that hit Wakanda centuries ago.
It is the home of prince T'Challa who recently faced a tragedy as the King of Wakanda i.e T'Challa's father was murdered in Berlin during Captain America: Civil War movie, the film rightly set after the events of Captain America. And now T'Challa must return to Wakanda to take over the throne and become the rightful heir. This movie is all about the futuristic technology of Wakanda that how they embrace the Vibranium into the day to day life. 
Black Panther was not even a superhero movie for entire one hour. like the other Marvel Standalone movies, for example, Ant-Man or Doctor Strange were concentrated towards a single role or character, but with Black Panther, it was totally different the characters like Nakia, Okoye, Shuri, and Everett Ross shared equally good performance especially Okoye leader of Dora Milaje (special bodyguards of King) and rightfully like other viewers I also demand separate movie or series exclusively for ""Dora Milaje"". So it was basically a group performance which converts simple superhero movie into something special. Some quick cuts between separate scenes were making the film fragile and thus it was taking a time to grasp, only that was the little disappointment in the entire movie. But when it comes to positive note some scenes like the car chase in South Korea, battle scenes of Dora Milage with other tribes were certainly impressive but not impressive as Iron Man 2 Formula one scene or Captain America taking down entire Hydra agents with his shield and fist. But still, the action sequences were really fun to watch.
Like Captain America: Civil War Black Panther was also geopolitical thriller action Movie but more than that it was wonderful CGI movie, loaded with great waterfalls, landscapes, cities and yes huge Rhinoceros also plus they also kept the beautiful African culture intact by adding traditional African tribal background music and the special credit goes to Kendrick Lamar for giving entire music.
The core division of movie was divided into two different thoughts of Black community one was to keep their world safe from the outsiders and another was to fight with clash of cultures, two different homes and burden of their ancestors as to give the proof of their powerful existence, which gives us the thought that the intentions of villain Erick Killmonger were not so wrong as he wants to uprise his community like every villain is the hero of his story.
And thus it's compulsory to talk about ""The Villains"" in this movie like the other Marvels movies villain were practically a joke but in this movie, there were two powerful villains i.e. Ulysses Klaus (Andy Serkis) and Erick Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) and both were super badass correct that's the right word of description for the first half Ulysses Klaus (Andy Serkis) totally stole the show it was like that I was watching Heath Ledger but the face was of Andy Serkis and then Erick Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) a proud, muscular, and challenging fighter a right match for Black Panther and that's one of the main reasons why this movie is so special.
And yes if you are die-hard Marvels fan you know you have to wait until the multiplex employees start to stare at you. Know what I mean...!!! 
 Really It was a treat to watch though it was not 100% perfect still beautifully represented a must watch.

","When I came into this movie I had really low expectations, which is probably why I'm giving it a 7 out of 10. Everyone else had high expectations and were disappointed, so it makes sense that they are rating it so low. But honestly if the hype hadn't been there it probably would have gotten reviews similar to mine. Instead, the reviews seem to be a mix of 1 star ratings from disappointed viewers and 10 star ratings from people who like it just cause there's a mostly African cast in it.
This movie is nothing special plot wise really. It doesn't really feel believable, and the conflict was highly unnecessary. The main baddie was arrogant and angry to a point of being also not really believable or sympathetic, though the movie obviously wants you to sympathize for him. His lines at some point were so generic they were funny. Also his logic behind things are extremely flawed. He is supposed to be a villain who people sympathize for because of his cause, but he honestly just seems like a radical BLM terrorist. If they were trying to raise awareness for African Americas, they are doing a reverse effect if anything.
Overall the acting was bland. Even Martin Freeman was a bore. I kind of liked the Claw guy or whatever his name was as he was the closest thing to humour in the movie besides the lame attempt to be trendy with the ""what are those"" joke..
The combat isn't as occurrent as in other movies, and honestly I didn't really mind that. One thing I do think though is sometimes they overpowered the characters to a point of the little conflict there was being boring.
Visually I liked the movie a lot. The costumes were pretty cool and everything was colourful and it didn't even feel like a marvel movie. In fact it didn't even feel like a cliche movie as the aesethetic managed to distract me from the blandness of the plot till after seeing it.
The soundtrack was alright, some of the songs were good but it wasn't any LotR or Batman.
I feel like the main selling point was the fact that there was a black dominated cast. Honestly it's not that big of a deal and I don't see why people hyped this movie so much. This is 2018. It's not such a shocker to have black protagonists. And for the record, Black Panther was not the first black superhero to make it to the big screen.
As much as I don't think this should be a 97% rated movie or anything, I also disagree with the 1 star reviews on here. It's not a terrible movie. Story wise it's basically cookie cutter.
