","I never thought the original Black Panther was anywhere near being the best solo Marvel movie, but I did enjoy it and T'Challa's character throughout his appearances. With that being said, when Chadwick Boseman sadly passed, I accepted that this franchise was doomed. I always believed that recasting T'Challa was the only way to go. It would've been incredibly hard to find a good replacement, but the character is very important to the Marvel universe. It is also simply too soon to pass the mantle of Black Panther on.

","As the last film in the fourth phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022) proves that there was no plan for this phase other than to clean up the remains of the Infinity War saga. To its credit, though, Wakanda Forever was burdened with finding an in-universe replacement for the titular Black Panther after the untimely passing of Chadwick Boseman.

","The only reason this is scoring a five from me is because of the good CGI, magnificent costumes and wonderful scene shots. Sadly none of that could save this terrible story which the director made it look like he was clueless as what to do with it. Not his fault really as it was woefully lacking in worth, tension, excitement, interest or quality in any way. My personal thoughts as I sat watching it (fighting hard with myself not to just switch it off) was that if they had no creative outstanding story for a sequel then Hollywood should have stopped just trying to cash in on what they thought would be a successful film franchise; whereas instead they made one of the most disappointing rubbish sequels of a film.",/review/rw9054025/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_Wakanda_Forever_2022

","Black Panther was a very welcome addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe back in 2018 and I was really looking forward to seeing the progression of that character. Obviously, with the tragic passing of Chadwick Boseman, that just wasn't possible anymore. I figured they would recast the character and continue forward, but they made the tough decision to write the death of the character into the film as well. For that reason, I was worried and relieved all at the same time. It seemed like an impossible task to make a sequel to such a beloved film, but not have the core character there the entire time.

14,5 December 2022,Darwinskid,," Frustrating.
","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever has ambitious goals but does not manage to meet them due to its overlong and sometimes unfocused screenplay that often feels very first draft level in craft and trying to have one too many political conversations to streamline linearly. It has its moments, with some very solid dramatic acting work by its performers, but on the whole it is an admirable effort but also a major step down in quality from its predecessor. I personally feel they should have waited on a sequel, and take more time to figure out what to do with the Black Panther and Wakanda as the Marvel Cinematic Universe was progressing post Endgame and after the unfortunate passing of Chadwick Boseman. The loss of T'Challa is seriously felt in this story, and I think most would have been fine with a recast just a few years later, the new actor might not have been on Mr. Boseman's level, but they could have still performed the part well and carry the franchise further. As is, the mantle gets passed, and its executed just okay, but it would have more impact if the story were more focused. Namor is a nice addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and is adapted fine, I would certainly like to see more of him in later installments. Still, you feel that the character probably should have come into the picture a lot earlier on, like in Phase Two or Phase Three at the least.",/review/rw9054025/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_Wakanda_Forever_2022
15,27 November 2022,fredschaefer-406-623204,6," Chadwick Boseman is sorely missed.
","If there is one thing BLACK PANTHER: WAKANDA FOREVER gets right is the reverence and respect it gives to the memory of Chadwick Boseman, taken from us way too soon after making the role of T'Challa, the Black Panther, totally and uniquely his own. From the opening montage, where he is the only Marvel superhero whose visage we see, onward throughout the film, his shadow looms over the characters, story, and action. We feel his missing presence in every scene. It is clear that director Ryan Coogler, the returning members of the cast from the first film, and the producers where dealt a very difficult hand when crafting a sequel and finding a way forward. Perhaps it was an impossible chore, perhaps there was no way they could have succeeded under these conditions, but the resulting film was just a disappointment as far as I'm concerned. In the absence Boseman, WAKANDA FOREVER fills the void by elevating the principle female characters to center stage, and having them face off against a threat from Prince Namor, the leader of an undersea race heretofore unknown to the MCU over the issue of vibranium, an all purpose element found in abundance in Wakanda (and the source of its technological superiority), and now for the first time, discovered outside the African nation on the ocean's floor. Coveted by other nations, this sets off a conflict when Namor demands that Wakanda do his dirty work for him, and eliminate the threat from the surface world. I don't fault the actresses-Letitia Wright, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, and the indomitable Angela Bassett-who totally give it their all, and clearly bring it. But the script goes heavy on the themes of female empowerment, anti-colonialism, and Afro-futurism that earn praise from mainstream film critics and pop culture commentators at the expense of the tension and conflict, and even humor that made the first film something special. A cameo by Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger in a dream sequence only served as a further reminder of what WAKANDA FOREVER was missing. At a running time of more than two and half hours, WAKANDA FOREVER works way too hard to generate some heat with its thin plot. Namor is played by Tenoch Huerta as another antagonist motivated by past injustice, so he never really feels like a Big Bad. And those wings on his heels look silly. Tweaking Namor's origin to make him and his undersea kingdom have a connection to the ancient Mayans, who escape Spanish oppression by ingesting vibranium, works, but giving all of them but Namor blue skin invokes unflattering comparisons to AVATAR (it didn't help that the trailer for James Cameron's latest epic played in the theater before WAKANDA FOREVER). There are some great action set pieces, something the MCU does well, but the resolution of the final battle between Princess Shuri and Namor is underwhelming. There are a few cameos, and I liked the interplay between Martin Freeman and Julia Louis-Dreyfuss. And was I the only one who thought Richard Schiff was just playing an older version of his character from THE WEST WING when he shows up as the Secretary of State?",/review/rw9054025/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_Wakanda_Forever_2022

","Depsite there being a few interesting aspects to this film, like a number of elements that seemed to have been borrowed from Ancient Greek mythology (namely the sirens and the winged feet), I have to admit that I found that this film was rather dull and boring.

30,12 November 2022,brentsbulletinboard,9," A Fitting Tribute
","At the risk of overstatement, it's hard not to be blown away by writer-director Ryan Coogler's ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever."" This is a vast improvement over its predecessor offering (2018), if not the best picture to ever come out of the Marvel Universe. It's the kind of film that shows comic book movies can indeed go beyond action sequences and endless explosions to offer viewers something more meaningful and substantial, a result capable of silencing critics like filmmaker Martin Scorsese, who blanketly contend that these releases are without artistic merit. What's more, this second outing in the franchise has undoubtedly saved it from oblivion after losing its lead character in the wake of its initial outing with the untimely death of protagonist Chadwick Boseman. In addition to telling a compelling story, this film provides a credible bridge to the future while fittingly serving as a respectful tribute to its fallen star, one that honors the actor in a way that the movie industry unfortunately never did. Its tactful, reverential treatment of this issue is sure to evoke an emotional response, if not a few tears, in a truly loving but not maudlin way. Beyond that, the narrative and character development in this installment are also a significant cut above the original, telling a more engaging story with deftly nuanced themes that make its predecessor look comparatively simple. It also features fine performances by its ensemble cast, particularly Letitia Wright, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, and, most notably, Angela Bassett in a genuinely Oscar-worthy portrayal. But what's most impressive is the film's handling of its principal themes, delving into concepts that action-adventure offerings rarely, if ever, do, and certainly not as capably addressed as here (making pictures like ""The Woman King"" appear somewhat amateurish by comparison). To be sure, there are a few elements that might have been handled better (the picture is a little too long, it underutilizes the talents of Winston Duke, and there are a few too many James Cameron-esque graphic and cinematic attributes reminiscent of ""Avatar"" (2009) and ""The Abyss"" (1989)), but these are minor shortcomings in comparison to everything else the picture has to offer. Of course, it's impossible to talk about this release without noting that it probably wouldn't have the same onscreen impact were it not for the tragic offscreen story that has sadly accompanied it, though the filmmakers truly deserve praise for their sensitive handling of this matter without giving in to cheap exploitation or sensationalism, results that may very well have occurred in lesser-skilled hands. It's truly comforting to see that the ""Black Panther"" franchise has managed to weather this storm and to do so as well as it has.

After the coffin arrives at a clearing, where it ceremoniously rises to the sky, we cut to an earnest, emotional montage of Boseman as T'Challa. The solemn, aching continuum of images soon forms the ""Marvel Studios"" logo, announcing that this is still a Marvel movie. And ""Wakanda Forever"" is all the worst for it. But writer/director Ryan Coogler and his co-writer Joe Robert Cole don't possess the same kind of freedom with this melancholy sequel. Some limitations aren't within their control, such as the tragic death of Boseman. The hulking script is chock-full of ideas and themes. Rather than fighting their common enemy (white colonists), two kingdoms helmed by people of color are pitted against each other (an idea that never thematically lands), and the film must delve into the cultural pain that still exists from the historical annihilation of Central and South America's Indigenous kingdoms. A major sea battle ensues, new, ropey gadgets are employed, and loose ends are inarticulately tied. Another montage dedicated to Boseman occurs, and while the film is messy, you're relieved that it begins and ends on the right foot. That is, until the saccharine post-credit scene. I'm not sure what Coogler was thinking. He had more weight on him for this movie than any filmmaker deserves. But when this scene occurred, I audibly groaned at what amounts to a weepy, treacly moment that's wholly unnecessary, emotionally manipulative, and partially unearned. It's one of the many instances where ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" might have its heart in the right place but is in the wrong mindset and in the worst space-at the center of a contrived cinematic universe-to mourn on its own terms.",/review/rw9054025/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_Wakanda_Forever_2022

At one point the music just glitches because they removed a scene late in postproduction, probably. It has women of color running everything: Black female Panther, Black female Ironman, Black female Black Widow, Black female Queen. It's not that it hurts the story in anyway, but it gives the impression that they dumped everything they had in this film just to make it not suck. I mean, they added Mexicans, too.

","Obviously this movie is a huge thing. Chadwick is a legend and will always be seen as the black panther. This movie was just so filler and boring with a pace that's way too slow for a 2 hour+ film. It's not a bad film it's just a long slog of a movie. Nothing big happens in the movie at all apart from the mantle passing of black panther, it's very empty. Compared to the first black panther it's a completely different tone and pace to it which wouldn't be a bad thing if the story was engaging. Shuri becoming the new black panther I expected due to comic knowledge and I'm happy with that and I thought her story was decent along with showing her dark side especially in her fight with Namor. All the performances were great and I liked Riri Williams as an addition to the MCU, whilst some of her scenes were stale and the suit looked like trash I'll stay open minded for her show. Namor was okay, he was cool to watch. Namor and his people let the story down as it was built up to be this huge war but ultimately led to nothing but boring and ugly fight scenes between everyone and this was in the whole movie too! Namor was interesting just a poorly written character mostly which was unfortunate. The post credit scenes were underwhelming and they did a fast and furious by naming a child after the character/person that died which was fine I guess but unnecessary. The comedy was great though even though it lacked which is what made it rewarding when it happened. The scenes honouring Chadwick were fantastic though leaving me to tear up with how connected I was along with the world to this person and character. Those scenes were special. Also the film ended the same as it started with empty threats of war between the two groups leaving no hype for the future and the overwhelming feeling of being unrewarding.

131,22 February 2023,dakotadickenson-83457,8," A film that pulled off the impossible
","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is one of the best projects of Phase 4 of the MCU and I was glad they saved this for last, unless you count the Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special. After the real life death of Chadwick Boseman, who played King T'Challa of Wakanda in the first Black Panther, it looked like this film was on the verge of not being made, but Ryan Coogler pulled off the impossible and made it work while also following key details from the comics. The film honors Chadwick Boseman in the best way that can be done and is probably one of the saddest movies of the MCU. Shuri played by Letitia Wright steps into the shoes as the lead character in this film and pulls it off successfully while using real life elements to fill in the shoes of her on screen brothers role. This is also hands down Angela Bassett's best role she's ever done as the current leader of Wakanda following King T'Challa's passing and as well as one of the best performances by an actor/actress in the MCU and superhero movies period. She steals the show in every single scene she is in and knows how to grab the audiences attention making her one of the standout characters of this film. Tenoch Huerta who played the villain Namor is phenomenal and one of my favorite villains currently in the MCU. He brought us a villain that wasn't always bad and always tried to do things for the best of his people, making him a villain that audiences alike can relate too. It was great to see some of the old cast from the first Black Panther again as well as newcomers such as Riri Williams Iron Heart. It's also worth noting that the visual effects on this movie were probably some of the best to come out of Phase 4. Overall, this is a powerful film mixed with real life elements that pulled off what was thought to be impossible to do, only to pull it off in the end in a big way.

Chadwick's death hit hard on everybody, but I still want to see the character's story and journey in the MCU, but I guess the studio see that Chadwick is irreplaceable, which is understandable, but I also think they should wait awhile to start production of this film. Ever since Phase 4 started, it has been overall mediocre to begin with. The only acceptable of good out of this phase was Spider-Man: No Way Home and Shang-Chi. The rest of the movies and Disney shows have potential with good moments in them, but it all falls flat with its writing, direction, and some weird agenda they have going on.

154,2 December 2022,theredsky,7," Black Panther: Wakanda Forever Review
","Phase 4 of the MCU really isn't that great in my opinion bar Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home but the writing for both of those is very weak at points. Wakanda Forever however stands way above the rest of Phase 4 and I'm really happy that Phase 4 ended this way. This film is an improvement over the first film in my opinion in almost every aspect. The visual effects while still off look better than the PS2 effects of the first movie. The characters here are all very well written and incredibly well acted. Angela Bassett gives probably one of the best performances in the entire series here and Letitia Wright does an amazing job as well. Wright probably has one of the best character arcs in the MCU as well. Watching her learn to process her grief over the death of her brother is heartbreaking. Her arc feels a lot more personal as does most of the rest of this film. To address the obvious, Chadwick Boseman's presence here is sorely missed but the film does an absolutly beautiful job at handling this. The film not really respects the character of T'Challa but also Chadwick as well. The first 10 minutes and last 5 address his departure and those last 5 minutes caused me to start crying. Tenoch Huerta does a great job as well and plays a great antagonist here although I do prefer Killmonger. Namor has an understandable motivation of protecting his people from being found on although he goes about it through the wrong way of attacking Wakanda. I struggle to call Namor a villain nor an anti-hero because of his motivation and his intentions to try and make peace at first. Ryan Coogler once again proves that he is easily one of the best directors in the MCU and the film just looks absolutely gorgeous. Easily one of the best looking films in the MCU and one of the best sounding. Ludwig Göransson's score is once again great although the music from the first film is just a little bit better. I did have some minor issues with the film though. I already mentioned the visual effects but the pacing here is definitely off. The first act (minus the first 10 minutes) speeds through everything before finally slowing down and the humor when it is used only works about 50% of the time although I do really like that this film MAJORLY cuts back on the typical MCU comedy. This is very easily one of the best entries in the MCU and I would definitely recommend watching this when you get the chance.",/review/rw9054025/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_Wakanda_Forever_2022

Yes he was a bit extreme but do you blame his fear especially considering the history of his people and when he noticed the rest of the world trying to get their paws in Wakanda's honey after T'challa and his dad went public with their nation .

","Black Panther Wakanda Forever is a fitting and touching tribute to Chadwick Boseman. You can tell that they purposely dialled down the usual MCU humour to give this movie the somber tone it needed. The memorial scenes at the beginning and ending of the movie are handled very well. They are respectful of his legacy and poignant. And although the beating heart of the first movie in Boseman isn't there, Letitia Wright still manages to pull off a rousing and impressive performance, stepping into Chadwick's shoes and taking up the mantle of The Black Panther. Another superb performance inside of this movie is Angela Basset as Queen Ramonda. With her scenes at the UN and the throne room being highlights. Tenoch Huerta is also very good as Namor. Who although is different from the comics is very interesting as a character. Another bright spot in the movie is the visuals. Coogler really nailed it here. There are many simply breathtaking shots especially in the underwater scenes and Wakandan scenes. Another strength is the side characters. Riri Williams played by Dominique Thorne is fun when on screen and it made me more excited for her Disney + show. As always, Winston Duke's M'Baku was very cool. And Martin Freeman returns again as Everett Ross and although he has a minor part to play in the movie's story, he is still enjoyable. Despite all these positives the movie definitely isn't perfect. It is overlong and perhaps too light on action (although when there is action it is done very well), the movie sometimes feels too slow-paced and it potentially could have devoted more of it's runtime to paying respect to Chadwick Boseman. Another odd thing I noticed was the designs of some of the characters and costumes. Some of them feel slightly derivative at times. Especially Namor's people, who look a lot like the people from Avatar. Which was especially funny since the cinema I watched it at played trailers for Way of the Water before the movie started. Another odd thing that I noticed was Ironheart's suit. It looks more like the Red Power Ranger suit or Samus's suit then a Iron Man style suit, with that being said though, it was nice to see some Iron Man style action again.",/review/rw9054025/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_Wakanda_Forever_2022

The biggest issue is the movie does not feel like a sequel to the first without Boseman at the helm. It also felt unnecessary to kill off the Queen. The inclusion of Riri Williams was odd, as she is an Iron Man type character shoved into an Black Panther film. With all that said, I still enjoyed it and did not have any major complaints.

","We all know Marvel has lots of money to spend and considering this is a 2 1/2 hour film I was expecting a good show but I was a little disappointed. At the time of writing this, this film has a higher rating than black adam which I just cannot understand. Black adam was funny and entertaining. This film has no humor whatsoever which is a shame. So it loses points for that. For the money that was clearly spent on this film I was disappointed. The first half of the film is introducing us to army 1. We already know wakanda which is army 2. Both talk in alien languages throughout most of the film and it is hard to follow the story as a result. I feel it would have made more sense if this was played out on a completely foreign alien planet which I just pretended it was most of the film. A lot of gibberish and there is a bit of action but nothing as entertaining as black adam provided. Why does army 2 invade army 1? I don't know. Maybe this was mentioned in the gibberish that I could not understand through half the film but whatever the reason, it was just a fake reason over a fake element called.vibranium. Nothing I could really relate to. I should really give this film a lower score but there was a lot of good flying spaceships... Anyway the enemies leader called Fishman was just a complete joke, and not in a funny way. It's a flying fish man like spider man who has pigeon wings to make him fly. Like what? Check it out and you will see what I mean. He has pigeon wings to make him fly. It's hilariously stupid. So I cannot relate to why this film has such a high rating at the time of writing this review. I have liked wakanda films so far but this one was just a let down. Wakanda has been portrayed as pretty much invincible, in charge of vibranium and the most advanced technology on this planet so what could marvel do to enhance their story? Not much to be honest but this just felt like an embarrassment. So yes they create a new invading army that feels the need to invade wakanda for what reason, I still don't know. Half way through the film once the fighting actually starts I thought, ok this must be the reason for the high rating but after a 5 minute fight that leads to nothing much there is then a lot of gibberish talking again, a big outrage, a bit more talking, a bit more talking, followed by more talking. What happens to fish man? Who knows - the talking is more important at this point and fish man loses his screen time. We are now approaching the end of the film and there is still more drama, over what? Not really sure. If you are a fan of tv soap drama's this might be right up your alley but if you like action films avoid this travesty. There is 5 minutes of action at about the 90 minute mark of the film that fizzles out into nothing but drama. The wakanda council convenes to plot a plan. The final battle takes place resulting in a big water sports spectable. Nothing you would expect from a 21st century marvel fim. Maybe one of those low budget horror films where a bunch of tourists get attacked by a giant shark. You know the type of film I mean. Anyway that pretty much concludes the film and my less than impressed review. Clearly others have enjoyed this more than me. The ending actually gets worse than I have revealed in my review but I will not give away marvels glorious final twist too much. Lets's just say for a fake battle the ending was the most pathetic ending I have seen in a film in the past decade along the lines of peace is more important than war.

An osm story and hype throughout, churi omg she is something and every charcter played their roles to perfection the iron heart and the transformation was the highlight cant ask more than this. Every scene at edge of the seat. I expected boseman atleast for one scene but cudnt find him in, but there is a huge surprise in the pc dont miss that i dont want to spoil that.

","The death of lead actor Chadwick Boseman from cancer was sad and shocking, and a big blow to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, many questioned if his character would be recast for the sequel, but director Ryan Coogler (Creed, Black Panther) went ahead with a story that incorporates this tragic loss. Basically, Shuri (Letitia Wright) is rushing to save the life of her brother, T'Challa, king of Wakanda, who is dying from an illness. She believes he can be cured by the ""heart-shaped herb"" and uses her technology to synthetically recreate the herb after it was destroyed by their cousin N'Jadaka aka Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan). But it is too late, T'Challa dies and all Wakanda come together for the funeral of their king, the Black Panther. One year later, a ship containing amounts of Vibranium are stolen. Wakanda is under pressure from nations of the world to gain access to the precious metal. After returning from a meeting at the United Nations, Queen Ramonda (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Angela Bassett) implores Shuri to continue her research on the heart-shaped herb, hoping to create a new Black Panther that will defend Wakanda. But grief-stricken Shuri refuses due to her belief that the Black Panther is a figure of the past. In the Atlantic Ocean, the CIA, and US Navy SEALs use a machine that can detect Vibranium to locate a potential source underwater. The expedition is attacked and all aboard are killed by a group of blue-skinned, water-breathing superhumans from Talokan, led by Namor (Tenoch Huerta). The CIA believe Wakanda to be responsible. Namor confronts Ramonda and Shuri, easily bypassing Wakanda's advanced security, and blames them for the Vibranium race. He gives them an ultimatum: deliver him the scientist responsible for the Vibranium-detecting machine, or Wakanda will be attacked. Shuri and Okoye (Danai Gurira), general of the Dora Milaje, learn from CIA agent Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman) that the scientist in question is MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) student Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne). Arriving at the university to confront Riri about her invention, the group is pursued by the FBI and then by Namor's warriors. In their battle, Okoye is defeated, and Shuri and Williams are taken underwater to meet Namor. Angered by Okoye's failure to protect Shuri, Ramonda strips her of her title as general and seeks out Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), who has been living in Haiti since the attack on Wakanda by Thanos. Namor shows Shuri the underwater kingdom of Talokan, which is rich with Vibranium, and has protected for centuries from discovery by the world. Namor is bitter at the surface world for enslaving the Maya civilization, he proposes an alliance with Wakanda against the rest of the world, threatening to destroy Wakanda if they refuse. Nakia helps Shuri and Riri escape, and Namor retaliates with an attack against Wakanda, during which Ramonda dies from drowning saving Riri. Namor vows to return with his full army, and the citizens of Wakanda relocate to the Jabari mountains for their safety. Meanwhile, Ross is arrested by his ex-wife, CIA director Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), for secretly exchanging classified intelligence with the Wakandans. Following the funeral of Ramonda, Shuri uses a remnant of the herb that gave Namor's people their superhuman abilities to reconstruct the heart-shaped herb. Confirming a high percentage of success, she swallows the synthetic herb containing her brother's DNA, and gains superhuman abilities. She meets N'Jadaka in the Ancestral Plane, who urges her to seek revenge. Shuri dons a new Black Panther suit and is accepted by the other Wakandan tribes as the Black Panther. Despite M'Baku (Winston Duke) urging for peace, Shuri wants vengeance on Namor for her mother's death and orders an immediate counterattack on Talokan. Preparing for battle, with Ayo (Florence Kasumba) assuming the position of general of the Dora Milaje, Shuri bestows the Midnight Angel armour upon Okoye, who in turn recruits Dora Milaje member Aneka (Chewing Gum's Michaela Coel) to join her. Riri joins the fight and aids the Wakandans in an Iron Man inspired high-powered mechanical exoskeleton suit. Namor and his warriors are lured by the Wakandans to the surface onto a seafaring vessel where a battle ensues. Shuri traps Namor in a fighter aircraft, intending to dry him out and weaken him. The pair crash onto a desert beach and fight, with Shuri gaining the upper hand as Namor weakens from drying out. But Shuri realises the similarities between their paths and implores Namor to yield, offering him a peaceful alliance. Namor accepts, and the battle ends. Namor's cousin, Namora (Mabel Cadena), is upset at Namor surrendering, but he assures her that the new alliance will one day allow them to conquer the surface world. Riri returns to MIT, leaving her suit behind, while Okoye rescues Ross from captivity. Shuri plants more heart-shaped herbs to ensure the future of the Black Panther mantle. While Shuri is away, M'Baku steps forward to challenge for the throne. Shuri visits Nakia in Haiti where she burns her funeral ceremonial robe in accordance with Ramonda's wishes, allowing herself to finally grieve T'Challa. In a mid-credits scene, Shuri learns that T'Challa has a son, Toussaint (Divine Love Konadu-Sun); his mother Nakia has been raising him in secret, and his Wakandan name is T'Challa. Also starring Isaach De Bankolé as River Tribe Elder, Danny Sapani as Border Tribe Elder, Dorothy Steel as Merchant Tribe Elder, Trevor Noah as Griot, Zola Williams as Zola, Richard Schiff as US Secretary of State, and Anderson Cooper as himself. Wright as the new lead is fantastic as the brainy and brave sister character, Bassett and Gurira are great support as the nation leaders, Thorne is good as the young scientist, Freeman is fine in his little screen time, and Huerta does well as the villain. From the opening Marvel logo to the story itself, this serves as a tribute to Boseman, with a melancholic emotional feeling almost all throughout, but it also works well as a female-driven story, with some marvellous special effects and spectacular fights, it is a terrific superhero fantasy action. It won the Oscar for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for Best Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Original Song for ""Lift Me Up"" by Rihanna (it was also nominated the Golden Globe), and Best Visual Effects.

In one annoying scene, she is charging less intelligent students a fee for helping them with their papers, and of course none are black. The humorous part is all Wakandans speak with an accent except Killmonger, who is from Wakanda as noted in the actual Marvel comics.

","""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is of course the long-awaited sequel to the incredibly successful ""Black Panther"" film from 2018 that became one of the most socially relevant films of its year and also one of the big players during the then following awards season. I think it is safe to say that in both fields this movie here will not make equally huge waves as the previous one, but from my perspective this sequel here I'd say is maybe even the superior movie from the two. Many will disagree and as you can see from my rating I was also not blown away by it, but I enjoyed it and I was definitely nicely entertained. There were even parts when I considered giving the film an even higher rating and 4 stars out of 5 or 8 out of 10 I could also say is nothing that really happens extremely often for me. I'd still say a 60% approval is fitting and accurate now. Of course, you did not have to do without the characters for four years since 2018 as there were other Marvel films in-between where the characters were included. The director and also writer here is again Ryan Coogler of course. I see he has worked on quite a few Black-themed films for years now, so I'd be curious to see him also for once shoot a movie away from race-related issues. Just like his co-writer Joe Robert Cole has done in the past for example. He even made a very White film on one occasion and he is also a director himself, but with this film here, the directing was all up to Coogler and today we will mostly talk about this film. It is an extremely long movie, even for Marvel standards at over 160 minutes including credits. The biggest challenge they had was basically deal with the untimely death of Chadwick Boseman, the Black Panther from the first film. I liked what they did with that. The film was a decent tribute and while references to Boseman in the film in terms of the plot were frequent, it never felt forced or like fake tearjerker material. For me personally, the opening was the most touching aspect maybe, how they included the Marvel opening they always use as a tribute to Boseman only. That almost turned my eyes a little wet there, also because it was in black-and-white. May he rest in peace.",/review/rw9054025/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_Wakanda_Forever_2022

","Well it looks like Marvel butchered yet another well established character. I've read Namor and watched the early cartoon versions of him for decades. Every iteration of his portrayal were consistent throughout the years... until the MCU's version came out. Much like DC's Ocean Master, he was a haughty self absorbed egoist with a high-nobility way of speech to go along with it. This MCU version is basically as introverted, boring, and quiet as possible. When he threatened to kill a person or destroy the world, he said it with the gusto of reading the dictionary. The infamous ""Imperius Rex"" got replaced with some gibberish I will not bother to learn. Sure the action scenes were all good but that's on the CGI team, not the actor himself. The Atlanteans as a whole got nerfed to hell in this universe, much like the Black Order was in Infinity Wars. The Black Order in the comics were each world destroyers. Proxima Midnight's spear had the weight of a sun that she could lift and throw it at will. They slew armies of Thors like nothing in Battleworld. Yet Black Widow, a normal human, blocked her strikes without becoming a pile of fleshy goo during the Wakanda battle. The same kind of nerf was applied to the Atlanteans in this movie. Even average joe Atlanteans can lift 4 tons because they live in the crushing depths of the oceans. Atlantean warriors are 10 tonners, basically as strong as an elephant. Attuma is an established 60 tonner yet Okoye, yet another normal human, blocked his strikes in fights, without an Iron Woman suit. So I guess either Okoye can block the charge of 6 elephants as well, or Attuma got nerfed to hell in this movie. I'm not even going to touch on how Namor, a 200,000 tonner got beat by Shuri's version of BP. Even weakened, he's as strong as Attuma in the comics and should be able to slap Shuri silly with ease. If DC can portray their Atlanteans accurately, why can't Marvel? DC's average Atlanteans can run through walls and destroy boulders with a punch. Marvel's Atlanteans gets flung and beat by humans. On the Wakanda storyline side, it was ok. The strongest acting came from Angela Bassett.

Hermes the merman who decides in order to attack the surface he will wage war on the Wakandans (and kill their Queen) in order to force them to be his allies is simply the stupidest plot line ever produced in a Marvel film (and that is setting the bar very low, e.g., the She-hulk attorney-at-law dumpster fire of a movie). The writers should resign in embarrassment and repay whatever they were paid. And nearly 3 hours of this dreck in which the new Black Panther does not appear until 2 HOURS(!) into this diarrhea of a film, is simply unconscionable. Shame on Disney for such a piss-poorly written, edited and directed film.

","I'm not some Marvel fanboy. In fact, I don't like to be a fan of anything. Therefore, I was honest when I reviewed Taika Waititi's sloppy, even disastrous, Thor: Love and Thunder. But Wakanda Forever is another success for Marvel Studios. Seeing this film was the best experience that I had in a theater in a long time. When the film came to an end, I thought that it's now my favorite film from Phase Four of the MCU. But, after thinking some more about this, I decided that Spider-Man: No Way Home and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness are on par with Wakanda Forever. Some people have claimed that Kevin Feige has been giving directors more creative freedom since Phase Four began. If this is indeed the case, I understand why the output of Phase Four was uneven when it comes to quality. Wakanda Forever has director Ryan Coogler's style all over it. First of all, there aren't many action scenes in the film because it seems to me that Coogler prefers to focus on character development. This doesn't become a problem in the film because the performances of the actors (especially of Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett, Michael B. Jordan, and Tenoch Huerta) are good, the cinematography is good (for a modern film), the direction is good, and the music is good. Therefore, the scenes of people talking aren't a snoozefest here. I cared about Shuri's struggle more than I cared about T'Challa's struggle in Black Panther (2018). It seems that Shuri intentionally puts on a suit that looks similar to N'Jadaka's suit from Black Panther because she wants to get revenge. I do like the first Black Panther film, which contains more action scenes, but I like Wakanda Forever more because it's directed better and because it's more polished. Perhaps the reasons why this is the case are because the film has a bigger budget ($250 million) and because production and filming took longer. Or the reason could have been because Feige was more involved in making Wakanda Forever as good as possible. I think that the filmmakers and the actors wanted to make a fitting tribute to Chadwick Boseman, who died in 2020, but they also didn't want the film to be a waterworks show. The country of Wakanda is a more believable place in Wakanda Forever than in Black Panther. Since Wakanda Forever is a Marvel Studios film, it might gross more than $1 billion by the end of its theatrical run. Its popularity also means that it has already gotten plenty of hate from the haters that hate its ""woke"" content and plenty of praise from the lovers that love the MCU. I'm neither a hater nor a lover of the MCU. I simply like it because it's a good film and because it's another fantastic addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",/review/rw9054025/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_Wakanda_Forever_2022

I breve it's got to a point that these Marvel franchise films are just so complacent that they feel they can just churn out any old story, regardless to how poor it is and expect a very healthy profit and sadly this does seem to be true.

A fireside chat late one night doesn't quite go to plan though, when they are introduced to an interloper. ""Namor"" (Tenoch Huerta) arrives to ask their help to thwart the Americans who nave managed to design a machine that can trace vibranium, and this has put his hitherto unknown population of underwater, Mesoamerican, people at risk. Either they help him to track down the scientist who created this or there could be war. The Princess and her general head to Massachusetts where they track down a college student who is almost as much of a whizz-kid as ""Shuri"". The FBI are on soon their trail and skedaddle they must, straight into the arms of the waiting ""Talokan"" who take them to their beautiful watery homeland where we learn just how they evolved. Somewhat narked, the Queen wants her daughter back and that action sows the seeds for a conflict between the two nations that, well, you can guess the rest. Sadly, that's the problem here. Despite a really strong and vibrant performance from Wright and some very fine production values, there is precious little story here. It is far, far, too long to sustain the thin plot and the conflict engineered between the two races is flawed in more ways than an US Congressional election. The pace is really slow, the combat scenes could have been choreographed by Sir Matthew Bourne - or by a Wakandan cheerleader at their equivalent of the ""Superbowl"" - and the supporting characters aren't on screen long enough to give Miss Wright enough help to wade through the frequent tedium. I wasn't helped by Huerta's very thick accent which made his dialogue nigh-on impossible to comprehend at times and the denouement screamed sequel so loudly that I forgot that I'd long given up on any jeopardy at the end two hours ago. There is a bit of character tragedy, character loyalty and thankfully Martin Freeman's (""Ross"" - why does he need an American accent?) appears but sparingly as we go along but Marvel must stop taking the audience for granted. They have to realise that their gorgeous Avatar-esque visual effects and technical wizardry are not going to entertain us indefinitely if the stories continue to deliver so weakly. Great to look at, a few power-ballads from the soundtrack and Wright is certainly a stylish and classy star - otherwise, this is a film nobody will remember in two years time, I'll bet!",/review/rw9054025/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_Wakanda_Forever_2022

A sequel was a no brainer and everyone was quickly regathered and work commenced, however, everything changed with the sudden and tragic death of Boseman from stomach cancer. Many questions surrounded the status of the now in flux film.

","This is a fitting tribute to Chadwick Boseman. It's not overly done, and I feel it's respectful enough, although I'm not entirely satisfied about the cause of the character's death. I agree the character of T'challa shouldnt be replaced, despite Boseman's brother insisting otherwise. There are things I like about the movie, like how Shuri doesnt take the mantle of Black Panther too early, and how she doesnt automatically become queen opon her mother's death. I also like that she is conflicted when she first took the herb. Many to like, but there are some things that I feel make this movie feel average. First, the heart shaped herb. Shuri only succeeded in making the synthetic herb after sampling the properties of the bracelet given by Namor because the fiber is made of ""vibranium rich plant."" If I'm not mistaken, Wakanda is pretty rich in vibranium itself. Second, the MCU has always had one big problem: the villains. Other than Thanos, Loki and Kilmonger, the villains in MCU are pretty weak. Namor is no exception. Third, Shuri led her people to a massacre because she wanted revenge, and the Wakandans still feel she's fit to be the Black Panther? She doesnt even feel guilty about it afterwards. At least make her face the repercussions of her actions and choices. And fourth, Riri Williams aka Ironheart. In the comics, she stole the iron man tech, which I dont like but at least makes sense. In the movie, she made the whole thing from scrap. How the hell did she have the knowledge, materials, and technology to create it from the ground up? I get she's portrayed as a genius but she has neither Stark tech nor the fund. Maybe I just dont like the character. Overall, I give it a 7 because it's a fitting tribute to Boseman and it's still much better than recent Marvel efforts like Thor Love and Thunder and especially the Disney+ series.",/review/rw9054025/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_Wakanda_Forever_2022

Adding to the drama is the world's attempts to usurp Wakanda's hold on vibranium, the appearance of the mutant Namor (masterfully now rooted in Aztec mythology) who fears land dwellers will come to his kingdom seeking the powerful ore & also ReRe Williams, Dominque Thorne, a young genius following in the footsteps of Tony Stark, who's constructed a vibranium detector which has been co-opted by the American government which puts her on a death list penned by Namor. All of this climaxes on a troop barge where the seemingly insurmountable ocean dwellers are spurred back from the remaining Wakandan forces (after a flooding decimates the nation) where a Black Panther stands tall once again to not only right some wrongs but keep the world in their respective corners. Ryan Coogler again proves himself to be the biggest kid on the cinematic block by weaving a nearly 3 hour narrative into something thoughtful, inspiring & ultimately soul searching as viewers grapple w/the multitude of emotions being explored here.",/review/rw9054025/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_Wakanda_Forever_2022
341,11 November 2022,Paragon240,7," Wakanda Forever was an earnest film that tackled some tough themes and honored its hero well but got bogged down introducing vast new worlds and complicated characters.
","Wakanda Forever left me with mixed emotions. The respect and love paid to the legacy of Chadwick Boseman were heartfelt, meaningful, and sincere. The movie wisely grappled with the aftermath of T'Challa's passing on his family and nation. This subject matter created excellent opportunities to dive deeper into characters like Shuri, Nakia, and even M'Baku. Instead, Wakanda Forever primarily served as a vehicle to introduce Namor and Talokan. The film rightfully embraced a more somber tone as it dealt with themes of loss and legacy, but the mournful spirit caused the plot to sag and drag along throughout most of the runtime. Winston Duke offers the little levity the movie had. The cast delivered exceptionally, with Angela Bassett's performance as the true standout. I liked the movie, but the melancholy approach made it more difficult to really enjoy, and the introduction of Namor and his threat to Wakanda chewed up so much of the story that it was difficult to bring closure to characters struggling with loss and heartbreak satisfyingly.",/review/rw9054025/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_Wakanda_Forever_2022

","Just like with the first movie, there's a lot about Wakanda Forever that I really, really liked. There's some amazing worldbuilding and powerhouse performances here, the story is enthralling, and the antagonist is about as perfect as you can get in the way he was developed and the role he served. The score by Ludwig Goransson was once again on-point, the realisation of Talokan was fantastic, and every reverence to Chadwick Boseman was respectful and heartbreaking in equal measure. This is a movie that really cared about the legacy of its late star, and was aware of the love and admiration he had earned. But unfortunately, also like the first movie, there was a bunch about Wakanda Forever that I wasn't as much of a fun of. It was too long, filled with too much faff, it was so badly lit certain scenes were almost unwatchable, and they put their bets on the wrong leading actor going ahead. And yet I'm eager to see the effect this movie has on the wider MCU going forward. It did lay the groundwork for a lot of upcoming projects, even if it was to the film's overall detriment. And if you ignore all of that the core elements of the film are essential viewing for any Marvel fan. Wakanda Forever somehow managed to simultaneously be one of the MCU's highest peaks, as well as one of its lowest ditches. And for that I fall on an entertaining 7/10 that remains an improvement on the first film. Huerta and Bassett may be enough on their own to earn an 8 though.

The almost all female ensemble on the side of Wakanda delivered really great performances and the Namor was also depicted in fascinating way, that will probably make him one of the most interesting villain/anti-heroes of the whole franchise.

355,2 February 2023,MoviesWithX,6," A movie that works better in parts than in its entirety.
","I knew this movie was not going to be as enjoyable as the first given the loss of the late Chadwick Boseman. Every movie that he's not a part of from here on out will suffer because of his untimely death. However, this movie, despite being watchable, is not a movie that I think I would want to watch through its entire run time again. I didn't hate the movie, and I have good things to say about it, but it also falls into some of the exact same Marvel trappings that they've been stuck in for a while that have had me kind of jaded with them. First, I feel that everyone gave mostly great performances in this film. A lot of attention is obviously on Angela Bassett right now (who won a Golden Globe for her performance and has received her second Oscar nomination and is expected to win) and she's fantastic, but I feel that the main standout in this movie in my opinion when she wasn't on-screen was Danai Gurira as Okoye. I thought she had the best humor in the movie and I thought she had the best individual action scenes. Letitia Wright is very good as Shuri once again, and Winston Duke as M'Baku is great to see again. Lupita Nyong'o was also wonderful in her small doses. Tenoch Huerta was fine as Namor. I had no issue with him. While I'm still on the positives of things, I also thought that this movie once again had terrific production design, and I enjoyed a lot of the exterior shots. I don't know if they actually shot all of these shots on location when they were in different parts of the world (probably not) but those parts looked nice. Great costumes as well once again. And now, I'm going to get on to the things that I don't like so much. There are two characters in this movie that I don't think really needed to be in it: Riri Williams and even less so, whoever the character was that Julia Louis-Dreyfus played. I thought the actress that played Riri Williams did a fine job but her inclusion in this film was literally for nothing except to say ""Hey, welcome to the MCU"" because she's getting a Disney+ show sometime this year. It's just a vehicle for her. The Julia Louis-Dreyfus character was in ""Black Widow"" (didn't see it) from what I've heard and even with the few scenes she had here, I found her kind of annoying and not funny. She just felt like she was written into this movie just to crowd Martin Freeman's character, despite what her job is. In Martin Freeman's introductory scene, he's out running and he's swatting a bug out of his face or what he thinks is a bug. That's how I felt about JLD's character in this. Their inclusions overall is an issue I guess you could say is why I'm tired of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, because they won't just let the movie be contained enough to focus on what they're doing. They just have to remind you that ""Hey, this is someone else that Marvel made and you're going to see them again later. It's all connected."" I don't care. Focus on what you're doing right now. Namor as a villain is honestly kind of boring and Talokan does not look nearly as cool as Wakanda. You really don't even need the comparison. It just doesn't look all that great by itself to me. And also the music in my opinion by Ludwig Goransson was a disappointment this time around. There's hardly anything that I'd want to go back and listen to later. Also, I've become aware of how awful Marvel tends to treat their visual effects artists, and it's a real shame. And I mean that for their sakes, not the films. I don't endorse it whatsoever, but I'm simply talking about the work here as it is in the finished film. I feel like once you seen one big Marvel set piece, you've seen them all now. The scene when Namor is in Wakanda felt to me like I was watching any other Marvel movie, from a visual effects standpoint. It's like it's just automatically boring now to watch some of these scenes. And they for some reason in this movie incorporated the use of slow-mo a few times. No need for that. And the battle at the end has some of the same issues too, aforementioned and these to follow. Instead of showing one main scene go on, they have to cut back and forth between two other things going on at the same time. Granted, Marvel movies are not the first to do that, but I'm honestly getting really sick of this because I just feel like I can see it coming from a mile away now. Let me see what is happening. Also, the movie like a lot of movies these days isn't long because it knows what to do with the length, but rather it's just long just to be long. I don't have a problem with long movies as long as you use your runtime well. ""The Batman"" in my mind used its runtime well. But I wasn't really into this that much, especially when Shuri was in Talokan. There are good scenes in this, and I particularly like the ending of this movie as well as the mid-credits scene. But at the end of the day this movie to me is at its best, just good to decent moments instead of ""I can't wait to see this movie again"". Watching clips online or something is a better way of experiencing it. I'm not holding the passing of Chadwick Boseman against this movie and I knew I wasn't going to like this movie as much without him being a part of it, but also I'm not so sure about the direction they went in either. They should've recast him.",/review/rw9054025/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_Wakanda_Forever_2022

357,22 November 2022,hfreinoso,7," Honestly... Marvel/Disney should have recast T'Challa
","Black Panther Wakanda Forever was a movie I was hesitant to watch because, as many know, Chadwick Boseman has passed away from cancer, and it was hard to know that Kevin Feige was NOT going to recast the character and instead kill off T'Challa. And I have a massive problem with that because we have yet to explore the nature of T'Challa, and the story should have continued what Boseman started. And not kill the character just because the actor died. So Ryan Coogler had a tough job changing the new script and making a new story, and while I respect what he does and all the movies he writes and directs are exceptional; So I can expect to see, a movie with full 100% of heart that he cares. And of course, he does put his heart and soul. However, sadly, I am one of those people who wanted them to recast T'Challa than have him die in the universe. I wish they'd done this story as a show instead of a movie because there were so many elements that just didn't get enough time to be developed. Shuri simply has no agency for most of the film. We don't have time to see if she's mourning the loss of her brother, trying to deny the grief, struggling with the concept of having to someday lead her people or working through expectations put in place by her mother. We get little glimpses of these ideas, but not enough time to explore any of them. As a result, Shuri is just kinda ""there"" while the plot revolves around her, which sucks since she's the main character. I like how much more mature she is than in the first movie. She was better here and I did enjoy seeing her on a journey to find herself with her religious beliefs. Her questioning religion is a sight to see and needed more to explore. I did love Tenoch Huerta as Namor, he is brilliant as Namor, however, I still wish it was Atlantis and was their version of Atlantis that rivals Aquaman. Angela Bassett, I have nothing to say but she was the best part of this movie, and I did enjoy the performance she gave, but to me, she didn't need to die. I wanted her to continue the story of a struggle Queen. Riri Williams played by Dominique Thorne didn't work for me. I don't know what it is, but to me, I feel like we didn't need her, and she was nothing but a plot device for the movie and the story. And we don't even know why Wakanda wants to protect her if she is a random nobody, with just brains. Again, it's gotten so lazy to see someone with the gift of knowledge, but she is quite a one-dimensional character. Overall the movie is fine to me; I feel like if they kept the original story (Where T'Challa returns from the dead and he had to continue his journey as king and the story with him against Namor would have been miles better.) But again that's just me. 7/10. Still respect Ryan Coogler for what he did with this film.",/review/rw9054025/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_Wakanda_Forever_2022

Action sequences and CGI are Marvel-level polish we are used to, although the ultra slick transformer style suits make me yearn for early Iron Man movies ""raw"" look and feel.

","With the tragic passing of Chadwick Boseman, the story for this movie needed to find a way to pass on the torch and honour him and this story does all of that to a certain extent. The story for this movie is unlike any other Marvel movie we've seen so far. There's so much raw emotion in this movie that will make everybody say either I'm not crying, you're crying or someone's cutting onions in here.

But honestly, nothing could save the second part of this movie's story from not being the slowest part of this movie. This movie is 2 hours and 41 minutes long and honestly, it didn't need to be that long. There's a lot of filler in this movie that easily could've been removed and nothing would've been missed. But at the end of the day, this movie just didn't feel like an MCU movie. There weren't that many jokes being shoved down your throat constantly or some slapstick just because. This movie just felt like a movie honouring a man who was lost way too early. This all can be traced back to one man who's Ryan Coogler, the writer and director. Ryan Coogler understood that once Chadwick Boseman had passed this movie had to honour him and his impact and did that flawlessly. Those who saw this movie either having not seen a previous Marvel movie with Black Panther in it could still understand the impact Chadwick Boseman had on those around him.

","I liked 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' and gave it a 7/10. The acting remained strong, with notable performances from the cast. The music added depth to the film's emotional resonance, and the casting was generally well-done, introducing new characters seamlessly. Cinematography showcased the vibrant world of Wakanda beautifully. However, the direction faced the challenge of honoring Chadwick Boseman's legacy, resulting in a somewhat fragmented narrative. The writing had moments of brilliance but struggled to balance multiple storylines. The film's strength lies in its dedication to exploring the legacy of Wakanda, but it also grapples with the weight of expectations, which occasionally hampers its flow and cohesiveness.",/review/rw9054025/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_Wakanda_Forever_2022

The introduction of Wakanda was a visual spectacle. Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan both give transcendent performances in the film. So, what do you do for the sequel? How can you recapture the magic of seeing Wakanda for the first time? And most importantly, how do you make a Black Panther movie, when Black Panther died? The tragic death of Chadwick Boseman undoubtably threw a wrench into the original planned sequel. The world may have lost an all-time great actor, Ryan Coogler lost a good friend. The question became, would making a Black Panther 2 be in poor taste. To the movie's credit, they did a solid job playing tribute to the late great Panther. Certainly much better than they did in the other Panther film, ""Trail of the Pink Panther"" (1982).

","""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is a beautiful and poignant film about grief made by grieving people. I adored this film, not just for how well it honours and continues the legacy of the great Chadwick Boseman, but also how it truly felt like a natural progression from the first film. Ryan Coogler really had his work cut out for him with this film, and frankly was put in quite the impossible situation with the passing of Boseman. I am blown away at how skillfully he overcame these challenges and pivoted the story to a place that is obviously different from what we would all expect coming out of the first ""Black Panther"", and yet feels like a very natural and logical next step at the same time. Not only that, but this also feels like a return to form for the MCU after so long; this is the type of Marvel movie I fell in love with. Don't get me wrong, I have still liked (and in some cases, loved) most of Phase 4, but this film is easily the best Marvel has been since ""Endgame"". While my personal favourite of phase 4 still remains ""No Way Home"", this is a very close second to that. Films like ""Endgame"" and ""No Way Home"" were absolute triumphs, but Wakanda Forever is MCU's most beautiful, meaningful and soulful movie.

The motivation of the antagonist was blurry and unclear. I understand the needed pivot when Chadwick Boseman Died, may he rest in peace, but this was definitely not the way to go. The main antagonist Namor's motivation to kill a 19 year old college student that made a machine that could find vibranium for a college project is totally out of character of a king. The reason why he decides this is ""to protect his people"" and yet in the end he puts all of them in danger and the line of fire just for this girl who made the tech for a COLLEGE PROJECT. It's absolutely ridiculous and reckless. If he had been a king all this time he would never do something with so much risk for such little reward. Not to mention Suri offered to help him and offer her forces if they agreed to leave her alone, WHICH WAS A PERFECT DEAL, considering that exactly how it all ended.

Namor's mother wasn't human. As for the fear of using Atlantis, why? So what if DC used it as well? Why hasn't Marvel comics stopped losing it? And the actor playing Namor wasn't that convincing. He should have hit the gym a little more, and lost that goatee. The only time Namor had a beard was in the excellent Maestro series. They needed to put more thought into the origins of he and his people. Also was anyone surprised that the wristband fibers would enable Shuri to become the new Black Panther? I wasn't since it was telegraphed a mile away. I'm glad that Nakia and Winston Duke's characters survived. I was disappointed that there was no mid-credits scene, but perhaps there wasn't a reason yet. All in all, like all of phase 4, this was disappointing. It needed far better pacing.

","Surprisingly unemotional film. Black Panther 2 without the Black Panther is Disney Marvel's biggest folly yet. Delay and recast were the way to go with this sequel. Way too long running time to sit through a plot so boring and incoherent. So focused on current day and forgot to put the brakes on the director and writers throwing everything up the wall and using what sticks. The Namor character was so far removed from the classic origins of the old Marvel comics, he just came across as the weakest antagonist in the MCU with a poor backstory. The Shuri character is less annoying in this one than she was in the 1st Black Panther film but nevertheless, unable to carry the weight of the film. Angela Bassett was ok as the Queen. A fantastic actress that was given a poor plot and reasoning to go against the wishes of Namor that sparked the tensions and war. The Dora Milaje female warriors were even more insufferable this time round than ever before, quite frankly on this evidence, they'd beat the old Avengers and Thanos in one afternoon the way the director has amped them up with nothing more than carry shields and extendable staffs. The worst character in the film - Riri Williams aka ""Ironheart"", the teenage 19-year-old genius from the age of 3 first built her own powered Iron suit??? In this film she yet another Disney heroine with a sulky bad attitude that knows everything, a well-used and tired Disney trope at this point. The two scenes dedicated to the late great star Chadwick Boseman were exploitive at best. Of course, I understand the cast and crew wishing to pay tribute to their former cast member, but what was served just didn't hit me in the feels the way the film wishes it did. Everyone has said it already, they should've recast the Black Panther role instead of replacing him.

Every time there is a build up to what should be a typical MCU action scene the mood shifts downwards with misplaced and superfluous dialogue. I've been to see this film twice already to see if the pacing really was an issue, or whether my expectations were too high - but I've concluded that Act III really is a chore to get through..It was always going to be a difficult story to tell, but I think if some of the scenes were rearranged and dialogue cut to really build up to the climax of the film we'd be seeing one of the absolute best films in the MCU.",/review/rw9054025/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_Wakanda_Forever_2022

","""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is a movie with a more mature theme than many others in the Marvel Universe, touching on the theme of emotional loss and overcoming it, although jokes and incompetent dialogue are also added that break that maturity narrative in a wrong way. The script draws on the history of Wakanda from an African perspective as seen before and adds the world of Namor with a Mexican perspective from its Mayan period, mixing mythology and futuristic fictional technology in a successful way. The evolution of Shuri's character is deep and the introduction of Namor's character is interesting, but the script is not exempt from being repetitive and making the film unnecessarily long. The CGI special effects feature elements that are well done and others that look quite fake. The editing work is very good and emphasizes the central theme already mentioned above, the loss of a loved one. The cinematography is excellent in the underwater scenes, but in the scenes above the water it becomes ordinary. Letitia Wright's performance is powerful, while Tenoch Huerta proves to be a good actor and Lupita Nyong'o fails to fully convince her character.

Also, the fight scenes were seemingly very accurate, well the whole movie seemed to be extremely accurate in all of its writing, character-wise (especially with the representations of African cultures) and violence-wise.

It's overlong and unlike its predecessor I thought the movie was visually very bland and boring. There's no memorable scenes from a visual perspective and much of the action was done in a cookie-cutter way. I was especially dissapointed with Talokan's look, it should be pretty hard to make an ancient and powerful underwater empire look boring and bad but they sure as hell accomplished it. It seems like a lot of the more interesting plot points are left incomplete and feel forced at the end. I liked Shuri's struggle with embracing traditions and with facing her brother's death and how her character made us doubt if she was actually going to kill Namor.

","Firstly, the shoes that Ryan Cooglar(the director) had to fill must have been hard especially because there are people who want to replace Chadwick Boseman as well people who do not want Chadwick Boseman replaced. And I heard they completed the plans for this movie with chadwick Boseman as Black Panther but after his death they had change plans. If this was really true then it must be tough. So I kept my expectations really low for this movie and it was not bad. Firstly the screenplay was written poorly. Don't get me wrong, most characters(not all) were great but the dialogue needs work. Certain things in this movie did not make sense(not gonna say which ones as it will be a spoiler if I do). The actor who played Namor I felt was great at certain parts(as he sounded intimidating a bit in certain scenes) and other scenes he just felt like a normal dude and did not sound intimidating although that was they were going for. Shuri's character development was only not bad. Besides Namor another character(iron heart) was introduced(she definitely needs a lot of work on her character-she is basically a super smart character with literally almost no flaws and she might just be the smartest character in the mcu and her character in all honesty was just boring).

","Out of the superhero hype lately, the Black Panther comics have not received the attention they deserve. For the idea behind the comics themselves is smart and underrated. It is sometimes dismissed as just a token diversity attempt, a lazy attempt at inclusion. The same way they make a supergirl for superman and such. However, the Wakanda setting is well thought of and adds a sociopolitical commentary that is philosophical rich. In the context of postcolonialism it uses it's fantastical world as a thought experiment. Asking the question of what would have happened if there was a secret African nation hidden from the world that is more advanced technologically and socially than any Western power. Should they use this power to unite disenfranchised and marginalized Africans around the world making a new world power? Should they share their technology and resources with the rest of the world given the history of colonization and imperialism. However, the most prominent question is the matter of vengeance, if these hidden nations had the power to destroy and subjugate the previous imperial powers, should they exact this revenge?",/review/rw9054025/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_Wakanda_Forever_2022

","This was much better than I thought it would be. Despite Boseman's passing, the movie does not feel like it was hacked together or that anything was unintentional. They made it feel like this was the plan all along, which I'm really impressed by. This is really just a movie about Shuri's character arc, so that's all I'm going to talk about. As with most Marvel, the action, CGI, and humor are decent. The third act is a little disappointing action-wise, but it's fine. It's decent Marvel. Shuri's character arc is incredible. Basically, the point of this movie is that, following T'Challa's death, Shuri has two choices. She can either become her brother, not let her anger consume her, and move on, or she can become Killmonger and burn the world down in anger. The acting is very effective here, and I thought it went really well. If that was the whole movie, I would've given it a much better rating. The problem is the villain. Namor's inclusion in the movie not only makes very little sense, but also corrupts Shuri's arc. Namor gives Shuri an ultimatum. She can either help him destroy the whole world, or Wakanda can be the first place to be exterminated. Right off the bat, that makes no sense. Namor has nothing against Wakanda. People loved Killmonger because he was a sympathetic yet charismatic and ruthless villain. Namor is not sympathetic. Yes, he has a tragic backstory, but rather than ""kill slaveowners"" or ""kill the Spanish,"" his motivation is now ""kill everyone"" and then becomes ""kill Wakanda."" He's basically just a mass murderer with no clear motivation, which is not entertaining. You don't get a sense that he has some sort of coherent goal or vision, whereas Killmonger had both of those things. Namor kind of just wants to kill people. As a villain, it's really disappointing. But the bigger problem is that Shuri's choice is no longer hers to make. Namor has artificially injected himself into that choice. He makes it so that if she doesn't help him, Wakanda dies. Putting ridiculous stakes into her choice detracts from what made it so great. The point is that the stakes were relatively low and that it was about what kind of person she wanted to be. Namor turned a character arc into a movie arc and, as a result, sucked the life out of it, making it far less interesting. So I think Marvel constructed a fantastic character arc, but their insistence on including a villain rather than pulling an Inception and having it be a character-driven experience with no villain really hurt them.",/review/rw9054025/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_Wakanda_Forever_2022

","There's a trace of a good movie somewhere in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Immediately, the movie focalizes on the loss of Chadwick Boseman, and pays homage to him through a distressing yet powerful sequence. Then the actual movie starts, and it gets mediocre pretty quickly. To my memory, the MCU has never been more dull, more visually boring: the cinematography didn't give us the grandiosity we were expecting from a movie touching the death of a beloved actor, the discovery of a new and misterious civilization. It all feels and looks flavorless, rushed and disjointed. Despite the massive space in narration that is given to exposition, we get never really acquainted with the reign of Talocan and its tradition, and the explanation on why the conflict arises never feels believable or justified. Where the movie is best at is at paying homage to the late Boseman, giving us some thoughtful reflections on the tragedy of the death of a dear one, and how we can grow in a difficult situation such as this one. Unfortunately, the rest of the movies shies away from this somber tone, and prefers to get back to the usual, predictable (tiresome?)

","""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" felt to me like a fresh restart of the Black Panther saga, perhaps explaining the somewhat tempered ratings by those expecting a direct continuation. Its introduction to the new phase was underscored by a captivating storyline, especially with the depiction of the people of Talokan. However, when it came to the undersea visuals, the comparison with James Cameron's ""Avatar"" is almost inevitable, where the latter arguably captured our hearts with its ethereal beauty. The representation of the city underwater might have felt a tad underwhelming, but I surmise this could be attributed to the narrative's stronger emphasis on Wakanda. My anticipation tells me that Talokan might soon get its own dedicated film or series, broadening the universe even further. A poignant observation for me was the portrayal of the leadership's response to Black Panther's death, which seemed to overshadow the communal emotions of Wakanda's citizens.

Besides from how sudden that happens the rest of the movie feels more natural. The aftermath is shown in a very interesting and serious way, something I was missing in this 4th phase, the story flows very natural, you can understand why suddenly Namor has appeared and his reasons for trying to stay hidden. Also, the comflict Shuri has is very good in the movie, the way they kinda manage to make her a not very good person at the beginning is great but it also comes out of nowhere considering how lighthearted she was on the first movie; it doesnt affect it to much but it still comes as odd. By far the best part is Namor, he is very threatening whenever he is on screen and Im really looking forward to see whats next for him, despite me personally hating the actor.

Sure, there is a giant cgi battle at the end (Marvel couldn't end it any other way), but the conflict is more nuanced than BP1. If the villain isn't as interesting or original as Killmonger, he is more sympathetic. His motivation is the survival of his people - not unlike Shuri. The movie is well-shot and has many creative sequences done practically (Shuri at one point seems to emerge from water completely dry; all they had to do was film her entering the water and reverse the footage). This isn't an ugly 3D-animated mess: there are people behind the camera and in front of the camera too. The cherry on top is that it pays tribute to Chadwick Boseman without objectifying his death.

682,26 February 2023,PartTimeCritic,3," Bloated and Unfocused Mess
","THE BLACK PANTHER: WAKANDA FOREVER (C-) is a bloated film hobbled and rendered relatively inert by trying to serve far too many ends. First and foremost, Ryan Coogler wants this to be a serious and high-minded superhero film: it plays with heavy themes of imperialism & vengeance, includes plenty of long sit down talks about those themes, and checks off almost every desire for a diverse cast. Second, the film tries to be a sequel to ""Black Panther"" despite the hole left by the deceased Chadwick Boseman. Lastly, the film tries to be part of the wider MCU, introducing new kingdoms and characters to the ongoing MCU story. The three never fully mesh and often act against each other. The high minded part of the film thankfully gives us some beautiful and imaginative art direction as well as a great musical score, but it unfortunately just feels like a rehash of the same questions the first one brought up. It bloats the film and cuts off any of the fun spectacle that the second two goals were trying to accomplish. On that second goal, the film is just not able to replace the charisma that Boseman brought. Shuri is a nice secondary character, but whether its due to the writing/direction/performance, she just isn't as compelling, decisive, or believable as a main. Lastly, having to conform to the formula of an MCU film often led to those serious sequences being undercut by a dumb and subpar, but mandatory as an MCU film, action sequence. I'd be a bit more forgiving of the attempt to be serious if there was much interesting in what the film was trying to says. In one example, we have a serious moment between the Queen and Shuri (who is a strong scientist) where Shuri doubts her mother's belief that the passed away T'Challa is in the wind like she is experiencing. I thought, maybe the film will be an interesting discussion of science vs. Faith that will have ramifications for the MCU...but Shuri eventually takes the same ""protector liquid"" that takes people to the ancestral plane and is just proved wrong. No thoughtful discussions here - the decision to keep the MCU intact wins out. Another example, but going the other way is a moment where Shuri has her new strength (from the protector liquid) and puts on the Black Panther suit and like a strong main character she is dropped right into the middle of the discussion of whether to go to war with Namor and his tribe. This conversation feels like it goes on and on and gets bogged down with the seriousness and moral ambiguity the director wants for the film. This should have been an easy decision in the MCU direction - you partner Shuri's first appearance with the black panther suit with a triumphant black and white ""I'm the new blank panther moment"" audience cheer, not with a drawn-out ambiguous war discussion. But that didn't happen because Coogler wants Shuri to be wrong here - driven by vengeance and the real problem is not with the misunderstandings between the two noble oppressed groups, but with the devious American imperializers. Think about this encapsulation of the film, we essentially get the female reboot of Iron Man in this film and it's this throw away storyline that the film really doesn't care about and is so generic that I literally could write, ""black female college student that is high tech smarter than others"" and you'd know pretty much everything about her the film wants to tell us. I wasn't a big fan of the first Black Panther film, but at least that one was more focused and anchored with by Bosewick's moral integrity.

","The whole movie felt like I was watching a documentary in the Marvel Universe. It's not bad, and it's not good too. They're just showing what's going on in the Marvel Universe after T'Challa's death. But it's only the first part of the movie, the beginning. They're showing what's Wakanda doing after their lost, and how are they communicating with other countries of world, which are wanting to get their own piece of vibranium. And after this first part of the movie, there appears Nemor. And I wanna say that he is really a great villain, one of my favorite Marvel villains now (okay, but his wings on his feet looks really weird). I liked the water army, with their warrior whales, water bombs and other. And I liked how Riri Williams appears in the plot, I thought she will be just a side character for fanservice and as a teaser of the Iron Heart series, but no. She was really an important character for the plot. Also I liked that the Marvel logo in the beginnig starts with Chadwick Boseman's scenes. And ends with it. Rest in piece legend...
So now I wanna talk about things I didn't liked in the movie. For the first - The world under the ocean. They showed it only visually, and it was beautiful. But they didn't show how works it, they didn't show how live there the people of there, what are they doing, where are they studying or work. I don't know, it was really good movie, but it was kinda... boring? I don't know, there were a lot of great action scenes, but sometimes i really wanted to sleep. Well, i recomend this movie, especially if you aren't marvel fans, but you want cotinue follow this universe. This had his own interesting plot, but there weren't an intrigue, had his interesting new places and locations, fantastic visual, and few nice fanservice scenes. This was good movie, but without Chadwick and Michael B Jordan (there was his mini cameo but it was too short) as main characters it wasn't so good, so I think 2 hours and 40 minutes too much for this.

","In recent days, the vision of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever could not be missed. Film that closes Phase 4 of Marvel and is also the first without Chadwick Boseman. Overall it is one of the best films of its stage. We had been promised by the director, producers and cast a solemn film in memory of the real Black Panther ... and so it was. The real protagonist of this film? Wakanda. The villain of this movie? There is not. Yes, because Namor is not that. Let's start right from the new entry. Basically I didn't mind at all how this character was reinvented due to the many similarities with Aquaman. The interpretation, on the other hand, is nothing in particular that can be remembered. The soundtrack department chosen for the city of Namor, on the other hand, I adored to madness. But let's come to the surface, more precisely to Wakanda. All the traditions staged are very beautiful .... but Shuri's narrative development is so hateful and flat that I ""rooted"" against her (but for Namor). The most successful character on dry land and who steals the show from everyone is undoubtedly Mbaku (yes hell!!). The new...ah no new Iron Man (Riri Wiliam/Iron Heart) has just been introduced, so let's skip it.",/review/rw9054025/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_Wakanda_Forever_2022

","There was a lot of great things about the film: the costumes were great and everything about Wakanda Forever was visually stunning. Easily the most realistic under water scenes I've ever seen in a movie to date. The fight scenes were awesome, but as soon as it was time for them to act or have dialogue it was super cringe. The namor scenes were great but anything that didn't have Namor in it could have put me right to sleep. I mean it's not just that it's probably the most ""woke"" movie ever made to date. The actors are just really really bad. I really hope they don't try to make a spin off movie with the girl who's somehow the greatest scientist on the planet now replacing Tony Stark as Iron(Wo)man, but you know they're gonna try!

This show fell into that trap with humming bird wings that can propel a man supersonic to the stratosphere.

","Was always going to be challenging to deliver a second movie without Chadwick Boseman. However they did a fantastic job at honoring him and continuing to develop the story. The Queen was incredible and really carried the story along. Her poise and strength was fantastic , as were many of the performances. It balanced loss with humour , which is no easy thing to do. Aside from the great acting , the fight scenes and cinematography were excellent. There were even a few scenes which almost had me in tears of both joy and sadness. I am really glad they brought many of the characters back and developed them a bit more. If you liked the first , I would highly recommend this one also.

The timing on this movie is expected with such a large storyline. The main plot never lost its fire, while still playing into Easter eggs of the future Marvel films and shows to come. This was a huge task for Marvel and I think they did a fantastic job with all aspects. It was a beautiful story about family, tradition and legacy.

Tenoch Huerta played Namor as the antagonist in Wakanda Forever pretty good as he imposed a threat to Wakanda and the people of it.

Angela Bassett was a stand out in all her scenes - no surprise there - but her fellow actors were kind of left in the dust. Unfortunately, the film makers tried to prop up the film with some CGI, but it fell flat. My opinion - best part of the film was the beginning memorial to Chadwick Boseman.

The new Black Panther should have been M'Baku, not Shuri as she didn't want to become the savior of their people till the last of the 3rd act, and it was truly horrific to watch, no fault could be made as she was already perfect in combat, a training montage or something, no character development nothing earned.

","I watched this movie with no great expectations. I think for most people, the attraction of the MCU has faded. It's not surprising after the over saturation of the content over the past few years. I think last year there were six tv shows and four movies. And honestly, I've never been a huge fan of the characters. But I have to admit that there are two things that Marvel does well...emotionally resonant scenes and big action. Wakanda Forever had both. It was far too long, and I think this was affected by the premature death of Chadwick Boseman. It was hard to balance an emotional story of farewell to that character with an absurd one of fish-people being angry with Wakanda. This leads me to my biggest problem with the portrayal of Wakanda, and the fish people in the MCU. Vibranium is supposed to give both countries this amazing technological advantage over the rest of the world to the extent that major powers like the US are afraid of Wakanda, and yet when they actually do fight-their warriors line up in ranks like it's 1435. Where are the tanks? The heavy guns? The missiles? They do have jet like things. It just seems like strategically, if the Wakandans every did go to war with a country like the US, it would be a massacre. And the fish people are even worse. They have no advanced technology whatsoever. And yet they are able to catch Wakanda by surprise.

",Director Ryan Coogler takes on an impossible task. That task would be how to make a sequel without your main star. With the unfortunate passing of Chadwick Bosermen the early stages of the movie was in shambles. But Ryan Coogler came out with a fantastic story. Wakanda Forever did something that a few films made me do that is to make you feel like death is really hitting you. The emotion that people went through watching this was unbelievable. How can you add so much emotions in one film? The story wise was great. When you have to deal with a passing of your one lead. It's groundbreaking. The film main villain Namor (Tenoch Huerta) was a really refreshing take. The past few MCU flims was lacking a really good villain but in this one it was redeemed back again. Now there is a majority of elements of story that I agree with but with its runtime of 2hr 41min. There was something's that could've been left out. Angela Bassett (Ramonda) was spectacular. She took what she could make and made it ten times more better. One of the best acting performances I seen in the MCU. Dominique Thorne (Iron heart) was very much enjoyable. When you have a film that deals with so much grief. You need a character to break the ice with and she did exactly that. Can't wait to see her in Disney+ iron heart. The one and only new Black Panther Letitia Wright Aka (Shuri). Gave a incredible performance. I could only imagine the news that shoud got explaining that she would have to be the new Black Panther and a short amount of Time. She was great she took what she can and what she experienced with Chadwick Bosermen Black Panther and made it her own. Well done. So at the end everyone who worked on this film did an amazing job. Thanks you Kevin Feige and Ryan Coogler for the great film it was a great way to end Phase 4 of the MCU.

The story was building up untill the second half of the movie, where i just was a bit curious of how they would connect the dots. Again, it was an enjoyable movie.

The acting was good, I loved the instrumental music, visually better and more enjoyable. I still would've recast it, but for what they chose to do it was done well. Namor was done well and I like the spotlight it gave on Ramonda. I think Ironheart was just thrown into the plot for the sake of the show that's coming up about her, for the sake of not having a 3-hour movie that whole part would be the part I'd cut.

","The first black panther movie was ok for me, except for the Wakanda itself. I like the comic book character and think that he was a great addition to the marvel movies. This movie should have continued with the black panther despite the death of the lead character. His family even requested it and the studio should have agreed, because this movie was not any good. Story pelt weak and long and drawn out. The princess is a good character but not the lead, which is why they needed a black panther character. Not to say it needed to be a male role but just someone with a commanding presence. As for Wakanda itself, I have always had a problem why it had to be in Africa and not on some remote island, like Wonder Woman. To have a society that is superiors with technology, wealth, medical, and weapons be in a continent that has such a bad history of poverty and genocide just seems far from reality and selfish. It's not as if they discovered the metal, it was from an asteroid.

","Can't imagine where to start. The first thing to say is that Tchalla's tribute was so perfect, and the entire audience went silent. As a sequel, this is an awesome story, the way its characters have been balanced is so cool. The character building of Shuri felt Wow like the way Peter Parker's character in Spider-man No Way Home. It was completely brought up to Chadwick's level. I absolutely love the way the character's build-up was shown in those few hours. Ironheart doesn't have a big character build-up, maybe they put it in the upcoming Ironheart series because I saw footage of Riri Williams in the first Ironhard costume. After that, if you take Namor's character, he is the best villain in this phase 4. Namor's back story has changed when looking at the comic, But they have worked hard to show Namor in the same way in the comic. It can be said that one of the best villains built up in the MCU, more epic than Gorr the God Butcher seen in Thor: Love and Thunder. Almost everyone had good screen time and Ryan Coogler balaced everything. Feminism, LGBTQ, and jokes were balanced throughout the film. More emotional than action. Also, there was a good plot for the story, again the MCU seems to be on the right track. Namor is a badass guy. The people who play Namor and Shuri are obsessed with those characters. The next thing to remember is Music. It's crazy. BGM is so dope in many places. The best music and visuals are seen in phase 4. The visuals of Talokan are so great. Although there were minor glitches in the CG VFX, there were no major glitches in the overall film. Also, to make the plot stronger, they could have increased the running time of the story with vibranium. Based on vibranium and contains something like a good fight.

Speaking of Talokan, this movie perfectly sets up the nation of Talokan and I can't wait to see more of it in the future.

He is really dangerous and powerful and you see it in his first attack on Wakanda. Now I want to talk about wakanda itself. There is a reason why this movie is called Wakanda Forever. This movie isn't about Black Panther it is about the mourning of the sudden death of him and how Wakanda copes with the loss. And you really feel it everyone is at the top of their game, Angela Bassett gives an amazing Oscar worthy performance and Letitia Wright is the core of emotions.

However, he falls considerably short of the memorable Killmonger from the first film of the franchise. The cast did a commendable job especially Leticia Wright, Danai Gurira and Angela Bassett. Those who were merely supporting characters in BP were here elevated to main roles and they rose to the occasion. The background score was superb just like BP.

And during the production everything that could have been used to turn this into gold was thrown out the window. The lead hero was miscast and doesn't get to show off the suit until the last 20 minutes of the film. At that point it seems kind of rushed; rushed even for an origin story. Chop the first hour of the film; and make the last 20 minutes be the beginning, splice some fluff in the middle and take the final 10 minutes of that ending b reel and stretch it out. Develop the villain a bit more. Flush him out. We have reached a point where marvel has to cast a female villain or a female heroin. And when they do that they have a tendency to remove ""men"" all together from the film. You know it's going to be boring when that happens? Right.

WHILE all of our warriors are still battling theirs? They'd all look at the two leaders coming back on some floating saucer and be like wtf did we just fight to the death for just to go have brunch afterwards and talk about the weather forecast. In the OG Black Panther, if you challenged the entirety of Wakanda and all its people, you met your fate of death or incarceration; this time we just gave them a hug & kiss and said don't do it again?

Of course they failed, the movie tries to be serious but sometimes it doesn't seem that way. The fact that the film is for the age of 12+ does not help in my opinion, if the film was for the age of 12+ it would have reached a different league.

There is an actual point in the film where characters argue about not having time to do something that could have stopped the entire final act of the film, but they spend more time arguing about NOT having time than just simply DOING the thing and moving on. It was utterly pointless and stupid. There's so much fluff in the film too.

","If it feels as though this has a gaping hole where its heart should be, that's because it does. The tragic real life death of Chadwick Boseman looms over every second of 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022)', leaving an indelible mark on a story which was originally supposed to centre entirely around his iconic character. Director Ryan Coogler and co have, in the face of an almost impossible task, crafted an experience that's very much designed around his absence, one which directly tackles his death by inextricably tying it into its narrative. The filmmakers obviously had a massive challenge on their hands. They needed to not only craft a compelling experience that's both entertaining and emotionally resonant, but also respectfully provide a suitable replacement for Boseman who can take up the Black Panther mantle in future sequels. They had to do this this in a fairly tight timeframe, while also radically altering their initial plans and grappling with their own unexpected loss of a colleague and friend as they continued work on a film that he should have been a part of. Plus, they had to transpose their own pain onto the characters, be it from a writing or performance point of view, which can't have been an easy thing to do. This, of course, is an unenviable task, so I can't blame them too much for the perhaps unsurprising fact that they don't really succeed in doing what they set out to. The end result of their admirable effort is, sadly, underwhelming.",/review/rw9054025/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_Wakanda_Forever_2022

It meant the battle scenes were just dull rather than epic, and sometimes I thought it was watching an advert for a perfume or iPhone. Even when you thought a twist had been introduced they didn't follow-up or something implausible turns it round.

","After avoiding the first BP due to the bad reviews I read, I was excited to see this one in person, and I am glad I did. Yea, I understand the frustration from marvel/Disney lately, but some viewers rush to make critical opinions. Sure this movie had more females in the cast but was it objectively targeted at girls? NO. I don't understand the dislike towards Riri. Did her character feel a little forced into the script? Yea. Did the final iron suit look strange-also, yea. But the actress who played Riri gave a strong performance and blended well into the cast. I feel like many guys are bitter because the character is female. The movie had strong performances from male actors like Jordan and Winston. Overall I enjoyed the film as it provides a deep sense of how Shuri dealt with grief. Maybe it could have been shorter, and some moments might have been predictable, but this movie held my attention all the way through. Talokan is an intriguing new destination in the MCU, and Namor plays a great villain even if some people do not consider him one. Suppose I could change anything about the ending; I wanted Shuri to force Namor into revealing the underwater vibranium. I have higher hope now for the iron heart series.

If you are someone who expects an out and out super hero movie with hard core action sequences with Damal Dumeel scenes out of nowhere then this movie is not for you!!! I loved every bit of what I watched on the screen.. It was about embracing pain when you have lost someone close to you, Not giving up with what's lost rather rebuilding a Kingdom with everything that's left with them. In today's world most of us are consumed by Vengeance. It's easy to harm someone who has caused us pain. You could be the strongest person in this world and you will have every valid person to Harm or even Kill the person standing in front of you for what he has done to you.. However, in spite of whatever he has done to you, if you have a heart to forgive him and give him another chance to realise his mistake.. that's where and when you become a better person and make this world a beautiful place for You and Others to live. It takes seconds to destroy something but it takes generations to build something. And these values shown by the characters is what made me fall in love with the movie.

","(First IMDB Movie Review) Black Panther: Wakanda Forever - Probably the most emotional Marvel movie to date and it did it so well. I cried five times in this movie and I haven't cried that much in a while. The themes in this movie of grief, revenge, legacy, and family were astounding and handled very well. Letitia Wright was phenomenal in this movie and brought so much emotion and force to the character of Shuri. The Dora Milaje were badass and exceptional at fighting as usual. Dominique Thorne did a fabulous job introducing us to the new energetic character that is Riri Williams. However, the main standout acting came Angela Bassett as the passionate, powerful, and moving Queen Ramonda; she stole almost every scene she was in with an electric presence. The main strength of this movie for me was the way they handled Chadwick Boseman's passing and the amazing amount of respect they gave him and his character of T'Challa. Now, getting into the more technical stuff the cinematography was incredible along with the costume design and soundtrack. The CGI was really well done and only had a few slight moments where I noticed problems. All in all, this was a great film and is now my favorite film of Phase 4 well making my top 10 in the MCU as a whole. I definitely recommend seeing this in theatres if you can, I know that I'm going to be making more trips back to see it a few more times. All I have to say now is - Rest in Peace Chadwick... your legacy will always be with us.",/review/rw9054025/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_Wakanda_Forever_2022

","I'd like to say that this movie lived up to, or even came relatively close to its predecessor, however that would be far from the truth. The story, characters, and care taken with the first movie was absolutely thrown out the window for the second. Apart from one performance, all characters felt flat and cardboard like - with clunky dialogue and unnecessary storylines crowing an already long film. I wanted to connect and really feel for our main protagonists, however the sheer amount of jumping around, and a lack of story beats truly made it hard for the emotional moments to really hit home. Where the previous film was praised for the way it presented the different tribes and celebrated culture, this film (aside from the opening sequences) pushed it far far to the side, and felt very superficial in its treatment of that previous sentiment (for both known and new peoples). The fight scenes were busy and not impactful, with far too much jumping around, characters mysteriously gained and lost strength depending on who they were fighting, and it seemed like the most dangerous thing in the movie was a water grenade in varying numbers. I would like to say the sound design was good (the last films was excellent) but there was so much abrupt licensed music that killed the mood, that I would struggle even saying that.",/review/rw9054025/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_Wakanda_Forever_2022

","Very disappointing movie. Acting was mediocre at best, story was extremely predictable and uninspired, and last but not least most characters lacked proper character development, motivations and backstories. Beyond the overall low quality of the movie, it goes on to stain and degrade the legacy of other popular and established heroes such as Ironman and Black Panther. As an example, in my humble opinion you cannot replace a popular super hero like Ironman with a character that was just introduced moments earlier. The original Ironman from the Marvel cinematic universe had many challenges, character arcs and a backstory that spanned over 3 standalone movies not including the Avenger movies. The story told in said movies helped facilitate a connection with the character and a deep understanding for the characters thoughts/motivations that led to each decision made. To simplify, we understood the character and why they did what they did. Good storytelling and character development creates a unique understanding where you could imagine how a character would react with in any situation. Oppositely, the same cannot be said about 90 percent of the characters in Wakanda Forever. This is especially true for the new super hero chosen to take the mantle of Ironman in this movie. That being said, most of the characters suffered from this same issue. Even the new Black Panther character suffered from this lack of story although it is important to note an attempt was at least made when it came to her portrayal of Black Panther. The movie felt like a cash grab opposed to an interesting and well thought out story that should have and/or could have been entertaining. It seemed like a jumbled over utilization of video effects lacking crucial movie elements. Very disappointing. Lastly, I would be curious to see the unedited version of Wakanda Forever looks like....

It handles this tragedy tastefully, showing grief in a more mature way than what you'd expect from Marvel, and it feels more impactful and realistic than the collective grief we've been shown so far for Tony Stark. Visuals and CGI are MUCH better than the first one, and the way the plot and characters intertwine really hits home thanks to fantastic performances from the whole cast, especially Angela Basset. Namor is a great villain-not the best we've seen in this universe, but certainly superior to recent ones.

Also white people are evil , music was terrible, zero originality in every way especially considering the lifted iron man 1 scenes with worse cgi -somehow- and the general look felt like a fancy bourlesque show with all African American cast (and a very bad martin freeman).

","The film moves far too slowly with fruitless exposition on loss and the evils of colonialism. It's bloated runtime makes it a painful watch that barely holds your attention. The lack of a strong central personality to provide cohesion and direction rather than what feels like a revolving door of ancillary characters in mourning slowing the plot to a crawl. New addition Riri Williams as Ironheart was a big miss for the film. When introduced she is arrogant and unlikeable, but quickly she becomes a flat and boring macguffin. Her final costume design is also laughably bad when compared to how great all the other costume and design choices were in the film. Perhaps, in my opinion, the biggest missed opportunity is Namor and his people. Making them a derivative of a native Mexican culture rather than being true to the source material or creating a new and novel civilization comes across as a forced agenda driven decision rather than a true artistic endeavor. The choice was clearly made to have exposition on the evils of colonialism. This exposition is lost on or moot for much of the target audience. Agenda as a plot device has become tiresome and exceedingly shallow at this point particularly when it detracts from the quality of the end product as I feel it did here. I firmly believe that faithfulness to the comic Namor or had they broke new ground would have served the film tremendously. Aside from that personal quibble I did like Tenoch Huerta in the role. He very much grabbed my attention when he was oncscreen, but not as much as M'baku(Winston Duke) who is a scene stealer. It really hurt the film that he has so much more screen presence than Shuri(Letitia Wright) or the Queen Romonda(Angela Bassett). Queen Romonda does have a few strong moments on her own to be fair. Now the problem of the final act. It is beyond lackluster. It has no honest drama to pull you in. It just does not do a good job making you believe that there is much riding on this final confrontation. I also lacks a lot of the fun eye candy in which Marvel films tend to excel. Finally, the worst issue for this film is nothing with it per se, but more the presence of who is not there. The loss of Chadwick Boseman was awful, and I truly wish he could have reprised his role as T'Challa. His memory haunts this film terribly. There are many moments of reflection and questioning how to go forward without him causing characters throughout to be directionless and unmotivated. Loss is a major point of the film's message, but unfortunately it puts a nearly insurmountable hurdle in the way of the story.

And now talking about the direction I find such a mediocre corner, fight scenes that are not cool or fun, some epic moments and the action scenes have many unnecessary cuts. And now talking about the story, it's interesting, about how wakanda is a superpower, but a defect is that if wakanda is a superpower then why didn't it just go and kill namor and his army at once, and why talking about namor, the villain of this movie is not that interesting story nice but not gripping, and there is a part of the movie that namor could have destroyed and killed everyone there, and I wonder why he didn't! And then he comes with a story that he's going to take some time to bring his army to destroy wakanda, no, that's serious!!

Simultaneously trying to balance the increasingly ridiculous-in-scope Marvel universe, its own fabricated reality where Wakanda controls the world, and an entirely new undersea atmospheric immersion proved far too much to handle. For the entire viewing experience, you could palpably feel the movie's Chadwick Boseman-sized hole. For a movie with a budget dwarfing many African countries' annual military expenditures, the movie's sum was less than any one of its components. The slow build, with no real plot or incremental character development from its prequel, drags on for ~1.5 hours. Eventually, there is an engaging fight scene in Wakanda, only for the full-scale cinematic war to pivot a one-on-one fight between a literal god and a young, untrained girl. Shuri's only training was a therapy session with her deceased, aggressive uncle in a dream, yet this was sufficient to defeat the leader of a mythical race who harnessed the power of the sun underwater. Had the movie focused on any single component and fully fleshed it out - e.g. Shuri learning to navigate the real-world after the death of her brother, a large-scale battle for planet earth between Marvel heroes and the underwater, immortal creatures, or even a more coherent succession battle within Wakanda for the position of Black Panther, it would have been better than result: a shoddy grasp to eke out profits from a franchise that should have rested in peace with Chadwick Boseman.",/review/rw9054025/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_Wakanda_Forever_2022

","It looks like the Marvel are evolving, but just backwards as their movies have lost their touch. It was just made to honor Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther. This sequel of Black Panther was very boring and it seemed to go on and on. It didn't hook me at all. The plot was very weak with awful direction. The story was slow with little or no character development. Very flat movie for me and if you have nothing else to watch, you can watch it but I dont feel like watching this movie with my friends or family or any occasion. The ending is very flat and boring too. Never once it had my interest. I wish they end Black Panther and do not drag it further.",/review/rw9054025/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Panther_Wakanda_Forever_2022

","We get it, we all missed the lead black panther, but there's no need to sacrifice the script and specially the motivations to act according to each character. Two or three characters act according to their personality, everybody else acts according to where the story wants to go, so, credibility is thrown out the window. Hence, the movie is frustrating, slow and at certain times annoying. When the sarcophagus is rising, the quality and attention to detail was worst than an intern paying to do an internship for carrying a bag of potatoes. The base of Kukulkans story was an extraordinary idea, but poorly developed, it seems as if the writers didn't sat down to think ""would this character do this, or that"" instead they just wrote it without care, thus, several characters lost their credibility around 3/4 of the movie.

In this quest, Shuri's ascent as a young princess and warrior served as the key to the crown. The epic story of Wakanda Forever unfolds before our eyes as Shuri's character grows, revealing her highs and lows along the way.

1493,17 February 2023,ryanperez-22064,3," Didn't Honor The First Movie's Legacy
","I know that Ryan Coogler had to rewrite the script because of Chadwick Boseman's passing but I felt he wasn't given enough time to flesh out the story. The funeral scene was touching and Namor was a great villain though I felt this sequel did disservice to what was established. In the first movie, T'Challa promises the world to share their resources and Vibranium. In the sequel. It's like ""Sorry. We're taking back our Vibranium and keeping Wakanda hidden again"". Also, the movie didn't show how Queen Ramonda and Shuri ran Wakanda after T'Challa's passing. Instead, we get a typical comic book revenge story that doesn't go with what's established from the first movie. Ramonda's death had me almost walk out of the theater since she was just introduced. Using that to make Shuri to become Black Panther was not cool. She should have been inspired and motivated by either T'Challa or her father in the Ancestral Plane. Like what was Shuri's relationship with her father like? Even though he covered the story about his brother and Killmonger, he could have been redeemed to tell Shuri to not make the same mistake he did. Instead, we get Killmonger which I know that was out of fanservice to motivate Shuri to take down Namor. I mean didn't T'Challa tell Shuri that you should never vengeance consume you? In conclusion, there were good and bad choices in the movie. Also, no one applauded when I saw the movie three times. Not even when Shuri wore her Black Panther suit. Guess everyone feels the same way. When I first saw the first movie, I walked out overjoyed seeing a landmark film. With the sequel, I walked out saying ""Did we just lose?"" If this movie was to give us closure after Chadwick Boseman's passing, it midly succeeded. Not like how Endgame gave us closure after we lost our main heroes. I didn't feel healed after watching the movie. Shuri was barely healed and she should have closure after seeing her father or T'Challa in the Ancestral Plane. Then she would have been healed including the audience. I didn't feel lifted by Rhianna's song at the end. It felt like a funeral song. I felt Ryan Coogler messed up his characters and needed to rewrite the script more. He's one of my favorite storytellers but needed some help. Killing off the queen was wrong. You could have put her in a coma. Now, Shuri lost her whole family making the whole film depressing. Like in a way, Namor won. He wanted everything to fall even though he wants Wakanda to be his ally. So, yeah. This film is divisive. It's how I felt about Multiverse of Madness. I know most people didn't like Love and Thunder but at least the movie was fun, straight forward and got you pumped to see more. I walked out of that movie with a smile on my face. Definitely the MCU's finest movies in a while. With Wakanda Forever, I felt flabbergasted and not overjoyed.

","It was a disaster. After the death of the Black Panther King, the sense of solemnity and Marvel style shenanigans under internal troubles and foreign conflicts intermittently appeared, which dealt a devastating blow to the characters on the basis of the already shallow group image creation. The spectacle presentation of the new country and the Marvel Universe interaction task imposed by studio even squeezed out the role of the first protagonist Suri. When the drama is out of control, there is only one action scene, but it is also full of almost zero action design, shot editing that seems to avoid action description and strong CG sense. The most ridiculous thing is that the feminist point of view is carried out from the beginning to the end, and Shuri's growth is so valuable (btw's acting is very poor), from others to her full protection to her full protection, the last minute egg disgusting face finally can not be maintained, and there is still a little prince, or a man who wants to win the fruits of the revolution. Sure enough, the throne can only be sat by men, who win the final moment but foil. Namo is very big down there.
