0,7 November 2021,cricketbat,6," Why wasn't she given a movie back in 2011 or 2012?
","After all these years, Black Widow finally gets her own standalone movie and... it's okay. I actually found Florence Pugh, David Harbour, and Rachel Weisz to be entertaining additions, but the story felt cobbled together and it was riddled with plot holes. I know Natasha is a very skilled assassin, for instance, but she's almost invulnerable in this. It probably would have been better to give Black Widow her solo film a year or two after Iron Man 2 came out.",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

2,21 August 2021,AlsExGal,7," Natasha Romanoff, aka ""The Black Widow"", finally gets to tell her story
","I was expecting a typical, CGI-infused Avenger movie, and it certainly is that. Black Widow, though, has a lot in common with James Bond movies. There's even a scene in which 007 is playing on TV. The Black Widow must stop a Russian General called Dreykov, a sort of SPECTRE czar megalomaniac who ""rescues"" unwanted girls and turns them into super assassins, called widows. Widows go through extensive training. A select few get chosen. The rest are killed. This makes Dreykov a monstrous misogynist, in a movie, directed by a woman, Cate Shortland, which has unmistakable feminist themes. There are two main Black Widows: Scarlett Johansson's character, and Yelena Belova, played by Florence Pugh. Belova is impulsive where Romanoff is introspective. The two are sisters only in that they grew up as part of a Russian cell, in an Ohio suburb, along with Rachel Weisz as their brilliant scientist mother, and David Harbour, as Red Guardian, Russia's version of Captain America, as the dad.",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

4,31 July 2022,toseale,7," They Should've Had More of These From the Beginning
","After many years and many movies, Black Widow, one of the original Avengers, finally got a movie. And while it wasn't anything groundbreaking, it was still a fun watch. Taking into consideration the splash of spy genre, a pack of new and interesting characters, plenty of action and intensity, I'd say this wasn't a bad movie. It's something exciting, while not totally memorable in the large expanse of the MCU. Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh both did great. David Harbor's character was good and definitely became a favorite in the movie, but I think he still has some things to unravel. The ending ""big reveal"" was kind of mediocre, but the final fight swept it under the rug mostly. Hopefully we'll get more of some of these characters in the future so they'll have the time they need to grow. Overall, if you haven't watched it and want a movie to watch while you're bored, I'd recommend this one.",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

","There've been complaints about the 'lateness' of this film, how it should've been made years ago and now that we've finally gotten it, it's 'too late'. I beg to differ, as I feel all good things come to those who wait (and those too impatient for something don't deserve it to begin with). However one may feel about Scarlett Johansson as an actress, there's no denying she's been in the MCU longer than most (if there's one 'good' thing about IM2, it's that it introduced this awesome character). She's done the hard yards and the fact that it's taken until now to get her well-deserved solo film isn't her fault (blame the higher-ups). While some dismissed her as 'not special' because she didn't possess super powers, she's proven her detractors wrong by enduring for so long.",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

19,9 July 2021,tymoody,8," Pleasantly Surprised
","I don't quite understand the hate the movie is getting. Too many people expected full comic book accuracy with Taskmaster, which would have been hard to accomplish and harder to fit in the story they were trying to tell. I understand the disappointment from fans who expected that full Taskmaster story, but do not think it means that this movie was a flop. Florence Pugh was excellent in the film and the chemistry between her and Scarlett Johansson was great. Good fighting sequences except for parts of the third act where the CGI was very noticeable. Plus that end credit scene was amazing. One of my only complaints is that Marvel stated you wouldn't need to watch the shows to understand the movies but if you hadn't seen falcon and the winter solider the end credits may not make a 100 percent sense. At least make it clear the shows are a must watch if you are going to make them necessary to understand certain things. Overall a great movie.",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

Finally we get some back story to Natasha, the story was obviously the core and mostly it was a throughly entertainment and in depth story about her family and past. Action as usual was great, and the use of sound in the Dolby atmos theatre was superb. Comedic moments were great in the film, audience had great reactions. The music was great as well. One particular choice of song stood out for me. (Watch and you'll find out I hope) I liked how you are able to connect to the characters more since it's a more grounded film.

With the antidote in hand and chased by Task Master, the two setoff to gather information from former spies and adoptive parents Axeis Shostakov (David Harbour) and Melina Vostokoff (Rachel Weisz) and set out to bring down the Red Room and free the Widows under Dreykov's control.",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021
51,14 November 2021,GusherPop,10," Scarlett Johansson first marvel actress to produce and direct her own film.
","There's an added poignancy to the year-plus delay of Marvel's ""Black Widow,"" finally ending July 9th when the film will be in theaters and available for a premium charge on Disney+. And there's a palpable sense that this story would have felt a little delayed even in May 2020. After all, why did Thor, Captain America, and Iron Man get three standalone films before Natasha Romanoff got one? Fans complained long before the pandemic that it felt like Black Widow was getting pushed aside, only given her own adventure after the end of her story in ""Avengers: Endgame."" Director Cate Shortland's movie confirms that Black Widow could have carried her own flick ages ago. They seemed like a normal family, but 'mom' and 'dad' were really Russian spies, and the girls were only being prepped for their coming induction in a super soldier program back in the homeland. After an explosive opening, the credits for ""Black Widow"" reveal that Natasha and Yelena were turned from average girls to killing machines, separated when Romanoff murdered the head of the program, Dreykov (Ray Winstone), and destroyed his Red Room. Or did she??. Jump ahead to just after ""Captain America: Civil War,"" when Natasha is on the run from her own government, underground after violating the Sokovia Accords. While she's off the grid, she receives a package from Yelena, who is suffering through her own forced exile after discovering a substance that releases the Widows from their chemical subjugation. As with a lot of the MCU, the third act here gets a little cluttered and repetitive but then the film recovers with a remarkable final action sequence that sends characters and debris hurtling through the sky (an MCU staple but Shortland's choreography makes it feel urgent again). It's ultimately a film that works on its own terms, a long-delayed enriching of the story of a beloved character that will make her ultimate sacrifice in ""Avengers: Endgame"" feel even more powerful in hindsight. Every blockbuster this Summer is being touted as the sign that the world is back to normal-""Black Widow"" is more a reminder of what fans loved before it shifted off its axis.",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

","As a Marvel fan I was highly sceptical about it. I don't like ""all power girls"" cast and the idea of prequels in general. But I watched it just because there was nothing new to watch. (I've watched Deep Space 9, Voyager, SG-1, Atlantis and etc already)
So, I started to watch without any enthusiasm, and what do I see? BADAM! Fake family undercover. Very realistic. This is how our cursed (Putins KGB/FSB) goverment do things in real life.

","Black Widow is undoubtedly one of the best installments of the MCU since instead of being a superhero movie, it is an action film that feels apart from the genre that Marvel is dedicated to. Scarlett Johansson is the best (this being her last Marvel movie) and the movie is pretty flawless and fresh. It details Natasha's origin and presents us with a spectacular story of her facing her past in a reunion with her sister and her guardians. Its only flaw is that it was made after Endgame since it should have been done years before, but it's an acceptable movie.

","Taking place after the events of Captain America: Civil War and before the events of Avengers: Infinity War, Scarlett Johansson returns once again as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow who is now on the run for helping Captain America and Bucky Barnes escape the U. S. government. When a mysterious new foe known as Taskmaster appears out of the shadows, Natasha must face her past and round up new characters from her past to take care of the unfinished business she thought she put behind her. So first off, Scarlett Johansson's Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow definitely gives this her best portrayal of her character that she has ever given. Although as much as it is her film, the standout character of the entire film is hands down Florence Pugh's Yelena Belova. She is astonishing while also stunning in the role and the film wouldn't be what it is without her character. David Harbour's Red Guardian is also a highlight of the film. Rachel Weisz's Melina is also a fine addition to the film, although I wish we would of gotten more screen time with her character. Ray Winstone's Dreykov was alright, but definitely didn't feel like he was a established enough villain for audiences to actually care about who his villain is as he doesn't have as much screen time. Taskmaster was also a huge let down by the end and I was not huge fan of the character choices they chose for the character. Besides that, some of the fight scenes were absolutely great in this film as well as the cinematography.

The beginning promises a generic and intense action movie which fails as soon as the protagonists display completely invincible durability, negating any tension. The second act is by far the best part of the film and brings together the family members back together. Great scenes like the prison escape sequence, Yelena's distraught longings for a family and the ramblings of Red Guardian really deepen the emotional core and relationships of the characters. The third act is mind-numbingly absurd as it escapes its grounded spy movie feel and transcends into traditional Marvel territory. Any pretense of hard-hitting action and emotion give way to overly obvious green-screening, unnecessary monologues, inexplicable sky fortresses, freefall fights and legions of girl drones controlling current events around the world.

","As a stand alone superhero movie that doesn't draw too much on the extended Marvel universe the Black Widow does very well. There is a decent story from beginning to end. Which serves the purpose of explaining the origin of the Black windows. It also introduces the red guardian to the mix and although he's prominent in the film he's not so essential to plot. As many other superheros would have been in prior movies. However I felt his portrayal by David Habour was a fun take on the character.. If one wants to look at the bigger picturer. I feel that marvel is eventually going to jump the proverbial shark with regards to its superhero movies. The stories are going to get too convoluted, plot wholes are going to eventually appear. Simply installing more and more dangerous villans is going to get repetitive. Eventually will there be a villan that can eat entire galaxies? Stand alone narratives with a beginning middle and end usually appeals to me more and since this is a branch off the main Marvel movie trunk. I could enjoy it better than the Avengers movies.

","Scarlett Johansson reprises her role as Marvel's Black Widow, a super-assassin named Natasha Romanov, whose ""mother"" is a super-scientist (played to a tee by Rachel Weisz), and ""father"" a superhero with a Russian identity, Red Guardian (played tongue-in-cheek by Stranger Things' David Harbour). Natasha's origin backstory is very reminiscent of the TV series The Americans, in that her ""parents"" and younger ""sister"" were never a ""real"" family, but the parts of a Russian cell in Ohio. And speaking of the character of Natasha's sis, Yelena, it is wonderfully portrayed by Florence Pugh, who is positively a revelation here. These two team up, joining their other ""family members"" to take on the master of all the widows, a true super-villain played by the unsympathetically smarmy Ray Winstone. A lot of themes are thrown into the mix, including the definition of ""family,"" nature vs. Nurture and the baggage we bring to all sorts of relationships.

117,13 October 2021,classicsoncall,8," ""You should have brought the Avengers' super-jet!""
","Another par for the course entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That's not to be read as good or bad, it simply is. The film traces the background story of Natasha Romanoff, the Avengers' Black Widow, portrayed by Scarlett Johansson. Everyone in her childhood family has a different last name which all gets sorted out by the end of the picture, but if you're not familiar with the character, it might get confusing for a while. You won't see as much real estate destroyed in this story, which sets it apart from some other Marvel flicks. In fact most of the damage is confined to villain Dreykov's (Ray Winstone) Red Room, which is a bit of a misnomer once you get to see what that's all about. There is a 'world at stake' component to the movie, but that's mostly confined to the mind control aspect of all the 'widows' Dreykov has positioned in far flung corners of the globe. That facet of the story doesn't even get to play out, as most of the action involves Natasha and her 'sister' Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) joining forces to take down Dreykov, and restore free will to all the Widows under his spell. There's a fair amount of humor in the story, mostly understated, and most of it involving Alexei Shostakov (David Harbour), father of our sister heroes. There's a running gag in the story, that quite frankly, I wondered how long it would take for one of the comic book movie franchises to deal with, and that's the whole idea of super-hero posing. You know what I'm talking about, the good guy (or gal) in question heroically drops from the sky with one knee to the ground, opposite fist planted squarely to the Earth, and holding the pose momentarily for the audience to marvel at (oops, no pun intended there). Pugh's character got that ball rolling and the script writers milked it for a couple more humorous scenes. You have to admit, it does look a bit pretentious, but at the same time, pretty cool as well. The after credits scene isn't really a big surprise, since we knew of Black Widow's ultimate fate with the finale of ""Avengers: End Game"". But if you didn't know or forgot, it might come as a bit of a shocker, as it points to a sequel of sorts with the ""Hawkeye"" mini-series due out later this year. And lest the movie itself reminds you of the kind of action that takes place in a James Bond film, you might consider that some of it's inspiration might have come from the 1979 film ""Moonraker"".

","Black Widow is the story of how the main female Avenger Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow, played terrifically by Scarlett Johansson (Lost in Translation) in this movie went back to her origins physically to prevent the scoundrels that were littering the world with other ""black widows"" - or girls under the control of a man named Dreykov - who could control the girls to do what he wanted them to do from his headquarters. Along the way Natasha meets up with her sister Yelena Belova played well by Florence Pugh (Lady Macbeth) who acts as a younger version to her older sister Avenger on their quest to make it to the ""Red Room"" - the processing room where the girls are taken in from the streets and are psychologically manipulated to do what Dreykov wants them to do. Natasha and Yelena's relationship throughout the movie is very funny - it is very much younger sister to older sister but in a cute sort of way. Also joining the pair of sisters on the quest are two other familial-like characters in Melina, played nicely by Rachel Weisz (The Mummy) and Alexei performed with some humor by David Harbour (Hellboy). It's an interesting combination of characters but it's one that's a winner for this movie!! This really is a good movie!! The action is second to none - Marvel holds the gold standard on knowing how to mix actual fighting with computer generated fighting and they were able to blend both nicely in this film!! All four of the protagonists that I mentioned kicked some serious butt in this film and it was fun watching them do so!! The acting was very good as well - this was not an easy story to tell having to go back into Natasha's past at times but it was done right and ended on a very positive note!! Cate Shortland did a terrific job directing this film by bringing all of the diverse personalities together to tell a terrific story!! Eric Pearson, Jac Schaefer, and Ned Benson all in someway contributed nicely to tell a cohesive story that was both fun and easy to understand!! Lorne Balfe did a nice job with the soundtrack, it hit its high points at the right moments and was soft and supporting when it needed to be!! Lisa Lovaas and Jany Temime did a nice job costuming both the superheroes and non-superheroes alike in this sci-fi flick!!

One downside is that even if it's a Black Widow movie, Yelena, Natasha's sister, steals the show a lot during the film. It's nice to see her, but I would've liked more Black Widow in the film. Really, whenever Yelena or Alexi are on screen, they steal the spotlight. The villain was develop ok, sort of, and so was Natasha's family. The action scenes in this film don't need some magic for sci-fi. It's like action from a James Bond movie, and it works well with this movie. Another issue I have with the film was that the start was pretty good, but the rest of the film just kind of falls. I also hated how they portrayed Red Guardian in this movie.

","'Black Widow (2021)' is one of the weaker entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's actually rather forgettable, to be honest. Set after the events of 'Captain America: Civil War (2016)', the film follows its eponymous hero as she teams up with her long-lost sister to take down the people in charge of the 'red room', the brain-washing facility that Natasha herself was forced into as a child. The picture starts out feeling quite different to the other entries in its franchise, with a somewhat dark tone and a 'Bourne'-esque vibe. Eventually, though, it deteriorates into the same formulaic sort of thing we've seen countless times from Marvel Studios, with big CGI set-pieces and forced-in humour. The comedy often clashes with the flick's tone and is, frankly, sometimes quite annoying, whereas the action is far too infrequent and intangible to be fully satisfying. Ray Winston's villain is also the most bland and uninteresting of any baddie in the MCU and, yes, that even includes Malekith the dark elf from 'Thor: The Dark World (2011)'. The film isn't bad, don't get me wrong. There are a few entertaining action scenes, the performances are all on point and the story is generally engaging. It just feels like a pretty passive experience, though. It isn't massively compelling and quite a few of its plot points fall totally flat. Still, it's enjoyable enough to be worth a watch once. However, I can't see myself revisiting it any time soon and, because of where it falls in the MCU's chronology, I don't think I really need to. 6/10.",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

There's a pleasing lack of the meaningless cityscape destruction that so often features in superhero films, and Marvel's trademark style of wit fits well in the action spy context. Fans of the tv show Alias like me may spot some of its influence also, and it seemed to me that there's more than sniff of a feminist take about this that works pleasingly (though of course women should critique that). Yes it's still quite generic (and, of course, overlong ... but not Endgame overlong at least), but the mix of genres definitely gives it a different feel throughout, to the extent that even Ray Winstone's absurd attempt at an accent doesn't jar too much.

Even the first shot with her in the first trailer is done this way. I really don't like this, and I honestly think it goes against any progressive ideas in the movie. If you wanted to make a movie about a bunch of women being freed from an oppressive tyrant, why would you objectify your leading actress so blatantly?

","A very generic and forgettable movie. Black Widow presents a terrible outcome for the character of Scarlett Johansson and totally bad and forgettable villains. The Trainer was MASSACRED to the extreme by the script and reduced to an ""Exterminator"" project. The script is very punctured and very weak. Crisp cuts and a very shallow and very forgettable soundtrack, like most Marvel movies. The second arc is totally sluggish and slow, getting tedious to watch. The third act is totally messed up and the Plot involving the Trainer's revelation gets to be pathetic and horrible, which makes him one of the worst villains in the cinematographic universe of Marvel. The final CGI is pretty bad. But, the film has mostly good visual decisions, an in-depth look at Natasha and Yelena and great action scenes, as well as being well-placed in the context between Civil War and Infinite War. Unfortunately, other characters like the Red Guardian are very poorly explored and show a horrible development, in addition to excessive cuts in some action scenes and continuity of the same.

","This was a great film! Sure, it did have its very minimal flaws, but in my opinion, it had more pros. The one thing I really liked was the family dynamics in the movie. Even though non of them are related, they all acted like a family in the funny, dysfunctional way most families do. A great example of that was the scene where they were eating dinner together after reuniting, it was hilarious. I also liked the bantering sibling rivalry Natasha and Yelena had, that was also very funny and reminded me of how I act with my sibling. I also though the supporting cast in this movie was some of the best in the MCU. I loved hearing all of them with their Russian accents. David Harbor was hilarious, I couldn't stop laughing at his scenes, Rachel Weisz was also great, but Florence Pugh stole the show, she was amazing, I can't wait to see what her future holds in the MCU. Another pro this movie had was its action. It was amazing. The fight scenes we some of the best in the MCU. This is my personal opinion, but I liked how this followed Civil War, and ended before Infinity War. This movie did a great job filling the gap in Natasha's story between those movies. This movies was also unique in a way. Almost every Marvel movie has cool animated closing credits at the end of the movie before the credits role. This movie did not, instead they decided to do something that hasn't been done since The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man 2 did it. They had opening credits. I had goosebumps watching the opening credits in this movie. It was so good, I didn't feel like I was watching a Marvel movie, I felt like I was watching a war movie. The way they made it look so real was breathtaking, it was definitely one of the stronger points of the movie, it was also important to the story. The last thing I liked about this film was Ray Winstone's portrayal of Dreykov. The character is so truly evil, and the role was played to perfection.

Why should cinematic heros be any different?) Great action, great CGI (mostly), good story, lots of humor, big production values, good acting. Of course it wasn't perfect. Spoiler alert: There was a 15 minute family reunion type event in the middle that was too long and too sappy. If I had known it was coming I could have used it for a bathroom and snack bar break.

I know this movie wasn't meant to be fully action-packed but the family dynamic just didn't work for me at all.

On the topic of the family dynamic, I will say it definitely wasn't because of the acting since you can see all four of them really trying their best in this movie. Florence Pugh, who plays Yelena Belova, for me personally was the real stand out of the actors in this movie. Whenever you see the ""family"" on screen together you can easily see and tell how everybody feels about this. Marvel has not been known to have the best villains but in recent movies, we've been getting some better villains but, ""Black Widow"" just brought back the terrible villain. The villain in this movie is just so boring and lacks motivation. It also doesn't help that the audience never sees them.

","I missed the opportunity to see BLACK WIDOW at the cinema and now I regret that decision. I thought it was going to be a forced effort, soaked in PC bull. It is a good action movie, with the sequences as good as you could hope for, and its family drama part at least resembles an effort of a human being. What I'm most impressed about is that Shortland managed to put her personal stamp on the project and still make a movie that belongs to the MCU (some of the indoor stuff reminded me of the Soviet cinema). Story and characters are believable enough that you care, which is, I think, a rare feat nowadays, especially in something as mainstream as Marvel. Harbour is a cliche, but an adorable one, Weisz is charming as always and Pugh continues to be a revelation and one of the better actresses to emerge over the past half a decade or so. The accent play left me ambivalent (Florence's hard 'r' comes and goes and I, as a Slav, am allowed to be a snob about it). I also don't know what to do with Dreykov's daughter (on that note -- when are we going to have an actual Russian criminal play a movie Russian criminal instead of all these Winstons and Brannaghs? I'm just messing with you -- I'm mocking these voices that have gained steam which suggest you can't do anything outside of what you are (if you're white, at least). Well, woke ladies and gentlemen of 2021, that's called acting and Ray makes for a convincing Russian roughneck (he even looks like one!) It's good to have a small-scale (super)hero stuff here and there -- it brings the things down to Earth, everything slows down and you can enjoy (and appreciate) the details (something I liked about the 1st season of DAREDEVIL).

","Black Widow is the worst MCU movie, infected by horrible and cringy writing. Where do I begin? This movie feels really out of date and completely unnecessary. The film deals with her past instead of making a methodical movie that breaks down the Black Widow program and its psyche. It does an MCU formula of big set pieces and end of the world stuff. This movie barely builds Black Widow. It tries to make her mistakes haunt her but fails. They tried to bring more compassion to her with her ""family"" but failed. The plot, in general, was never going to work. Instead of the story being character-focused, it decided to be politically focused. And I don't mind politics in movies, but the politics here aren't so well thought out. It's not only pandering, but it's straight-up bad. A woman antagonist would've been better, showing what Black Widow could've been if she wasn't an Avenger, a cold-hearted killer. The other characters are a waste of space in the movie, utterly useless, some plot-wise and some Black Widow-wise. The reason why it's not so rated low is cause some action sequences are impressive. The prison cell, the safe house, and even scenes with Taskmaster should never go unnoticed.

","The Marvel Cinematic Universe had its huge financial success with Avengers: Endgame, and then we had Spider-Man: Far from Home to continue the franchise, but we had to wait over a year for the next instalment, which brought back a departed character for her own solo adventure. Basically, in 1995, young Natasha Romanoff (Ever Anderson) and Yelena Belova (Violet McGraw) were raised in Ohio by surrogate parents, Russian undercover agents, super-soldier Alexei Shostakov (David Harbour), aka the Red Guardian, Russia's Captain America, and Black Widow Melina Vostokoff (Rachel Weisz). The family are forced to escape to Cuba, General Dreykov (Ray Winstone) takes Romanoff and Belova to the Red Room for training. Years later, Shostakov is imprisoned in Russia, while Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) defects to S. H. I. E. L. D. after bombing Dreykov's Budapest office, apparently killing him and his young daughter Antonia (Ryan Kiera Armstrong). In 2016, after the Avengers have parted ways (Civil War), Romanoff is a fugitive, escaped from U. S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) and flees to a safehouse in Norway supplied by Rick Mason (O-T Fagbenle). Meanwhile, Belova (Florence Pugh) kills a rogue former Black Widow but encounters a synthetic gas called Red Dust that neutralises control of her mind. Belova sends the antidote to Romanoff hoping that she will return to help her free the other Widows. Romanoff unknowingly drives off with Red Dust, she is attacked by deadly masked agent Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko) who wants the antidote. After evading Taskmaster, she realises that the antidote came from Belova. The two reunite in Budapest, where they are attacked by mind-controlled Black Widows. While escaping, Romanoff learns Dreykov is alive, and the Red Room is still active. Romanoff was haunted by the memory of detonating the building with young Antonia inside whilst targeting Dreykov. Romanoff and Belova evade Taskmaster and meet back up with Mason who supplies them with a helicopter. Romanoff and Belova break Shostakov out of prison to learn where Dreykov is, and he tells them that they need to speak to Vostokoff. On a farm outside Saint Petersburg, Vostokoff has experimenting with chemical mind control on pigs. There, Belova reveals that while they were not a real family, she believed they were so. Vostokoff admits she sent their location to Dreykov, and soon agents arrive and take them to the Red Room, an aerial facility. On the base, it is revealed that Vostokoff and Romanoff have switched places using face mask technology before they were captured, allowing Vostokoff to free Shostakov and Belova from their restraints. Meanwhile, Romanoff confronts Dreykov, who sees through her disguise. Romanoff learns Taskmaster is Antonia, who survived the explosion but suffered severe damage. Dreykov implanted a chip in her head, turning her into the perfect soldier, capable of mimicking the actions of anyone she sees, including several Avengers. Romanoff attempts to kill Dreykov but fails to harm him due to a pheromone lock installed in her and every Widow. Dreykov reveals that he controls Widows worldwide via his desk console. Romanoff intentionally breaks her nose, severing her nasal passage to avoid the pheromone, and then attacks Dreykov. Shostakov battles Taskmaster, while Vostokoff destroys one of the facility's engines, and Belova searches for the other Widows, who are controlled to protect Dreykov. Together, Shostakov and Belova lock Taskmaster in a cell. Dreykov escapes as the Widows attack Romanoff, but Belova explodes an antidote bomb that releases all the Widows from mind control. Romanoff gets into the control desk and copies the locations of the other Widows around the world as the facility begins to explode and fall. Romanoff retrieves the two surviving vials of the Red Dust and frees Taskmaster from the locked cell. Vostokoff and Shostakov escape in a plane just as Belova takes out Dreykov's helicopter, killing him. Romanoff gives Belova a parachute before battling Taskmaster in freefall. After landing, Romanoff uses the antidote on Taskmaster, freeing her from servitude. The freed Widows arrive as Belova, Vostokoff, and Shostakov say goodbye to Romanoff. She gives Belova the last antidote vial and the portable drive, telling her to free all other still mind-controlled Widows. As they leave with Antonia, Romanoff awaits Ross and his men, who have arrived to apprehend her. Two weeks later, Romanoff reunites with Mason, who supplies her with a Quinjet; she intends to free the imprisoned Avengers. In a scene set after Romanoff's death, Belova meets Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) at Romanoff's grave. De Fontaine assigns Clint Barton aka Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), whom she claims is responsible for Romanoff's death, as Belova's next target. Also starring Liani Samuel as Lerato and Michelle Lee as Oksana. Johansson carries the film as the superspy, Pugh is a welcome new addition as the no-nonsense assassin with deadpan putdowns, boorish Harbour and mysterious Weisz offer great support, and Winstone is a little pantomime but not a bad villain. This answers the question from Avengers Assemble about the infamous Budapest mission, it a good story with spies and mind-control, with a witty script, there are plenty of fantastic special effects-ladened chase and fight sequences to feast your eyes on, and it leaves room for emotional and funny moments (mocking the ""pose"" is a great in-joke) as well, a terrific superhero fantasy action.

","It has been awhile since the fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe have had a feature length film to enjoy, but after being delayed for over a year due to the pandemic, the public finally got to see BLACK WIDOW, the stand alone movie built around Scarlet Johansson's Natasha Romanoff, a former assassin turned SHIELD agent and then a member of the Avengers. Natasha made her debut in IRON MAN 2, and had been a mainstay of MCU films since. Though some fans have had problems with how her character was handled from one film to the other, Johansson's interpretation of the character created back in 1964 by Stan Lee, Don Rico, and Don Heck, developed a huge following, and of course, a demand that she get a solo film of her own same as Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, and Thor. When The Widow met her final fate in AVENGERS: ENDGAME, it was a gut punch of a twist, and seemed to forestall the possibility of a standalone movie, but Disney/Marvel found a way to give the fans what they wanted by making a film a set right after the events of CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR, where the Avengers were disbanded, and Natasha was a fugitive from the American government, and hiding in Europe for violating the Sokovia Accords.",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

Scar Jo does okay for her role but I expected to see a new dimension in her character and it never happened & she often got overshadowed by Florence Pugh's Eleyna who was just amazing & I am looking forward to her future in MCU.

","Before I get any hate for this rating, just know that I still really enjoy the MCU even if every so often, one of their films/shows falls flat for me. There is a lot of fun to be had here. This is the only Marvel film that had some good jokes and made me chuckle which is incredibly rare for a Marvel film. Florence Pugh and David Harbour bring a lot of great comedic timing to their performances that definitely elevates them from boring sidekicks. Their characters are actually interesting and feel much more involved in the story. I hope we get to see those two in the future again. Although their Russian accents do need a little bit of work. Scarlett Johansson is good. Her performance is fine. She doesn't do a bad job but there is a lot to be desired especially considering this is her final appearance in the MCU (film wise not timeline wise). Rachel Weisz was fine as well but her character felt very forgettable and bland which sucks because she just falls into the background whenever other characters show up on screen. The main villain is absolutely awful. It's honestly a contender for worst MCU villain. His motivations are almost nonexistent and he exists only to yell and exposit. The characters build up that he'll be hard to kill but he just kinda dies without the influence of the characters which really defeats the purpose of them mentioning how hard he is to kill. Taskmaster is an interesting side villain but ultimately contributes nothing to the plot except as closure for Black Widow's forgettable side mission. The action scenes are kinda bland. If this was an earlier MCU film it would feel a lot better but because the MCU has bumped out some great action scenes, this just feels flat and boring. The visual effects are really spotty. Sometimes they look good and sometimes they look really really bad but the visual effects are usually pretty good. The story is very forgettable. It revolves around Black Widow taking down the Red Room again but the sequence of events is so bland and forgettable. I can't remember some sequence of events relating to the story. It was nice to hear a little bit more about the Budapest adventure but it makes me wish we had got that movie instead of this. I placed this above Ant-Man but below Captain America 1 in my MCU Ranking.

The storyline surrounds Black Widow during the Civil War where she takes a hiatus to regroup with her sister and support a mission that they are both pursuing. They decide to break their father out of jail who happens to know the location of the villain's lair. As they work together it quickly becomes apparent why there is so much resentment for each other within the family and why a happy ending isn't likely. This movie is directed by Cate Shortland (Lore) and stars Scarlett Johansson (Jojo Rabbit), Rachel Weisz (The Fountain), William Hurt (A History of Violence), Florence Pugh (Little Women) and David Harbour (The Stranger Things). The family dynamic in this made for an impressive storyline way better than I anticipated. There is a dark cloud over the family the entire movie and doubt if they will ever overcome it...and the conclusion to that element of the movie was very well put together. The action was top notch as always and the CGI and battle scenes were fantastic. The cast delivered their characters perfectly.

","Okay, the header of my review is a bit harsh. But basically that's what Black Widow is. It further explores the background of Black Widow, one the earliest and most human of the Avengers. And since this character is an ass-kicking former spy with a murky past, comparison with the Bourne franchise is quickly made. Except that this is a MCU superhero film and therefore the action setpieces are totally over the top and somehow doesn't really suit the basic material. The interesting parts of the film are the more realistic scenes where we get to know Romanoff's past and some more down to earth fight scenes (and not the overblown finale). Johansson does a solid job but it are newcomers Pugh and Harbour that steal the show.

Some audience members may have appreciated a little better plot development in the beginning as scenes rapidly proceeded apace with the mental catch-up game for some people trying to figure out what was happening even as the opening sequences were nicely done as the action became quite compelling and original without super-hyper drive special effects. The movie then however became a little stilted with the hyper-action that seemed overdone and quite derivative using many action sequences done before in many movies. Yet the screenwriters, directors, and actors redeem themselves well with a powerful second half of the movie with nice double twists, humor, and emotionally touching interludes as a family or what might be called a family.

I love how Val is played out and Val as a character would persuade Yelena that it was Clint that murdered Natasha even though she sacrificed herself in end game since Clint has a wife and kids (that scene was sad).

","Binary reviews abound these days. Too many reviewers think that if the film they're watching isn't the best film ever then it must be the worst. This film occupies neither end of the scale. Yes it's all action, the plot is aimed at the brain-dead, the script is all too predictably formulaic, the effects are very cgi heavy and it's unlikely to ever win any awards for anything. It's a superhero movie and they all follow the same pattern so you ought to know what to expect. It's certainly not the best superhero movie ever and it's equally not the worst. It occupies that glut of movies in the middle that are adequate to pass a couple of hours with but you'll be unlikely to ever care enough to watch it twice. It actually has more a feel of an old Bond movie seeing as the titular heroine has no actual superpowers and the villain would look equally at home in a dormant volcano stroking his cat.",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

Yelena and Natasha are sent to the Red Room to be trained as Black Widow assassins. So begins the tale of how this family reunites with Scarlet Johansson as the adult Natasha and Florence Pugh as Yelena. They fight a Cyborg and the Black Widows (as well as each other at first), they even have to spring Alex from prison. Fight scenes both mass and duels are impressively choreographed with CGI assistance in skydiving bouts. The evil General Dreykov (Ray Winstone) even has a Cloud Base HQ and as many lives as a cat. A moving tale, the ""sisters"" aren't just out for revenge, they want to free all of the Black Widows from mind control. Some gaps in the chronicles of the MCU are filled in and future adventures are promised with some interesting plot twists.

","It's perhaps not entirely fair of me, but I think I would have given this movie at least one more star if it had come out before Endgame. It was an enjoyable action thriller set in the aftermath of Captain America: Civil War, filling in some details of what Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow got up to while the Avengers weren't exactly getting on. It has heaps of comedy and excellent performances from Scarlett Johansson as Natasha, scene-stealing Florence Pugh as her ""little sister"" Yelena, and hammy but hilarious David Harbour and morally ambiguous Rachel Weisz as her ""parents"". The setup was wonderfully done, with a young Nat and her ""family"" embedded as sleeper agents in the US but broken up when their mission ends. But while on paper the stakes were high, with Nat battling the resurgence of the Widow programme that produced her, which despite her previous efforts has come back stronger and even more exploitative, the story somehow still felt too slight to do the character justice when even on first watch we know what happens down the line. Still it was lovely to know that Nat had refound this family and particularly her little sister, and it was a great introduction to Yelena who we meet again in Hawkeye and will hopefully see much more of in future. And if you're lucky enough to have the opportunity to watch this before you've seen all the MCU Phase 3 movies, I'd recommend watching it immediately after Captain America: Civil War, and at least before Infinity War and definitely before Endgame.",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

And yes, I also agree that relative newcomer Florence Pugh is near impossible to look away from -- she has genuine big-screen gravitas, and is likely to go on to have a very rich and varied film career. I have read some incredibly vitreolic reviews and am floored by them -- just exactly what is it that has made them so angry? It is beyond my understanding. Filled with gorgeous men and women running around and having adventures all over the place, with little injections of humor and pathos here and there, not overdone, just right! Why would anyone complain? I had a ball, I laughed, I hid behind my hands, I bounced on the edge of my seat, and even shed a tear or two. A complete success of a movie, even if it was waayy too many years late in coming. Also, I love movies that rarely refer to gender, and don't try to push anything down your throat, and this was definitely one of those films. Gender-schmender! Who cares if the story is filled with mostly men or mostly women or anything in between? As long as the story gallops forward at a decent pace and inspires you to care about the characters. Yep, a total win! Don't listen to the nay-sayers, I am genuinely not sure what movie they watched.",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

","A this point superhero movies need to find something unique to go on (which is much easier said than done) because it's becoming really formulaic. Personally, it was a Marvel movie which you could swap the name with another and no one would know, there wasn't much uniqueness to. The CGI in my opinion was badly done, looked choppy and rushed. The characters were all female, not a single man other than David Harbour who in my opinion portrayed a Russian the best out of them all but whose onoy role was a comic relief character and not an actual standalone hero or villain to fight. I get they want to empower women and all that but this isn't how you do it. In all honesty, they are laughing at women in my opinion because if you need a movie with only all women to empower them then this is not representative of real life. If we get a movie of all women then men should get one too. The whole ending seemed like a way to shove the whole ""liberate yourselves women"" in people's face, it's just so blatant and unsubtle it makes you cringe. I'm a woman and I was rolling my eyes at these scenes. Scarlet Johansen didn't even seem like the main character of this movie tbh. Also, lack of action, I was getting bored. I felt like I saw a drama instead of a fantasy superhero movie. It was entertaining nonetheless, but not worth the hype at all in my opinion, as it has nothing unqiue or memorable about it and the one thing you watch these movies for, the action, isn't even really there.",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

","This was a solid film with a few inconsistencies and bumps along the way. Yelena and Natasha's dynamic is the emotional axis that this film revolves around, and in that respect the film does a great job. However, this movie felt like two different films edited together. Its opening credits were stunning, horrifying and emotional, and the first half of the film was action-packed and tightly paced. But what let this movie down was a poorly executed villain and a patchy finale. Taskmaster, while great conceptually, did not get nearly enough time for us to really appreciate the role she played in Natasha's guilt and haunted past. Freeing Taskmaster with the red gas was far too quick and easy a resolution, and felt underwhelming considering how much of a psychological threat she had posed to Natasha just moments before.

","In the immediate aftermath of Civil War, global fugitive Natasha Romanoff is on the run after acting in violation of the Sokovia Accords. With red in her ledger and nowhere to turn, she goes back to where it all began so to speak, reuniting with some old ""family members"" and delving into her pre-Avenger history, including her time in the notorious Red Room. This Johnny-come-lately Marvel saga starts off strongly and features a few well-choreographed, intense hand-to-hand fight scenes, some amusing familial squabbles, and an exciting climax, but even with all the anticipation and over-the-top action it doesn't quite dig deep enough into the central character's backstory to make it a very tense or compelling yarn, despite the efforts of Johansson who (expectedly) holds her own, or a good role for Pugh as Romanoff's sister figure. **½",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

The difference being that I quite enjoyed Rogue One, while it didn't further the grand Star Wars epic, I felt like it added flavor to those lesser people in the galaxy struggling to make a difference. Black Widow doesn't do that in the slightest, the only thing it serves to do is hit us over the head with some really over the top lessons on sexism. Lessons which I will continue to say are needed but good lord if we could have any sort of subtlety or natural discourse rather than just ramming in these ridiculous forced narratives into things in ways that only ever feel awkward and contrived.

","My biggest regret with this movie is not seeing it in the theater. In my mind Scarlett Johansson had every right to sue Disney over the streaming rights of this movie. The sound and special effects in this movie clearly separate it from the previous movies of Marvel past. This movie dives deep into the backstory of ""Black Widow"" something we only learned bits and pieces of during the progression of the Marvel story-line. This movie takes place after ""Civil War"" and answers a lot of questions between then and ""Infinity War"". The movie is action packed with some amazing fight scenes as well as heart felt. Actor David Harbour makes his Marvel Screen debut in this movie and his personality is seen very similar to that of what we see on ""Stranger Things"" he is the comedic relief in a more serious action movie. This movie themes around family, what it truly means to have one. An amazing film that is a must see for ANY Marvel fans out there. Of course your not a true Marvel fan if you don't stick around till the end of the credits.",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

","By tackling some hard-hitting themes of childhood trauma, loss of free will, family (or lack thereof), grief, and haunting guilt, Black Widow could've easily deceived us into believing it really justified its existence, hadn't it eschewed drama for comedy and action. What we got is a middling Marvel effort with a rehashed spy thriller story and its affiliated action set-pieces and plot clichés. Granted, that very spy flavour that bleeds into each act more and more evidently endows us with a couple of slick action sequences that are pulled off with aplomb. It's just unfortunate all of them are devoid of the slightest tension. While on the subject, there's no real sense of danger I feel each time either Natasha or Yelena are supposedly at risk, and The Taskmaster completely fails to prove an imposing threat, that's not to mention it's a villain that's clearly merely skimmed over, with the result of falling victim to the plot's mishmash of clichés. The humour isn't the worst, largely due to Pugh and Harbour whose chemistry elevates each scene they share a great deal. The third act feels the most superhero-y, with a fair share of explosions and CGI-heavy scenes that almost feel incongruous with the relatively small-scope MCU installment Black Widow aims to be. However, It's also here when we get some emotionally-charged moments where Pugh - yup, once again - and Scarlett get there moments to shine, serving a fitting send-off for our titular superhero. Moreover, all of these shortcomings can be tolerated given the joy one gets out of this movie. I was surprised how much time flew by minutes before reaching its post-credit scene that got me really pumped up to see what's coming next.",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

","Following the events of Captain America: Civil War, Natasha(Scarlett Johansson) is now a fugitive for violating the Sokovia Accords. Meanwhile in Morocco her sister Yelena Belova(Florence Pugh) still a red room black widow kills a rogue widow but comes in contact with a gas that neutralizes the Red Room's mind-control. She seeks out Natasha to tell her that the red room is still active and its leader Antonia Dreykov is still alive. They must confront their past and destroy the red room. The film is a decent attempt at a solo film. While at the same it was a huge mistake on Disney's part. Many of the scenes involving her family are entertaining and invest in their bickering. The red guardian(David Harbour) as sort of this wash-up deadbeat father figure is more part of the comedic side of the Film. He's a Russian Captain America reject who feels that he never got his big shot and was thrown away by his country. You feel for him but at the same time, you can't help but laugh at his performance. Along with Florence as Yelena is not as classy as Natasha she drinks, swears, and even pokes fun at Natasha for being a Poser. How they bicker back and forth between one another shows that they truly are sisters. Although is pretty funny. Rachel Weisz is also good as their mother figure Melina, but she's not all that relevant until much later. The Head of the red room is honestly a let down while the idea they try to go with is more of an intellectual and psychological villain you don't see any real threat it's more of want he represents and if they were to go darker and deep into Natasha past then it would seem more impact. The movie doesn't show her time in the red room. It is just more only talked about. Natasha honestly takes a backseat to Yelena, She feels sorry for herself the whole time, but you don't feel the same way as you should. Her one scene with Bruce in the age of Ultron seemed more impactful. That's clearly what their trying to go for is emotion as opposed to action-packed while there are actions in the film it's not that much of it it's more meant to be centered around the characters. The movie's overall generic people kept asking and demanding a black window movie, but the studio didn't wanna do anything because they didn't think it would've been profitable. However, so much time has passed to the point that the stigma for Nastsha's just gone now. It's way too late to feel the same way. If it came out three or five years ago not as many people would've been burned out by the idea of it. *Spoilers*The biggest major issue that fans will have with this movie is the taskmaster and how essentially the taskmaster here is not like the comic counterpart. The Taskmaster is a woman who has connections to Dreykov and doesn't really have a personality, more of a mindless brute that just follows orders with a computer chip embedded in her neck to scan movements not having the photographic reflexes & Memory. It was a uncalled for and unnecessary change that add to nothing, this would have been the perfect opponent for Natasha's to face throughout the entire film. Also, why would Dreykov have a vial of this mind-canceling gas in his hideout? The end credits hinting at Yelena going after Hawkeye doesn't mean anything because you're telling me that she and the whole world wouldn't know what happened to Natasha. That all the heroes wouldn't have told of the sacrifice she made along with Tony and Steve.",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

Unfortunately I was looking forward to an origin story movie for Natasha Romanoff but instead we get a family drama with more focus on her ""little sister"" character and an allegory of the Patriarchy. The biggest saving grace, aside from the action when present, is the comedy scattered throughout, which, as in any Marvel movie, can be quite hit or miss, but in this one they mostly landed for me. I'm also a big fan of David Harbour, so that helped.",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

","Maybe this was actually good because I was pretty excited to finally go back to the cinema, but it was better than I expected. Now I did have my expectations pretty low but it surprised me. The story isn't all that great or anything, there's some good little turns to make it more unique but overall pretty straight forward. There are some pacing issues but nothing that drags you out of the movie. The action, I mean it's high budget it was bound to be good, although some effects looked a bit , the action scenes are very well organised and choreographed. The movie does look nice overall, some odd placed camera angles, but visually impressive. Some of the comedy was put in wrong, it still got some laughs from the back row. The characters are meh, there is no real development for the character 'Black Widow', the development is based around the families relationship. Now this works pretty well actually, their chemistry is enjoyable to watch. I will say there are definitely some parts that rely on you to have seen the other movies, just a warning.

In this movie, we get a closer look into the black widow programme and what we learn is very interesting. Florence Pugh delivers a fantastic performance as Yellana, with Johannson delivering as well in the lead role. David Harbour is also a highlight playing Captain America, if he were a pathetic loser. In regards to action, this movie delivers with several exciting action sequences and fight scenes. However, this film really delivers with the story, providing an emotionally investing, character driven family drama, as well as a thrilling spy thriller.

When she needed to shine her spandex bottom, to say a quippy line or pose for a group shot - she was appreciated and remembered... by youtube's ""best of black widow"" compilations. But when it comes to origin stories or what can a character do on their own... Well, only one thing was important: that she was russian. So the movie isn't about her as a character. No, it's about her sister and her family. And it's not about her motivations or personality, it's about an evil ruski being an evil ruski. And the problem is... that ruski is probably the best character in the whole movie. And what he does is basically what USA has done for the past 50 years. So all the ""bad man is mad"" had no effect on me. In fact, I merely appreciated the actor's performance.

","Black Widow faced steep expectations as Marvel's first female-led film focused on a cherished MCU favorite. Black Widow's past was always shrouded in mystery and pain, but she was finally receiving the attention the hero deserved to dive into her past and celebrate Scarlett Johansson's super spy. With hopes high and fans wanting a Captain America: The Winter Soldier-type superhero espionage film, Black Widow, unfortunately, fell short. Nothing was particularly disappointing about the film. I had just hoped for so much more for the character and Scarlett Johansson at this point in the MCU's journey. The effects and action were decent. The villain was forgettable. The big defining Budapest incident was passed by with hardly any impact or emotional weight. Black Widow gets lost in all of the chaos of the film. The best part of the movie by far was the new characters played by Florence Pugh and David Harbor. They were highly entertaining, funny, and endearing. I hope to see Florence Pugh's Yelena Belova in many more Marvel films. Black Widow really was a decent entry in the Marvel universe and one of the better Phase 4 movies.

","The acting was solid all round, the score was also pretty good and the story was okay for the most part. The problem was the villains: Taskmaster who was marketed heavily as being the main antagonist turned out to be nothing more than a Winter Soldier knockoff with very little screen time. And the reveal of her true identity was very predictable after the Budapest flashback. The real main villain was so unimportant and uninteresting that I can't even remember his name but he was basically hiding in a flying fortress influencing world events with his spies and assassins from the shadows (which seems like a very overplayed plot point as it has already been used in The Winter Soldier with Hydra). Natasha's 'family' were a great addition, but I wish Red Guardian got an action scene where he wasn't just getting shot or beat up. There weren't really any stakes in this movie as the Red Room had supposedly been operating throughout the entire MCU and hadn't caused any real trouble. There were no heroic sacrifices or deaths of any of her 'family' which left little room for any character development that Natasha might have undergone in her own movie which is quite disappointing as this is the last time we will see her. The post-credit scene shows how unimportant this movie is in the grand scheme of the MCU when all it does is set up the Disney + Hawkeye show.

This film takes place just before Avengers: Infinity War and so we already know how her story ultimately ends which drains some tension from the story presented here. Sure, it's fun seeing her interact with the other members of the Romanoff family. I especially liked Florence Pugh (who doesn't apparently), she's going to make a great Black Widow going forward. As an average moviegoer who isn't steeped in Marvel lore, it was also fun getting to know Natasha's backstory. I also think the idea to bring in a Harvey Weinstein-ish villain was more than appropriate. It made the story more relevant to some important social issues. Ultimately, however, the movie suffers from that afterthought-ish nature I mentioned earlier. This feels less important than what we saw in the other Avengers movies.

To quote the god father ""look how they massacred my boy"" if you are a fan of the character you will be severely disappointed in this portrayal if you know nothing about this character than you will still probably be severely disappointed for how they cop out with the conclusion of the character they establish the second biggest sin of the film is they revel an absolutely amazing gut punch character decision through a back flash but once again the film cops out and pulls it punches the only pro this film has is the family dynamic involving Natasha and the supporting cast in conclusion the film advertised itself as gritty spy thriller like the newer bond films but in reality it just comes off campy and cheesy like the classic bond films minus the charm just go back and rewatch winter soldier.",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

Black Widow was always going to be hard to adapt on her own, because she's always been a supporting character in the comics. She doesn't have great material to draw from. The story in the movie is ambitious, but not well written. It tries too hard to mean something, when it's unearned in the script. The action scenes were well choreographed and filmed, but it suffered from a lack of suspense, because the villains are so terrible.

A solid actioner (some have opined it feels like Captain America: The Winter Soldier lite) which feels more of an obligation than something organic still manages to entertain beside itself since the only MCU product that's been seen has been the Disney + offerings so anything on the big black screen would be viewed almost as a rite of release than anything else. Pugh & Harvour manage to steal almost every scene they're in while Scarjo's cutaways have a 'this is my family' shrug to them but being this is essentially a sacrificial lamb for the Mouse House to see how their big performers will do in our current Covid nation, we could do worse (live action Mulan, anyone?).

Cate Shortland did a good job on clarifying events and ideas from the prior MCU films, while also doing a decent job on elaborating on a fan favorite character like Natasha Romanoff, but she definitely could've fleshed out the plot a lot more, making this film feel a little bit like a filler/setup, to the saga. With the events Shortland was telling, I feel as if this film was released a few years ago, it would've been more hard-hitting, and relevant, more than feeling a little redundant with not a lot of consequences.

","Master killer 'The Black Widow' (Natasha Romanov, played by Scarlett Johansson) is finally given a solo film, complete with back-story, as she reunites with her 'family' to take on a supervillain who controls an army of brainwashed über-assassins. The film, especially CGI/special effects and action sequences, doesn't add much new to the Marvel cinematic universe but the story moves along and there is some amusing meta-humour at the expense of well-worn hero-tropes (notably the three point power-landing) and on the oft ridiculed contribution of master assassin, but otherwise mundane, 'Black Widow' to 'The Avengers', a team that includes omnipotent supernatural beings, Gods, and Hulks. The script is a bit light-weight and quippy, especially when Romanov's father shows up, which makes some of the 'family bonding' scenes a bit uneven, but the two 'sisters' seem to have fun with their roles (Florence Pugh is quite good as Yelena). The opening sequence and credits are excellent as is much of the first half but the film falters somewhat when the action moves to the villain's improbable aerial secret-base and resorts to the much parodied shtick of the evil-doer carefully explaining his nefarious plans before an overly-long and physics-defying climatic fight. Other than some heavy-handed 'sister-hood' bonding at the end, I failed to see the 'feminist agenda' that some IMDB commentators seem fixated on. Having read a lot of on-line amateur reviews (such as the one I am writing), I was prepared for pretentious crap at the level of 'Captain Marvel' (2019) , so was presently surprised by this entertaining, if not outstanding, CGI-fest.",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

It is just unfortunate that it comes after her death in ""Endgame"" but as I said, this movie knocks it out of the park with its action scenes, emotional drama and also sets up for future MCU implications. The core cast all did amazing work! Most notable is Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova. Her character has grown to be a hardened assassin from childhood who you think would be very dry but Pugh still manages to have amazing personality and surprisingly great comedic timing. Johansson serves as a great driver of the film and foil to Pugh's assist which makes for a very fun dynamic duo. The film is overrall great and exactly the epic adventure we all needed to drive everyone back to the theatre. This is an experience that should be seen on the big screen for sure even though it is offered through the Disney+ app as premiere access.

Marvel clearly has a biased fan base much like Star Trek or Star Wars. Their is nothing wrong in a film for the hard core believers. This film was a train wreck. Poorly written, bad story, long and slow plot that was confusing. The movie created more questions and confusion than it answered. Suspending disbelief was exhausting. Scarlett was upstaged by her sister played by Florence Pugh. Her sister was a better Black Widow...better actor...more range and depth to the melancholic Scarlett that cannot carry a movie. Note they kill Scarlett at the end. We learn there are thousands of Black Widows so replacing the dull Scarlett was clearly set in motion. Florence Pugh would be much better and give the character some needed charisma. The movie felt like a Disney attempt to merge the Avenger Black Widow as a Hannah with the new black widows as a Disney Charlies Angels. It ended up having none of the heart of Hannah or the parody of Charlies Angels. Only Charlie is a psychopath Russian. In the end, the movie never explains how the Black Widow escaped the Red Room...just did so get over it.

There's not much else I really can say about it... I'm not a professional film critic and don't really want to deep-dive into the pros and cons, I just want to say that I think this is great and really stands up to the likes of the latest Thor and Guardians films.

Scarlett Johansson leads the pack here, in a stellar show that leads us to believe how she sacrificed herself in Endgame. The screenplay (by Eric Pearson) is packed with the right doses of situational humour, expensive set-pieces, and a worthwhile plot.

A crazy incident will occur and then the next scene everything will be fine and there will be no commentary on said crazy incident. In my theater pretty much all the comedy was a miss, it felt like they were going for a darker tone in this movie, which I was down for, but they constantly cut it down with humor that just wasn't hitting. The action was jittery and janky, I expect better from a huge company like Marvel at this point. For example the fight between Red Guardian and Taskmaster in the trailer looked awesome, but in the movie they constantly cut to other characters and you never got to see just pure uninterrupted action. Actually you did but it was Fast and Furious 9 levels of ridiculousness. The villains are TERRIBLE. Taskmaster fans are going to hate the character in this movie, they seriously butchered that aspect. Florence Pugh and David Harbour are two of the newcomers and I would say the two brightest spots of the movie & of course it's awesome to see ScarJo taking on the Black Widow mantle one last time. This movie should have been made years ago and it should have been made by passionate people with a genuinely great story to tell, instead it feels like they're telling a generic story here because they HAD to.

","We know Black Widow dies in endgame, so there are absolutely no stakes in the film, the only other likeable character in the film was the blonde woman, and she was obviously being set up for future films, so again no stakes. The action was always either really generic or over the top and unbelievable. The parents were uninteresting, 2 dimensional characters who were only there for comic relief and to further the plot. Taskmaster was a complete waste of potential, with absolutely no motive as she was 'mind controlled'. The suit was a generic, dark colored, 'edgy' suit, a big step down from the comic suit. Not to mention they took away her only superpower and replaced it with technology, yet another overused trope for Marvel movies.

The fight, the driving, the smart and the feeling she projected were not as great. For Yelena however it was mind blowing. It feels like they tried to uncool her in order to make us like Yelena more because she will replace her as the new Widow. The movie feels too much like a Fast and Furious to me.

Hence, I was somewhat disappointed as 'Black Widow' really had the potential to be one of Marvel's best (ever) movies, and yet did not meet my expectations. Although I have to admit that my (and many others') expectations were probably too high, after waiting so long for a new Marvel film (nearly 2 years) and with all the hype that's been building up.

","I should start by saying ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is my favorite MCU film and maybe that's why I enjoyed ""Black Widow"" so much. It very much has a ""Winter Soldier"" vibe to it and gives a political thriller type origin story for Natasha. The entire cast gives a great performance and the film gives us some of the best action scenes in the MCU to date. Towards the third act it becomes less Natasha's story and more setting up the possible future Black Widow character arc. It's a stand alone film that doesn't provide a huge amount of fan service like previous MCU films. I personally would have liked to see more flashbacks about Budapest or more storytelling connecting the Black Widow and Winter Soldier programs. The film succeeds without diving too much into either besides short mentions. My only complaint is the use of Taskmaster feels like the use of The Mandarin in Iron Man 3. Taskmaster is an iconic comic book character that deserves better and I hope Marvel better uses the character in future installments. It be very easy for someone else to get their hands on the suit and redeem the character. It's a great film and the post credit scene sets us up nicely for the upcoming Hawkeye series.

","With excellent performances and some great emotional depth, Black Widow may prove to be a bit uneven with it's execution towards the end- but it still manages to be a solidly fun and impactful superhero journey. To be honest, I expected rather little from this film. Considering all that's happened in the MCU recently with her character, and it's incredibly delayed release, I felt like the time had passed for a Black Widow solo film. Surprisingly though, I found myself quite entertained and moved by some of the moments of the film, and although it wasn't great, it did prove to be better than I had anticipated. By far the best thing about the film is Florence Pugh's performance as Yelena, aka Natasha's sister. Through her character we get a greater depth not only into a magnificently written character, but also the world of Natasha herself, and the pains that have burdened each of them for a long time. Strangely enough, in this marvel movie, by far the best moments are when it slows down and takes a time to tell it's story- as well as clear up the emotional depth each character has had to deal with. The action scenes are decent, nothing too special. I adore the costumes and really liked the films score. Towards the final act of the film, we seen to have a deterioration in quality though- it being just a bit too convoluted to have as much fun or as much as an impact as it could have had. In the end, I enjoyed Black Widow, it has its problems and it could have been better, but it also was much more refreshing than I anticipated- and that for me is a win alone.",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

","What's the best way to handle a movie where the lead character has already died in a previous film? Why should audiences care about the stakes when we've already seen some form of resolution? Black Widow as a film is a slippery story to shoehorn into an interconnected universe where the narrative is mostly moving forward, not stopping to give pause for past adventures. Some could say this circumstance is of Marvel Studio's (read: Ike Perlmutter) own doing: had we gotten a Black Widow film sooner, it can be almost conclusively agreed on that the story would've hit in a different way. While the movie serves to fill a gap of time between Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War, there's still some odd decisions made in the telling of the story, especially in the final scenes. Bracketed by scenes featuring the seemingly ever-present Secretary of State General Thunderbolt Ross, Black Widow is a story firmly centered on Marvel's second greatest spy: Natasha Romanoff. After being contacted by Yelena Belova, another product of the same Red Room we get glimpses of in Avengers: Age of Ultron, Natasha must simultaneously flee capture at the hands of Ross while working to bring down the establishment that made her.",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

","Subpar Bond that believes it has emotional stakes isn't exactly a very winning formula. Far too much bad MCU banter to go with something that wants to be grounded and quite frankly none of the actors are quite adapt at those sitcomy whedonisms that these movies made mainstream (Pugh in particular is terrible at those bits). Some of the mid section action is better than average as far as those movies goes but anything with Taskmasker is very bad and the big end is terrible. Winstone villain made me miss when people like Lonsdale and Lee made lousy Moore Bond plots half watchable. The major limitation is that far too much of the emotional beats depend on what characters talk about their time together when they were a pretend family and altough Johansson and Pugh have good chemistry and Weisz and Harbour do as good job as possible under the circunstances of selling their regrets, there just isn't enough downtime between plot needs to anything of it truly land. I can get what Shortland was hoping to import into one of those but little actually works even with the benefit of a far more standalone movie than most of them. Also, strange how after a decade of postponing giving Johansson her movie, they did one in which she so often feels like a witness/connective MCU tissue for the main supporting characters family drama that they had to give her an extra subplot with her guilty over ""killing"" Winstone's daughter so it can feel like she has more material to work with.

Since Natasha doesn't have superhuman abilities, the movie contains a huge amount of short-range combats and mirror-like dual that are intense to watch. Also, Natasha's family are introduced to the marvel universe, all played by skillful actor and actresses who provided the audience with laughter and resonance. The mystique of Red Room and Taskmaster is unveiled in Black Widow as well, as we get to see Natasha finally eradicating the fear of her origin. The only downsides I could think of are the heroes invincibility regarding car crashes and plane wrecks, and the confusing fragility of the antidotes. (broken by a punch yet surviving the plane crash?)

","First thing: HOLY CRAP DOES EVER EVER LOOK LIKE HER MOM! While unfortunately not as ravishingly beautiful as Milla was as a pup, I literally recognized her as Milla's child and had never even seen her before, and looked it up and sure enough, tada. WOW. Some very genetic Milla eyes! (I always felt Milla should have been cloned) . I also appreciate what they tried to do casting Natasha's sister, you want to get someone similarly proportioned, but don't want to outshine her, which could be difficult given Scarlett isn't your typical supermodel build or beauty. It would have been interesting to have seen Oleysa Rulin in the role. I tried my best to invest myself in the story, but it was a little simplistic and linear, and by the time they got around to doing anything significant I just didn't really care what was happening anymore. This sort of storyline concept would have done much better if it was drawn out into a longer television series, you could have put a lot more stakes on the whole ""mind control"" thing and ultimately made the rest of the ""widows"" into characters worth fighting, fighting for, and saving. Here they try to condense the concept into a film, but what happens is just volley of plot information followed by a bunch of action sequences and there is never much investment aside from the very forced attempt at the familiy drama surrounding Black Widow, Red Guardian and the fam. One of my biggest beefs with the decisions made making this film was opting to make all the characters speak with a poorly-imitated Russian accent - honestly, at that point, just have everyone speak English with their normal accents or whatever, because the accents were so poorly acted that none of the characters could develop any semblance of nuance, making them very cardboard-like. I really wanted to enjoy this far more than WW1984, but it was very comparably mediocre. It's like they just want to throw budgets at fluff and see who comes to pay for it, particularly with films of the superhero variety these days. Honestly, post-Avengers/X-Men/Thor it feels like the well has run dry and sadly the best of the superhero films from the major comic companies are behind us, and we're sliding into another superhero film dark age as the best the genre has to offer has now taken the form of TV series like The Boys and Jupiter's Legacy, which follow in the footsteps of great series like Heroes, Playstation Network's Powers and Netflix's Daredevil. Honestly Black Widow should have been a series, same budget, longer investment and more depth to the story. As is, it wasn't very interesting, and certainly was no better than one of the Hulk films, which were widely considered a bust (though personally I still very much enjoyed Ang Lee's).",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

And especially that hawkeye killed her was another thing of what the heck. When Yelenna deserted why didnt her body suit self destruct like it did for the other widow who dropped from high up and broke her back ? Why Taskmaster was played trough out the movie as a male and only when mask is off was female ? Also this bad guy protection system was dumb and only to get past it was to break her nose like that will prevent you do sense any smells. This movie just have too much things in it that makes no sense. Like why Natasha started fight with her sister when they first met ? Like is that some sort of a family reunion thing or something we didnt see it even when they were young. Never mind that there age different at the start of the movie was like few years only and in the end was like 10 years or more. Why was Natasha fleeing from US government ? Why didnt the taskmaster just attack Natasha in the forest where Natasha had her trailer ? How did the Taskmaster find her in the bridge out of nowhere when the Lada Niva dont have anything electronic in it other then it's radio ? Never mind that it's really weird to see Lada Niva in Norway. This movie is just full of nonsenss problems after problems.,/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

","Black Widow is a surprisingly hard movie for me to judge, not the least because it's the first Marvel movie we've had in two years now. I can't say I had particularly high expectations, nor can I say I was particularly disappointed. At the end of the day it's still a Marvel movie, and even the worst of them are hugely enjoyable experiences. Thankfully Black Widow, despite its problems, doesn't hit too close to the likes of Iron Man 3. It's still a thoroughly entertaining movie full of thrilling action, hilarious comedy (especially if you like Marvel's style), enthralling characters, fantastic performances, and reasonably dark subtext. In some ways it feels like a Phase 2 movie, but in others you can tell they're starting to attempt new things. I'm not familiar with Cate Shortland, but it's clear to see where her input ended and the Marvel machine's second unit took over, and her slower moments were absolutely the film's strongest points. The over-reliance on CGI and superhuman physics meant that as entertaining as the action was, it was just more generic Marvel affair that had no real consideration for characters' power levels or fighting styles (Taskmaster is all about mirroring moves, and yet we don't see any of this actually on display, for instance).

","And you know what? I expected it to be another thing, dunno why. Even when it's Marvel and it is always the same god-damned thing, with Natasha Romanoff I thought they could pull it off as a simple but effective action movie. Too bad nothing of that was given to me. What I got was a senseless plot, a pretentious dialogue wanting to belong to a family drama but failing and a CGI so bad it almost killed the movie by itself. For example, there's a scene a helicopter falls and crushes to the ground, as a pathetic attempt of making humor (hey, Marvel's trademark there). But how the hell do you pretend to be funny when the helicopter looks fake as hell and has CGI effects all over it? Come on, that was pitiful dude. When even the CGI is against you, you know you are in big trouble. Then, one of the main plot points of this movie are feromones. Yes, you heard right. And that plot point appears magically as a plot device in the moment to create some conflict, so it's completely stupid. The action sometimes is kinda interesting, I give the movie some credit for that, but the movie is way too long and way too talky, and in the end, for what? Just make a straightforward action movie Marvel, ok? Is that so hard? By the way, I don't wanna talk about the post credit scene, is one of the worst ass-pulls after credits I've ever seen. 4/10.",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

Lots of details about the making of a licenced-to-kill Widow, seem very Mk Ultra-ish. The brain-washing, sensory deprivation and lethal training sounded familiar- from every Spy and WWII film ever made- yet Marvel seem to give it a glossy new spin. But, instead of answering questions of Black Widow's past, it seemed to raise quite a number more! It even alluded to what happened in Budapest with Clint, but did not do any much-wanted backflashes! Amazing performances all round, surprising David Harbour comedy and Pugh's athleticism deserve a mention, along with Olga (Bond-girl) purposeful loss of face! End credit opens a hole into the next Phase for the Avengers, and the film firmly states that there is not just one Black Widow out there!

Yelena/Pugh is annoying most of the time. The character of Harbour is the most embarrassing and useless in the movie and together with Rachel Weisz they are the top one useless duo in the story. Their fake russian accent is ridiculous and their roles in the end are not even necessary. The role of the Taskmaster has been completely changed without reason. The cringe is a serious problem for 3/4 of the movie. The dialogues are not interesting, there is a very high risk of making the viewer fall asleep during more than one occasion (it happened to me). As a big marvel fan I can say that I am disappointed with this product, definitely not what I would have expected after all the waiting.

","It took the death of Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) for the Marvel Cinematic Universe to finally accord her the respect she deserved. In some ways, the solo Black Widow movie is too little, too late, a retroactive, long-overdue acknowledgement of the significance of one of the original six Avengers. Another way to see it is that it comes at precisely the right point in the timeline - with Natasha's death in Avengers: Endgame (2019) still a way off, there's no real mortal vulnerability in this film. What there is instead is emotional vulnerability. Natasha, a spy who's spent lifetimes putting up fronts and adopting new identities, begins her movie facing herself in the mirror and ends it by walking away with a newfound realisation of who she is.

","I knew the reign of superhero movies would come to an end, but I didn't think the first brick to fall would be Black Widow. The quality of the Captain Marvel movie may be an unexpected problem, because that character is so powerful, but Black Widow? No, no, she has a world of potential to explore, but what I just watched could really be thrown in the trash right away. The action scenes are acceptable, by Marvel standards, but the plot is really bad, is Natasha the main character or not? I don't see anything to prove that. How does she change throughout the film? Nothing. Oh I know that's her hair color. The music is so annoying, the supporting characters appear like scarecrows, it's really sad that the studio treats Natasha like that. Bland, sexualized, uninteresting.

This lead to the plot feeling very predictable and hackneyed, even for Marvel's standard. You know what you'll get when you go to a super hero film, but even this was dull.

","Black Widow (2021) is not what I expected. There were many things that bothered me with this movie to the point where I actually checked my watch a few times. I usually praise Marvel for their clever funny jokes but in this movie things are different. The jokes were not funny at all, a more adequate term would be lame. The concept of the story seems appealing but they messed it up big time to the point where I had no interest in the story anymore. There are huge problems with the pacing, the emotional connection and the overall plot is weak. There is a lot of talking and explaining stuff so when you finally get to the action scenes it's just some average random 0 emotional invested fights. The movie never actually takes the time to build a strong emotional side and this mistake backfires hard.",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

","This was not what I expected at all, I expected more of a movie with insane action throughout the whole movie, but this was unexpected for sure. I think the movie was pretty good, it fills in a gap in the MCU, the scale of the movie isn't really that big, but that doesn't matter, it's not trying to be really big. The cast did a great job but Florence Pugh and David Harbour stood out to me. The movie was really funny and mostly because of the two actors I just mentioned, there was a lot of jokes like most marvel movies these days have, it was pretty fun but I think all the jokes kinda took away from some of the seriousness. I like funny scenes and jokes in movies, but not to many, it does depend on the movie, and also I don't like to many unnecessary cheesy dad jokes, so they could have let some of the jokes be, but David Harbour does play a dad so it makes sense for there to be some dad jokes. I also didn't like taskmaster to much, many people were excited to se who was under the mask and even do I hoped it wasn't just a robot this wasn't really a good plot twist. I will let it go since it kinda makes sense that it is the daughter of Dreykov but I would have liked it to stay true to the comics, also I would have liked if we found out he got away and we may se him another time, because the concept of the character is really cool, and it would be interesting to see him fight some of the other Avengers.

Taskmaster was a diabolically depicted and had more to do in the avengers video game. I felt like the reveal of their identity was lacklustre and I'm sure most people guessed who they were before it was revealed. Dreykov suffered from a lack of screen time but I felt like he was good in his scenes. The movie felt like it came too late and knowing how Natasha dies already takes away some of the tension as you know that she can't die. The new characters were great. The red guardian and Yelena. Overall, Black Widow is a great movie and I would highly recommend!",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

It's called ""Black Widow"" and meant to be a send off for Scar Jo as Nat, but it instead feels more so like an introduction for Florence as Yelena (who was the bright spot of this movie for me along with Red Guardian to a lesser extent).

Taskmaster is turned into a victim. If the writers weren't obligated to tell fans the long-awaited story behind Budapest, the character and story probably would've gone a different direction and for the better.

","I am completely shocked by the many negative reviews and many of their points are unfounded and basically dumb. Now I'll be honest, I wasn't super excited about this film as Natasha was never my favourite (purely for lack of screen time), and she's dead so what does it matter? Turns out it matters a lot. Black Widow is a great return to marvel movies after a two year hiatus and is exciting and engaging throughout the whole two and a half hours. Scarlett Johansson is still incredible as Natasha, but the show gets stolen by Florence Pugh's Yelena. The relationship between the two sisters is one of the many joys of this movie and Yelena's witty sarcastic comments provide hilarious breaks between the action and more heavy themes of the movie. An hugely entertaining movie for the entire 2 and a half hours, it definitely stands out as one of the best solo films to date. Don't listen to the reviews calling it overly feminist- just because a movie has women in it doesn't mean that it's pandering to any agenda. Just because there are powerful women doesn't mean it's tokenistic or over the top.

Also I have to add the ""Smells like Teen Spirit"" Cover is amazing. However as a big Taskmaster enthusiast, I was pretty disappointed with what they did to her.

2268,12 July 2021,dbarne-65712,1," Poor send-off for a major character
","*Spoilers* Ultimately, this movie is a serious fail, in no small part due to the overwhelming social and political messaging which serves as the backbone of nearly all interactions. Before getting to far into the negatives, this movie does have the usual dose of Marvel action, stunts, and witty one-liners, but beyond that it's bogged down by its own self-righteous Indignation. The opening scene draws in, but feels forced, not flowing as one would expect given the interesting concept. The opening credits sequence struck somewhere between horrifying shock value and an ASPCA commercial only missing the pictures of sad puppies and the song ""In the arms of an angel"" playing in the background. The frequent time jumps and location swaps were handled somewhat poorly often failing to explain why things were happening and leaving the viewer an overall feeling of being unsettled. Rachel Weisz's character felt very poorly developed which was shocking for a film of this caliber and an actress of her capability. David Harbour's character was also a huge let down as despite the comic tie-in, he is poorly developed as a character and seems stuck in the well-meaning borish oaf category. The villain was underwhelming, the final setting too fantastic; but ultimately the biggest failure was the forced social commentary which seems to be taking over much of Hollywood. In the age of the ""me-too"" movement, social commentary is accessible and appropriate in many areas of life, I am just not sure it always works well in entertainment. The Marvel movie ""Black Panther"" was very well done, and the social messaging throughout the movie, though prominent didn't take away from the story or entertainment value. The movie ""Captain Marvel"", while trying to pull off female empowerment left the main character in limbo somewhere between roll-model and one-demensional social justice warrior. Likewise, the female empowerment moment near the end of the movie ""Endgame"" was so formalized as to almost feel forced and condescending. That's not to say the issues being touched on are not important, merely that that there is a time and place for everything and in entertainment they need to enhance the value not undermine it. This was by a fair margin the worst of this trend and distracts or undermines the story, plot development, character evolution and eventually the movie as a whole. Not worth the increasing prices to view for what ultimately feels like a really beautifully rendered social justice lecture. If this is the new Marvel model, it might be time to find entertainment elsewhere.",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

This idea that CGI stunts can ignore the laws of physics is infuriating. Good CGI bends the laws of physics to the level of 'far fetched', but not beyond. Atleast a dozen times the film makers flew too close to the sun and from the half way point on, it was akin to watching fast and furious 10 (or whichever number they're up to now). The only reason I haven't scored this lower is because of the occasionally humourous moments. IMO The worst of the MCU films, with Shang-chi, Iron man 3, and Thor 2 following just behind.

Widows in the Marvel world face an unenviable fate: they are programmed to kill, made guinea pigs, self-destructing if they fail their missions, controlled by the megalomaniacal central antagonist Drake (Ray Winston). Natasha managed to escape, the others, including Elena, were not lucky at all.

The comedy in the script gets out of hand as comedy and jokes appear at bad times. It's as if a boardroom made this film at times.

The death of my sister in MCU has been brewing for two years. The movie fans' sentimental feelings for the past and the MCU fans' reluctance and nostalgia for my sister's death make it difficult for us not to insist on watching this film with sadness. The whole film is full of tears intermittently. Every time I think of my sister as a dead person, I feel sad and hopeless. The first generation of Avengers ended.

The worst about this movie was the story of it. The characters development was also a mess! I kind of got some feminism vibe ( hating man) from this movie because this movie only had three men in it. One of them was nothing only a supporter to natasha. Second one was the re guardian! If you ever read the comics you would probably know that he is so powerful but they made him a total clown in this movie. And the third was the villain of this movie they also made him so powerless in this movie. They also changed the origin of Taskmaster he was a man born with the power! But instead day made him a woman and changed the whole story, i mean that's fine by me if they only make him a woman but still is stick to the origin of the character from original story. This movie had a great potential to be one of the best Marvel's movie but instead they ruined it. What are the best thing about this movie was the cast of this movie. Scarlett Johansson ans Florence pugh were amazing! I loved the whole chemical from them diva perfectly casted David Harbour also played a good act.

It really seems this film was churned out to give the fanbase a Black Widow film in which it asked, simply to get it out the way. Parts were funny, some intense action scenes, some emotion. One thing in the whole film stood out and it has nothing to do with Black Widow - the person the film is based on. It has everything to do with Florence Pugh. I liked her in this film and I am excited for her involvement in future films and TV shows. To this date she seems to be the only reason to watch Black Widow not just because she's the best part but everything else is disposable. In everything since, she's the only thing that's been recognised in the Universe so far with importance. I'm sure this film will be forgotten. Just another below average film from Marvel.

","Okay uhm, we started great but then something happened and we just got to the point where there was too little time to fit in the final conclusion to the movie. I like the Black Widow and I enjoyed the backstorie but they could have shown a bit more of her in the Red Room and how she escaped from it. They only tell you that she tried to kill the creator of the Red Room and that he is still alive and they need to go finally stop him. That is your entire plot for the movie, there is no focus on the villian until the end and no fear when you see him. He didn't appear as a villian but rahter a dying old man wanting to create a army.",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

","Overall, I thought that this movie was disappointing. I thought the action scenes were not as good or as intense as they could have been. The teasing the sisters give each other, I thought, was somewhat subdued. More so than I've noticed real sisters do to each other. And near the end Alexei/Red Guardian basically has the floor mopped up with him by the tool of the film's bad guy who has the same skills if not more so as the Black Widow has. He was unable to throw a punch during the fight. And the bad guy in the film comes across as a mafioso which I don't think helped the film at all. With that said it's good to see Rachael Weisz-one of my favorite actors by the way-on the screen again.",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

Don't even get me started on the dining table scene that entire scene could have been edited out except for the part where Melina shows them how she has been controlling the pigs. The only character that made the flick worthwhile was the villain Dreykov, portrayed the antagonist brilliantly but even he couldn't salvage the sinking ship. Just when u think Hollywood can't do worse than space jam they come up with this filth (black widow). I would suggest u refrain yourself from watching this masterpiece.

I was expecting more flashbacks like Budapest but they never lived up to my expectations. The third act was litteraly a joke it was just POOR and overexaggerated.

","I was going into the movie expecting the same old generic Marvel movie, but instead I got more than that.. in some ways. I'm very happy with the result. This movie is not only a great Marvel movie, but a good movie altogether. Because, unlike a lot of Marvel movies, it does feel like there are stakes, a key thing missing in a lot of the MCU. Part of that is because of the Spy/Thriller elements to this movie that keep the tone darker when necessary, and incorporate some good sets, but also because of the heart and emotion in this movie, that is conveyed through the trauma each of the main characters have to deal with (somewhat), and their connectivity as a ""family"". Each of the characters do have a lot of the witty humour, but it doesn't come across as being so formulaic here, instead it's actually funny and only used appropriately. Along with that the characters are individual and each have real stakes in the story, although most are lacking proper depth. This movie also has a lot of really engaging Spy/Thriller elements, more akin to the Mission: Impossible films, which gives it a more unique tone for an MCU movie and makes for some great action sequences. The main villain serves his purpose in the story, and provides a shadow of mystery and a looming sense of threat, before he is introduced to be ruthless and cold, making for a decent antagonist. However, what brings this movie down is that it presents so many potentially complex and dark themes, but as usual with the MCU, it doesn't fully engage with the concepts presented, and thus gives the characters less depth. Other than that, this is a solid action flick that goes beyond most Marvel films and is sure to entertain.",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

","I am a big fan of Marvel movies and I have watched them all several times. In short, does this movie do black widow justice? No. And how could it? This is basically an origin movie to a side kick character that we already know dies... If this movie was launched when it should have... After Civil War, the impact would have been much different. And this is how I took it. I saw this movie, as if she was still alive in MCU, and this was a representation of what Natasha has always been... A support, a rock to anyone fighting beside her, while she struggles to make right for her past. Except that in this movie.. she finally does ( and we finally know what happened in Budapest). I think this is why so many take it as if she is the sidekick. Also, I wont lie, this movie is meant to give us a ""replacement"" to black widow. But Yelena is a badass and will be very exciting to see. Still the fighting/action scenes are quite nice. People are complaining but let's be honest.. weren't many Marvel movies predictable? CGI heavy?? Finally, the complaints about the villain... This villain isn't meant to transpire outside this single movie... People are asking Loki level.. Thanos level villains.. are you crazy?? You dont put a villain that literally required the Avengers to be formed, or reborned.. in comparisson to a simple human-villain, that in fact exists (which makes people just generally uncomfortable, unlike an alien villain-human trafficking is the no 1 business in the world and most are girls). At the end, the movie is great, it just gives us more of Natasha being Natasha, it gives us a release to know that she was loved by a family before the Avengers, it gives us fun action and a bit of that Marvel comedy sequences. She would've deserved this movie after civil war and a proper send off with a sequel but alas... Female hero movies are still an uphill battle.

","Black Widow, a film released in 2021 exclusively on Disney+ was received fairly well upon its announcement, and it was obvious that fans were excited for the standalone story of Natasha Romanoff. Initially I had no intentions of watching this film or even taking a sneak peek at it. Why, you ask? Well it startled me why a Black Widow film was necessary and in the process of production after the character's death in Avengers: Endgame, however quite a lot of source material including the new villain Taskmaster hadn't been adapted from the comics, so bringing these characters canon to the Marvel comics was a nice edition to the collection of an increasingly expanding cinematic universe.",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

Her child background is fantastic. It describes why a person becomes very careful in trusting people. She barely knew her mum and she learns how to fake herself when she's still a child. I think it's very touching that she actually found someone to hold onto which is her fake sister, which also comes from the same background as her. That's how she develops this human traits that we all have which we called sympathy. The story kind of make me feel like it's very deep and emotional. It makes me feel like Natasha is the real heroes of all. I think the cinematography is well depicted for a person who's not an expert but somehow, it's really entertain my lockdown mood.

Like at the beginning, it was everything i could've hoped for. It had great pacing, pretty good cinematography and fight choreography, and I actually really liked the music. It's just that...as it went along, it started to get really dull and honestly, by the end, it just gave me headache. I was just so not that invested in the story and it didn't do a really good job at actually making me care for the characters. It wasn't bad or anything...it was just weird and it didn't really do anything new. It was pretty tonally inconsistent too and it made me think to myself ""wait what am I watching again?"". By the end, it just became a huge mess as the music started blaring louder and louder with every explosion...there were a lot of explosions and it got really loud. Honestly, i'm not even annoyed or anything because the movie's still watchable and you can still have a good time with it...it just felt really weird and something felt really off with it. It actually had some great ideas too but the film executed them really strangely and honestly, it just left me really really confused throughout the entire third act. Like there was no substance or anything, there was no plot twist, no crazy reveals or anything, just a few moments that made me go ""hey, that's pretty cool"" before reverting back to my neutral state of not really knowing how to react. I don't think it's as bad as everyone's saying it is, it was honestly fine. I just wouldn't go to the theatre to watch it and it's really more the kind of thing you can watch just on your computer at 1AM because you have nothing better to do.

Way less action packed than the other MCU movies and the CGI is just meh. The plot is so predictable and sloppy, very flat storytelling.

Black Widow and her extremely dysfunctional family are incredibly engaging and the actors do a good job bouncing off of each other. Unfortunately, a movie that would have benefited from a smaller scale is hurt by the studios need to have big stakes and thus the third act turns into a real mess as all the well done character work takes a back seat to action that is at times hard to follow and mess. It can also be riveting, as one fight scene showed. As well, a few good character moments are undercut by Marvel's continuous need to add in humor because they think the same joke told 50 times is still funny. As well, the main villain isn't too captivating and his main minion suffers from the same lack of personality that the Winter Soldier had. The CGI at the end also looks really dodge and hurts the movie. And finally, this movie should have come out years ago, not after this character was already gone. Now, all that being said, this is still fun and humorous movie that is brimming with good character work it's first two acts and the last act is merely mediocre.

In the comics, Taskmaster singlehandedly defeated the Avengers because of his abilities and skill yet now he is an automaton programmed by watching TV to learn his skills.

2900,10 July 2021,Thiccthightera,8," A few problems but Stellar
","Few spoilers ahead. If you haven't watched the movie beware I'm going to spoil it for you. Overall Black Widow was an action packed block buster that is a must see for the MCU. At the beginning of the movie this is the most tragic and sorrow filled back story that lasts about 10-20min. The middle of the film is very very slow but necessary for the plot that we knew wasn't going to be a Iron Man film that's almost all action. Some of the CGI was bad but is acceptable considering what the CGI is used for and can be looked past considering its in a few minutes of the film. As we know that the MCU is not going off comic book accuracy and shouldn't be because of how fresh their takes are in the MCU. Between the family bonding you see in the film between Red Guardian, Maria, Black widow and her little sister it makes you feel the emotion through out the film. Between the wonderful song choices and the color choices in many scenes it makes you feel connected with the movie all through out. With the gender bending of Task master and how her ""powers"" are explained is super fresh and interesting take on this comic book villain. The problems with this movie is that the tricks used are already used in multiple films with Black Widow in them, such as the face disguise as we saw in Captain America and the Winter Solider and then the electric gauntlets like in civil war, the CGI is acceptable with has obvious it was but for marvel movie it was still amazing. Another complaint of mine is that this movie is set in 2016 after Civil War but Natasha is more seasoned in combat than her appearance in Infinity war and end game. It is upsetting that Black widow is no longer in the MCU but her character was amazing in this movie.",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

","This movie had the potential to be up there with best of the MCU, but failed. We had been waiting for a solo Black Widow film since Iron Man 2, and there was already a story to be told. We knew how much Natasha had gone through what made Natasha herself, Marvel here had the groundwork to create a beautiful character piece not only about BW origin, but also to be a movie about how in simplistic terms you're able to learn from your past and not let it define you, in doing so you can grow as a person. I think what makes me so mad is that within the movie all of the groundwork that had been laid was up and abandoned Natasha was haunted by her past, specifically we hear about her ""ledger"" firstly in Avengers. Loki tries to expose her brokenness, touching how red her ledger is, Clint, Drakov's daughter. Loki wins Natasha breaks turn having a mental breakdown, then...she turns and thanks him for the cooperation. Natasha knows how broken she is and how much she has to her name, but she's grown Clint saw something in her how truly good she was. But in Black Widow, Budapest gets 2 minutes of screen time and the endless bloodshed that haunted Natasha for so long gets turned into a joke. That's all you need to about the writing they don't care anymore and of course we get 3rd act CGI festival also Natasha should've died at least 15 times from falling, but she dies in the future so who cares right?

From a story standpoint, I wish the film would have gone more in depth about the Red Room and Natasha's background. I know this wasn't an origin film, but I think the movie would have benefited from greater explanation of the Red Room (instead of pictures describing it). I had high hopes for Taskmaster coming into the film as he is a beloved villain of mine. My only critique is the short amount of screen time we got from the character. The supporting cast of David Harbour and Rachel Weisz did an excellent job and provided some laughs. Overall, it was a pretty average MCU movie that will be worth watching when it pops up on TV.

","Black widow is a film that shows that Marvel doesn't have any merit sure the family dynamic is good and the comedy mostly lands but the thing is that when Natasha goes into her old safe house it's never shown visually that someone might be in there with her instead we are told, also the opening of the film is amazing it's so bold, raw and most importantly it feels real but then we go from there to Synthetic gas that can bring someone out of mind control and an Oder that can prevent violent action being done to the person what? Also this film has extremely bad CGI and the actors are weirdly photographed in a few scenes and this film didn't need so much CGI they could have shot in an actual field talking about the fight with taskmaster also the film is very afraid to delve into its themes and taskmaster became a one dimensional villain with a very deep connection to Natasha's past that is never focused on that much also by the end it's weird that all is forgiven by the end and I really do think Marvel should stop with third act explosion it's getting old do something new something fresh, Feige Get Filmmakers to express there visions instead of you calling the shots let them and stop giving us the same thing again and again and something that is one note and doesn't commit to it's themes and is one note.",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

","I'm not a Marvel fan, so maybe that's my problem. At the same time I didn't go in with any preconceived notions of what these characters should be like, and only developed an opinion on what I expected from them based on what this one film was telling me and was very disappointed to find out it lied to me at every turn. The family stuff is only a front for the completely nonsensical plot this film has. The only thing that puts the two sisters together is illogical choices and huge amounts of plot armor. The main character is wanted for some crimes that are talked about on the radio and that have her heading to a safe house. Yet, when the plot of this movie kicks in, she behaves like she doesn't have anything to worry about because she doesn't know anything about what her sister is involved in. Fortunately, everyone who want her for whatever reasons that deal with her specifically keep their distance, and the only danger to her is from the people who are after her sister, allowing her to just travel all over the place and only get attacked by her sister's enemies. While I do get the sense that she and her sister are top-notch fighters, I thought they were humans. Actually, I looked it up and they are. And, yet, the insane amount of damage they survive turns the actions scenes into a joke and the villain, who makes a very impressive entrance, ends up being defanged rather early due to not being able to cause any sort of damage to these indestructible heroes. And it's not for lack of missing the target. I think Natasha alone gets blown up at least twice, her sister at least once, while also falling from insane heights, thrown around like rag dolls, and sprayed with bullets. Meanwhile, from what I can see, the younger sister has the means to create an army of ""sisters"" with the MacGuffin. The woman who had the MacGuffin even told her to do that. The only reason her and Natasha team up is to bolt Black Widow onto the story when, in fact, as intelligent as these women are presented, neither Natasha or Yelena would have made the choices they did to team up. And if they had, they would have been killed or captured long before they could even lay eyes on each other. Not to mention that the Black Widows as a whole have the rather unfortunate habit of just announcing their presence in the most loud and destructive ways possible wherever they go. They should be plastered all over the front page of every major newspaper in the world. And, finally, there's a reason this movie is more popular among females. Well, I'm a female and I have your back, males. No one is sexist who complains about these super heroes. The movie just forgot to tell anyone that these super heroes may be female, but not they're not female humans, no matter what they say.",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021

The other films of the saga very often fall into the very forgettable. We do not know how touches their subject in an interesting way, as was the case at times with Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Black Window is on this point above, almost reaching the top of the basket, a story sometimes unexpected, sometimes unsurprising. A tribute to james bond femme fatale version, we feel the potential to touch strong subjects such as the abyss of destructive patriarchy. Yet full of good ideas, the film does not really manage to treat the whole and become a master stallion, whereas with a little more time and less unsightly spectacular, when the family reunites before the final confrontation, the film shows that he could have been very strong. Instead, he hovers over, gives compelling reasons to connect the pieces with the saga and ticks the boxes of the blockbuster marvel without conviction. This is how the film scuttles itself, not knowing how to take these distances with Avenger. In fact it's a bit of a mess, but at times it offers a real good time, special mention to Yelena Belova, actress Florence Pugh is really what we will remember.",/review/rw7186440/?ref_=tt_urv,Black_Widow_2021
