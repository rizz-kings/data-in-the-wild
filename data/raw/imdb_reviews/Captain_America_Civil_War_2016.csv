","What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

8,23 November 2020,SebMoz,8," Excellent character dynamics
","Captain America: Winter Soldier was everything I wanted from a superhero movie. It was well directed, written and acted, and I was very excited for the next Captain America movie. And this movie most definietly delivered in quality. Is it as good as its predecessor? No, definietly not. There are a few flaws, which I'll talk about later. With that being said, this movie gets 4 things right for every one thing it does wrong. The plot is engaging and for the most part easy to follow and the pacing is solid. The characters all feel very 3-dimentional and fleshed out, and none of them feel different from what we already know. The movie's biggest strength is the interactions between the characters, and the different arguments presented by both sides. I love that despite obviously wanting us to side with Cap's team, the movie doesn't really make one side the ""correct"" one. Both sides present reasonable and logical arguments, and there is no right answer to what the Avengers should do. The new characters such as Black Panther and Spiderman are both very interesting and compelling, and both feel like a natural inclusion to the character list. All this is of course helped by some excellent performances as usual. The direction and cinematography are also both really good, and the action scenes are almost just as good as in Winter Soldier, even though some feel a little meaningless. And, while it might not be a big deal, MAN was it good to see a truly great antagonist in Zemo. He's well written and very well played by Daniel Br√ºhl, and he challenges the ideological perspectives of our hero in a way no other villain in the MCU has done before. With that being said, his plan is somewhat ridiculous, and felt a little too complicated. The movie also feels a little dumb sometimes. It feels like Cap and Stark could've solved the issue much sooner had they just communicated better. Those are my main complaints, and while there are a few other things I could nitpick, nothing really ruins the film by any means. It's a more mature take on the Marvel formula, and while it's the best movie in the franchise, it's still more than good enough for me to recommend it.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

16,12 April 2016,gangstah_vino,10," Now this is a good superhero movie!!
","Hi,  I saw civil war and I come with good news; it's AWESOME!  Im not gonna spoil one single thing, since this movie should be seen by  only the two trailers you probably saw. Don't watch any tvspots after  the second trailer or whatever!  Im gonna touch a few aspects and rate them.  Acting: Of course it's amazing. The characters we were waiting for were  black panther and of course SPIDERMAN! Both were done amazing!  Spiderman has a bigger role than I personally expected and it's done  with grace. Love it. Black Panther was such a good character with great  motivation why he's doing what he's doing. The acting per usual from  the other characters were great! 10/10  Story: Now where another (let's leave it) unnamed superhero movie  failed this year, and no I'm not talking about dead-pool.., was the  story. Now this story is what I expected from the other unnamed  superhero movie. I didn't know what side I wanted to be on; cap's or  iron man's. I was so conflicted and even while they're fighting you  don't know who to root for. The villain in this movie felt a bit, not  really out of place, but unnecessary in my opinion. But Marvel always  struggles to find a good fleshed out villain except for Loki & kingpin  in the series. 8/10   Action/Cinematography: O boy..If you're an action freak you will love  this, if you're a comic book fan.. you're gonna LIVE these amazing  action set pieces. The much anticipated airport scene is AMAZING.  You've seen nothing, literally nothing of the amazing action that will  bestow upon you guys. The airport scene is in complete imax and has a  runtime of around 17 minutes. Just let that sink in! The Russo brothers  know how to create great action and film it great as well. I can go on  record and say this is by far the best superhero action scenes ever.  20/10.   Verdict: Was it a perfect movie? No. But for me as a fan it came darn  close. The only thing that bothered me were the villains, well actually  one of the few that are in there.   Was it better than... Batman v superman.. yes by far. I mean we're in a  comic book movie year, so we might as well compare it. Batman v  superman lacked in a lot of places and civil war just did it better.  Just the conflict in ideologies made it so much more believable why the  characters fought and because this whole story arc is happening now  after 2 cross over movies, 3 iron movies and 2 cap movies.. the stakes  are so incredibly high. I tried to compare dead-pool with it as well,  but it's a different movie in terms of it being a solo movie and  setting something up, instead of showing a conflict between good and  good instead of good and evil.   9 out of 10! Near Perfect movie for the fans(9.5) and a good solid  action film for the general movie go-ers(9)",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016
17,14 May 2016,Genti25,10," Marvel are on a roll.
","Captain America Civil War is the thirteenth film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, with a screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely. In Captain America: Civil War, disagreement over international oversight of the Avengers fractures them into opposing factions - one led by Steve Rogers and the other by Tony Stark. Civil War is definitely one of the best Marvel movies to date, and absolutely on par with The Winter Soldier which was also great. They are both on top in the Marvel Cinematic Movies ranking of mine so far. The conflict between these well beloved characters is done in a brilliant and fantastic way by the amazing Russo brothers who took the cheese out of the first Captain America movie , made one serious and great second movie, and build upon them both with the third outing. Everyone does a great job here, Chris Evans has made Captain America his own same as Robert Downey Jr for Iron Man. It features a very big ensemble cast and not one of them is anything less than great on the role. The fight scenes are also some of the best ever made in a comic book movie, even better than in The Winter Soldier. Especially the airport scene is just mesmerizing and totally stands out from everything else that's going on. Spider-Man is also unbelievably well done and Tom Holland is just fantastic. I am one of the few people who actually loved The Amazing Spider Man movies, and really got mad to hear that they are going to reboot the character again but I can see now that it was worth it. The visuals are great from beginning to end, the music is also good as usual. The villain is something that most people though it was the weakest point but I strongly disagree with that. He had reasoning as to why he is doing those things, and he pushes the other characters in new directions which is also necessary. I generally adored this movie, and even though I am a DC fan, there's just no denying that Marvel knows what they're doing and that is why they are much more successful right now.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

","""Captain America: Civil War"" is the third biggest commerical success movie-wise from 2016 and of course this was a new installment to the Marvel Avengers franchise. The title here makes it sound like a Captain American film and while he probably does have more screen time and more significance than pretty much all the other characters, he is not at the very center of it all as much as you could think from the title. But first things first: The directors are brothers Anthony and Joe Russo and they are Emmy winners just like their writers here Chris Markus and Stephen McFeely with whom they collaborated on other occasions too, also on a previous Captain America movie. But back to this one here. With the exception of Hulk and Thor, you have all the Avengers in here basically, some very brief only, but others with more screen time. And Spider Man joins the gang too.

Even if you didn't grow up reading comic books, you will geek out every step of the way. This film is every bit as fun as 2012's ""The Avengers."" One of the many brilliant things that Marvel's Kevin Feige and his creative team and writers and directors did is that they already mapped out Marvel Cinematic Universe, they already know what A through Z will be and how to connect the dots in between. And so when Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) shows the Avengers the disastrous consequences of their saving-the-world efforts, we the audience feel the impact as well because we remember those individual movies which lead up to this installment, they're still fresh in our memories.

","Marvel Studios have done it yet again. Just when they appeared to be running out of steam after Age of Ultron and Ant-Man sat comfortably in the middle of the MCU canon, they strike back with this enormously entertaining series-booster. Essentially Avengers 2.5, this movie is crowded with so many well-known characters it's a miracle it's a movie at all, let alone a coherent and consistently exhilarating one. When the end credits roll there's disappointment rather than relief, unlike other recent superhero vs superhero efforts. The plot mechanics don't completely hold up under scrutiny ‚Äì especially the antagonist's scheme ‚Äì but it is the pitch-perfect character interaction that propels the story in between the multitude of kick-arse action sequences. And what kick-arse action sequences they are! Bookended with an impressively gritty Bourne-esque set piece and a seriously personal (and intense) punch up, each battle is cleverly given it's own spin to avoid feeling repetitive. Nothing tops the truly remarkable showdown amongst superhero friends though; with everyone fighting everyone, a web-slinging newbie stealing the show and a HUGE surprise, it confidently challenges the New York alien beat-down for MCU's greatest set piece. It doesn't quite reach Guardians levels of humour but there's a wonderful levity maintained throughout and the quip-filled dialogue is often laugh-out-loud funny, strongly aided by the rock-solid cast (both familiar and new). Picking a standout amongst such an electrifyingly diverse group of players is impossible; series regulars ‚Äì Cap (Evans), Iron Man (RDJ), Black Widow (ScarJo), et al ‚Äì are always excellent, whilst newcomers Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) are both downright awesome.

","Walt Disney Studios should have changed the title from ""Captain America: Civil War"" to ""Captain America: Stalemate"" since none of the heroes who square off against each other die. Co-directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, who helmed ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"" have the two rival divisions, led by Captain America and Iron Man, knocking the shenanigans out of each other in this contrived, drawn-out, 147 minute epic. Nevertheless, the worst thing that happens is War Machine loses control of his Iron Man style armored suit and makes a crash landing in a field. Although he suffers spinal damage, Lieutenant James Rhodes is back up and walking around with some difficulty before fade0ut. Mind you, ""Captain America: Civil War"" amounts to a letdown when nobody puts anybody down permanently. Ultimately, the two fractions emerge evenly matched. Nobody like S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Phil Coulson is around to die and make an impact like in ""Marvel's ""The Avengers"" (2012). At least the recent DC Comics movie ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" pretended to kill off one of the two title characters. Of course, anybody with a grain of sense knows that the adversary that perished in ""Batman v Superman"" isn't dead. Furthermore, the DC Comics extravaganza at least staged a funeral and the characters engaged in a period of mourning. Although the premise that Captain America and Iron Man would clash is certainly attention-grabbing, the movie pulls its punches because the superheroes emerge with little more than either bruises on themselves or scratches on their respective outfits.

","While watching Civil War, I couldn't help but think of DC / Warner Bros.'s desperate failures to catch up with Marvel's unstoppable success, specifically the recent disaster Batman v. Superman. Both films are about allies finding themselves on opposing sides, only Marvel actually succeeds on every level DC fails. Where BvS botched everything from the basic setup (why are these guys so angry with each other?) to nearly everything else that followed, Civil War soars with nuanced clarity: allegiances will fall / form, friendships will break / build, and summer entertainment will be had. Civil War finds tentpole-heroes Captain America and Iron Man at odds, each coming to grips with their power and position on the global scale on starkly different sides. Neither side is clearly right-or-wrong. Instead, we are presented with a familiar world, in which ""good-and-evil"" are not black-and-white, but largely grey. Even the de facto villain, one of the better in the MCU, finds sympathy through his heartbreaking and understandable motivations. These disparate sides are each so nuanced and logical, I found my loyalty swinging back-and-forth like Peter Parker at an air show. Speaking of which, Holland's turn as the webbed-crusader is easily the greatest in cinema: young, witty, wiry, and wide-eyed. Our first view of him is a standout, even while placed within the larger context of the marquee ""airport battle"", maybe the greatest superhero melee ever. The Russos, who have taken Whedon's place as go-to directors for Marvel, have such a strong control of humor, story, character, and action, they've even managed to better their fantastic Winter Soldier here.

61,6 May 2016,Thekeybaldemasterrises,9," Civil War was about a family being torn apart, and this movie gives you that, AMAZING
","Let's make it clear here that I'm not biased with either Marvel or DC, I enjoy both and I gave Batman v Superman the benefit of the doubt. You can read more of my thoughts on my review of the film. I'm a huge fan of DC and felt that the movie suffered many problems with it's story and character development. That's where Marvel has the upper hand for many years now, by setting up all these movies and stories we get well developed and likable characters that we already identify with. Once you get to a movie like Civil War, you've laid out the groundwork for an epic movie. Sure Marvel doesn't follow their story lines exactly like the comic but it approaches it in a very respectful way. The thing that always stuck out to me about Civil War in the comics was how personal the fight felt. The characters were all part of a team and were like a family, they loved each other and cared about one another. It felt like a realistic take on what really happens when you argue with the people you love, you see things one way, but they see it differently, and you both struggle to find a middle ground. This element I was pleased to see made it into the film, the motivations were different than the comic but the intentions still felt the same to me. We've seen the Avengers grow together as a team and as a family, but now we see them forced into this situation nobody wants to be in. These characters that were friends, partners, brothers, get torn apart by different circumstances, and you really feel the weight of it all. Especially between Tony and Steve, the Russo's have talked about betrayal being a theme in the film and I can see what they mean, Tony and Steve have such great dynamic in it all I'd hate to give away what draws the line between them but it sank my heart into my stomach to see their friendship being shredded to pieces. The Russo brothers did a spectacular job with the Winter Soldier and this film is no exception. The action was just phenomenal, every set piece was timed right, and the story didn't drag by any means. One of the strong points of the Russo's that me and a friend of mine agreed on was the fact that they have a good understanding of character arc, they added so many new characters in this movie, and they were used perfectly, each one had a shining moment. Black Panther and Spider-Man rocked it the most in my opinion, both are just a hoot to watch and I can't wait to see them star in their own solo films. I think many people were disappointed with Age of Ultron because it didn't really feel like anything new, or improve on what we've seen before, it was the first Avengers just a little bigger. This movie is what Age of Ultron should have been, emotional, conflicting, and epic in it's own way. I was worried this movie would be black and white, making Tony the antagonist and Steve the ""good guy"". I felt conflicted and didn't know who to side with, and you know the movie's done it's job when you don't even know who's right, and who's wrong. A 10/10 for me, and easily one of the best Marvel movies to date. I've only given Marvel a 10/10 for the first Iron Man, the first Avengers, The Winter Soldier, and Guardians. If you love their films, this one you'll easily love. Great way to start the summer and a perfect way to kick off phase 3!",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

The problem is that the story is so shallow as to render it almost nonexistent.

Would be like the Lone Ranger fighting Tonto over politics. Who cares? The formula just does not work. Plus, the movie has a lot of silly dialog, which provoked unintended laughter. There is little attempt at character development. Soon it becomes apparent that there are no good guys or bad guys, just a bunch of guys flexing their high-tech muscles. The use of flashbacks just adds to the confusion. The Spiderman character is incredibly mushy, even for a comic book story. The only character that has some depth is Iron Man, played by Robert Downey Jr. It seems that much of the plot centers around him. But he does not carry the story. The movie failed to engage the audience's attention. Even a story based on comic book characters has to have some dramatic content. Otherwise, as in the case of this movie, the entire story becomes stagy, shallow and noisy. Noise is no substitute for drama. The audience wants characters they can care about, not laugh at. Listen Hollywood: people want heroes, not laughing stocks. Have Captain America fighting Nazis, not his friends. Have Tony Stark save people in distress. Have the beautiful Black Widow show the world that she is great. Have these super heroes do superb things that win them real acclaim.

","By far, this is the widest, deepest, most-detailed, and best- choreographed of marvel movies. In this movie, marvel distinctly send message that superhero genre is not on the fringe of degradation. It erase all the cynical and doubts feeling from people. Of course if we seek for the realism action, there are no such thing in superhero genre. In my opinion, a superhero genre needs to be rated in different perspective than a normal action film. Thats also happens for CGI. Still, civil war (which solely captain America franchise, not avengers or bigger context) is complete as a film. It consist of well-directed storytelling, good character performance (especially Downey), good jokes, and very good choreography (especially airport scene).

91,14 April 2016,AfterBuzz,," a wonderful character study to go along with the BEST action I've ever seen!
","At the start, the film finds Captain America yet again adjusting to working under the increasingly morally ambiguous ways of the new Avengers structure. The set up is masterfully done. This is the fifth time we've seen the character and it's remarkable how complex and how much depth has been layered on to developing this icon. The Avengers film touched a bit with his feelings of what it was like to be in the modern era, and Winter Soldier drove the point home. Following that classic sequel, Civil War is a wonderful character study to go along with a purely thrilling plot. This was exactly the perfect vehicle to deliver a film to advance the character of Captain America but also give Tony Stark a perfect finishing arc and more development himself. What makes BOTH Steve and Tony interesting aren't their abilities or weapons but the men themselves. Steve's moral code and ""man out of time"" elements are tested in this film but not in a way anyone saw coming. The viewer that normally would trust that Cap is doing what's right can look at his actions in a different light. He is still coming to terms with a past that is long gone and he is still longing for a better more decent era. Putting Bucky back in the mix clouds his judgment. Dealing with the shades of grey of the modern era and being part of any controlling organization after the events of the Winter Soldier movie has changed him. It's exactly like all the epic events and decisions Tony Stark has made over five films has changed the character of Iron Man. The resulting conflict between the two is as epic as can be.

","Marvel/Disney is a monstrous force in the film business with their superhero movies. They have set the bar so incredibly high that you almost can not compare these movies to other films because they simply trump the competition unless it is of their own brand. With that being said, 'Captain America: Civil War' met my predictions perfectly. I absolutely loved this film. Never before have we seen a superhero movie where so many of our beloved character are not only in the movie, they are fighting each other in all their super- powered glory and for longer than 5 minutes (Yes, I am looking at you BvS). The introduction of new faces were fantastic and even beyond the much anticipated arrival of Spider-man. Black Panther, Spider-man, Ant-Man, Scarlet Witch; all of their screen time felt natural and needed for the movie, as well as the returning faces we all know and love. The villain behind the scenes was great. All of his/her actions were methodical and evil and it was almost as if he was the puppeteer beyond the true Civil War going on. Beyond the plethora of pros this film had for me, I do have simply one comment for the cons. The humor did seem too much at times. Although hilarious at every moment, there were times where they could have done without it and simply let the action carry the movie on its own. Regardless, as I spoke of before... While most can critique this movie, when you put it up against other Marvel movies, it can be easy to say what was better or what was worse but when it comes down to Marvel vs. other typical movies: Marvel wins each time. 'Captain America: Civil War' will not disappoint. It is a movie for all viewers and of all ages. This is a must-see movie for 2016.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

","It's that time of the year again when the theaters flood with the mega-budget summer blockbusters that scale the mountain at the box office, and Marvel superhero flicks are no strangers to this. After the successful but disappointment of DC's 'Batman Vs Superman' early this spring, many fans were hoping to see a comeback in the superhero genre, this third installment of the highly successful Captain America franchise pays off not only defying expectations but even improving upon its predecessor. With Joe and Anthony Russo turning to the directors' chairs, this superhero action flick sees Chris Evans reprising the role of the titular character along with Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Anthony Mackie as Falcon, Don Cheadle as War Machine, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, Elizabeth Olson as Scarlet Witch, and Paul Bettany as Vision. Taking the place after the events of 'The Avengers: Age of Ultron', the team has fallen under massive political scrutiny by the government for all the damage resulted in their battles against the threats. In response, the government passes a bill that puts limits on the superheroes actions requiring them to work under government surveillance. Tony Stark (Iron Man) and the team agree with bill and sign it, Steve Rogers (Captain America) in the other hand disapproves of it and chooses to go outside the law. When Steve Rogers refuses to turn in Bucky Barnes (played by Sebastian Stan) who is wanted by the government, this leads an all-out conflict between the team.

But this might be my favorite Marvel movie yet. So many characters are in it, yet I felt like every one of them got at least one memorable moment, even lame ol' Hawkeye! At the end of Act 2, there's a 20-minute battle scene that involves a dozen super-heroes, and it's amazing, probably the best of this genre. I went in rooting 100% for Cap, but by the end, I was feeling really badly for Iron Man and kinda wanted to see him kick Steve Rogers' butt. We get a couple of new heroes ‚Äì Spider-Man and the Black Panther ‚Äì and they are both just about perfect translations from comic book to film. This Brit they have playing Peter Parker is probably my favorite Spidey yet, even though he's only on screen for maybe 15 minutes. He's exactly as Spidey should be: a nervous kid who handles his anxiety by being a nonstop motormouth during his battles. And the Panther is just so cool. Ant-Man plays a big part in that huge battle I mentioned, getting some of the best moments during the fight. But really, this movie is Cap's, Bucky's, and Tony's story. What helps make it so great is how Marvel has built up their saga over multiple movies ‚Äì we're already familiar with and invested in these characters.

Well, Captain America is so good as gone now, but his biggest group of enemies is still not defeated. This is probably his last movie in the Captain America series, so in my opinion it should have happened in this movie. On the other hand it's better with the knowledge of now.

117,19 September 2016,ianquiksilver,1," Worst Marvel movie so far!
","Terribly weak Marvel movie. Compared to the comic, this is a joke. In the comic it was an episode of epic proportions. Anyone who hasn't read it should go straight to their closest comic book store. First off, timing was bad in its release, it came after Batman vs Superman which was the first of the two movies to address the question of super-hero liability so as such it didn't break any new ground. In the Civil war movie, the reason for the split within the super heroes isn't a very strong one or even evident, and they're too ""soft"" in how the two factions are opposed. At the same time its badly superimposed on the actual events as they unfold, in this case Baron Zemo's deceit. Zemo in the movie is again, a sad representation of Baron Zemo from the comic. In the movie he's just a civilian, ex-Sokovian special forces agent, who didn't have an issue with superheroes until his family became innocent by-standers. The worst part is that when he explains this to them, he says something to the effect of ""I have been planning this for so long, for 1 whole year I have been studying you"" .. Just one year?! Oh you poor poor soul, of course you should be allowed ""vengeance"" on something that wasn't intentional, and it just ignores the whole ""Would you prefer your family alive, but having the world run by Ultron?"" or ""Could you consider it a needed sacrifice for the good of the humanity?"" dilemma, oh but no, this guy wants it all, bad guys destroyed without any fallout. His character would have been better if he wasn't supposed to be Zemo, but just some random ex-Hydra operative. The intro builds up to a joke of a pulled-punches fight between themselves at an airport, where they're obviously not trying to fight but actually avoiding fighting each other building up to that all dramatic moment when they suddenly realize that some may have to stay behind, well except for Cap and Winterboy. And then they fly off to Siberia to neutralize each other, amazing ... The only one good way to finish this would have been if the other winter-soldiers had been reanimated and an epic fight unfolded, with some actual form of Cornelian Dilemma, after which both factions could have decided to part ways and each go in their ""for"" or ""against"" (superhero registration) camps. The only new element this movie brought was T'Challa, but again, his presence was weak along with his reason for being on the ""pro registration"" side. There were too few superheroes, a weak plot and badly orchestrated sequence of events which only served to showcase Stark's uber sense of ego-centrism and inability to see past his codpiece. Spiderman's portrayal and presence was also far from good. He does play a integral part in the comic which is why he ""had"" to be added to the mix here, but in the comic where he initially wants out and finally joins Stark's side reluctantly, in addition to being full grown, in the movie he's still a teenager and just is part of their team, without having to think of the issue at hand, and as quickly as he was added, he is then just as easily dismissed (feeling like the director justifying putting a tick next to ""have Spiderboy be part of big fight - done""). In the comic he eventually even turns against Stark when he discovers just how bad things really are. So many things in this movie are dramatically weak in nature. Take Vision's participation, here's a superhero with tremendous potential, yet he is just a side character in the narrative of the movie, mainly serving to keep Wanda ""imprisoned"" on the simple basis that he wants ""people not to be afraid of her anymore"", this coming from a red faced robot who can dephase at will. He does serve to almost block access to the Quinjet by eye-lasering the tower to fall on its hangar, something Ironman could just as easily have done himself, but why he aims for the tower instead of just frying the Quinjet there is no explanation for. The prison plays a much more important role in the comic, especially as its in the Negative-zone, an alien universe requiring portals to travel to and from, not some uber-submarine.

","Marvel sure has things figured out (which is a statement likely made in recent years by many a Movie Fan ‚Äì and the folks at DC ‚Äì with a few expletives thrown in for emphasis)! If there were any lingering doubt, it has certainly been erased by ""Captain America: Civil War"" (PG-13, 2:26). While the DC Extended Universe has had moderate success with their early films featuring and bringing together their stable of comic book characters, the Marvel Cinematic Universe began Phase Three of its grand plan with ""Civil War"" (the 13th MCU movie) and is making money almost faster than the government can print it. While the first two ""Avengers"" movies sit comfortably in the top 10 on the list of all-time box office champs worldwide, DC's ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice"" doesn't even make the top 40. ""Civil War"" made over $250 million worldwide before its first full day in U.S. theaters ‚Äì and even before opening in huge countries like China and India! The film's opening week receipts in several countries is second all-time only to ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"", and its trailer is second only to ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" in online views. But¬Ö does this Captain America film deserve such attention and success? ""Captain America: Civil War"" is the third (and planned to be the final) Captain America feature, but also feels a lot like a third Avenger's movie, with its many characters ‚Äì and its plot, which continues story lines from the most recent installment of each of those film series. This film picks up about a year after the Avengers defeated a populicidal sentient computer program which Tony Stark accidentally unleashed in ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"". Captain America / Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) are in Lagos, Nigeria trying to stop Brock Rumlow (Frank Grillo) from stealing and making off with a dangerous biological weapon.

The fight scenes and choreography are tight and extremely well done, and while they do lose a little edge do to some fast editing, I won't knock how exhilarating certain scenes are throughout the film. They took big leaps with this movie and it sure paid off. And I'm very much taking into account that I just saw the movie, and I'm still dealing with the rush of anxiety that came with almost not getting in.

After reading the third book, it is heartache in two words. Why is the heartache?
The fight between the American team, the winter soldier and the Iron Man, of course: the captain wanted to protect the winter soldier, Tony wanted revenge for killing his parents, and Tony was angry because the captain knew about it and didn't tell himself.

Marvel has a separate movie for each superhero then they made Avengers to bring all superheroes together and Civil War follows same idea. Too many superheroes, 2 teams and their face off. Wow sounds great no? Movie starts with kick ass action sequence. Keeps you hooked for first 30 minutes then some necessary scenes to set a plot which gives you loo break. Then after Interval movie is bit of slow but then last 40 minutes are brilliant. Spidey's entry and his presence made it more entertaining. End is quite Emotional (not actually) and bit disappointing or exciting, depends on your choice how you take it. Film wins your heart by its special effects and those scenes are eye pleasing in 3D. Screenplay could have been better but it is not bad either, usually this kind of films are not made to entertain you for complete 150 minutes and you know it. Runtime looks 10 stretched.

","Earth's Mightiest Heroes has return to duke it out with Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) or Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) in a battle for vigilance & superiority under the increasing political issue of government oversight. Directed by the Russo Brothers, Civil War marks the 13th overall film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and the first film of the MCU's Phase 3. It is based on the Civil War limited series, albeit on a much smaller scale. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, the Civil War conflict in the comic book was a lot more intense, than it was, in the film. After all, it dealt with unmasking, secret identities, and high death tolls. However, since secret identities don't really existed in the film series, the conflict was change, significant with Rogers trying to protect his buddy, Winter Soldier/Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) from standing trial in a federal court. While, this marks a major point of divergence from the original comics, the film still somewhat deals with the conflict between freedom and security; and the fact that these super-powered individuals have to act under official regulation, somewhat akin to law enforcement with this plot device. In my opinion, I felt like the issues with the Sokovia Accords could have easily be solve, if simple-minded, Rogers, would just agree to it, and then, ask for a fair trial for his buddy. Yes, I get that Rogers might be, against government oversight, because of the events of 2014's 'Captain America: Winter Soldier"" and Stark is for more security after the killing spree in 2015's 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'; but there was no reason, for these two, to really hate and disagree with each other. After all, both of those events from the previous films, effect both of the character in similar equally ways. If any, they should agree with each other. The rift formed between the Avengers due to their differing opinions on the Sokovia Accords stays civil only until Helmut Zemo (Daniel Br√ºhl) made it personal for both sides' leaders: By implicating Bucky in two international incidents, he tested Cap's loyalty to the team while forcing Tony to act on the Accords. He's by far, the best Marvel villain, these films had in a long time. Zemo actually manages to drive the Avengers apart, which is something his comic counterpart never achieved. He wasn't cartoony. He was a very compelling character. Br√ºhl is wonderful in the role, despite his character actual scheme relies on a few too many coincidences, destroying the Winter Soldiers plot and also the fact that a video existed, when there is no way, it should or Tony not knowing about it. He did better, than the other villain, Crossbones/Brock Rumlow (Frank Grillo). Crossbones was a little disappointing with his short appearance, since he had a major part in the comic. Another big change, from the comic book to the film, was Captain America's fate. While, many people might disagree with me, but I found the fact that he doesn't die; somewhat of a blessing in disguise, because I never like that comic book arch. Although, he lives in this version, at least, the movie does give depth, with other emotional deaths, and one shocking big twist ending, toward the film. It gave this movie, some real-world value, without going too grim or violent, like 2015's 'Batman Vs Superman: Dawn of Justice'. Though this movie is significantly less dark than that DC Comic's mess of a movie, it does warrant caution for children, especially under the age of 13. Despite that, this movie is still pure escapism. Everybody in the film did their job, and it was well-acted. While, the humor is bit unbalance. There's still some laughs. The action scenes were amazing. However, it was a bit jarring to some of the reasons, why the other supporting characters were there. A good example is why Ant-Man/Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) was even in the film? Why would he risk, going back to prison and being away from his daughter? At least, Hawkeye/Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner)'s reason for returning is pretty clear, because the fact that Scarlet Witch/Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen)'s brother save him, in the previous film. Another is Spiderman/Peter Parker (Tom Holland). Since, he wasn't unmasking, there was really no reason for him to be there, besides fan-service & cross-company partnership. As much as I love the character, I kinda sick of him, being rebooted, time and time ago. While, it's cool that characters who had only minor roles in the original comic book event like Black Panther/T'Calla (Chadwick Boseman), Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), Falcon/Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), War Machine/James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) & Vision (Paul Bettany) have bigger roles and some time spent on them in this film, but nevertheless, it takes away scenes for characters like Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp) to rise. While, she did receives a slightly larger role since the last movie, Sharon is still very underdeveloped as a character, considering her level of prominence in Cap's supporting cast in the comics. Anyways, with so many characters jam packed into one movie, it hard to keep track of all of them. The overall story of this film often relay on continuities from the previous films. It's doesn't stand on its own. After all, it's seem for any general or new viewer to these films, you would have to see, a good deal of the previous films, before even attempting to see this film. Not only that, but you might have to read the original Civil War comic book by writer Mark Millar to further get insight on what is happening, as well, as other graphic novels. It's a lot of homework. Also, this movie has pacing problems. Clocking in at 146 minutes. It's a long sit. However, once you aboard or caught up; you better, buckle in, because it will be, one hell of a ride! Worth the watch!",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

","CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR is another Marvel Cinematic Universe flick that sees the series going from strength to strength; this is better than the last two CAPTAIN AMERICA films and on par with the highs of THE AVENGERS. The plot speaks for itself and takes things to an enjoyable political level as Iron Man and Captain America find themselves on opposing sides of the law. Despite a massive running time, this is a fast-paced and hugely enjoyable production, with a large cast featuring all manner of new superhero faces (Ant Man, Black Panther, and Spider-Man all make their appearances here). The film's high point is undoubtedly the action choreography, which mixes wire work, seamless CGI, and expert fight choreography into a satisfying whole. The opening sequence with Frank Grillo's returning bad guy gets things off to a fantastic start and is only bettered by the incredible airport fight later on. All of the usual faces here and are either given a lot or a little to work with, and there's the right balance of humour and excitement, thrills and fun.

","I remember in 2002 when I saw, at the time, a DVD of the Spider-Man on display at a DVD rental store, the first one with Tobey Maguire. I looked at it and decided not to get it, because I thought that there were already too many super heroes' movies. But, eventually, the movie found myself couple of years later, and when I watched it, I took my thought back, because of the brilliant script of the movie, which would keep the same strength in the two Spider-Man movies that followed it. Then it came the new Batman in Batman Begins in 2005, which was also superb and that also brought legendary sequels. The same can be said about the Iron Man films. Those movies where not only about the action: there was emotion and plenty of it, romance, life, creativity, intelligent crime plots and many other qualities. The narration on the first Spider-Man says beautifully that ""this, like any story worth telling, is all about a girl"" - simply superb, something that was totally lost through the years, because suddenly, it all became to crumble. When the first Spider-Man came out without the original actors, I watched, and it was like watching a two-hour action sequence with no spirit; it was just the action. Then other superhero movies started to come out in the same note: just action; emotionless action. Then the superhero leagues movies came, and together they couldn't bring a single tear to an eye anymore. So they made them fight against each other now. And today, I wasn't even gone through an hour of this film, Captain America: Civil War, and I was already tired of so many action sequences under a shallow, only elaborated, story with no emotion whatsoever; robotic action with no feeling or spirit. Even the actors seemed to be acting mechanically, maybe because even they are tired of it. The story breathed a little after an hour and the part where Stark recruits young Spider-man is the best scene of the movie in my opinion. The part where they all fight against each other is not completely bad either. However, it wasn't enough to save the movie; it only made it bearable and a little more entertaining. Well, now I guess I can really say that there are today too many superheroes movies, and sadly, not because of how many they are, but because of how poor they've become. The theme in superhero movies nowadays circles only about the conflict in whether superheroes are for our protection or a threat, heroes or villains. Seriously, after this one, I don't think I'll be watching another superhero movie until another one stumbles at me and turns out to be worth watching.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

","So we have captain America 3 is a avengers in disguise minus Thor and hulk that would drop any film down from ten to 8.5 but we have fine comic and action paring in the new incarnation of spider man and a new character of black panther to bring the film up 2to 10:out of ten. this film improves on Ultron even though that was a marvelous film but this is a lean and busy smart story which is also very strong indeed the jokes are left to the new characters as the main story is brilliant so no need for them here as it's a civil war as captain America played by ever evolving Chris Evans he is the spiritual leader of the avengers but he jealousy of iron man tony stark who buys everything. so he is being undermined by him so with that out of the way we have a James bond style opening where we have captain America the black widow falcon and a drone chasing targets in Lagos so with hydra trying for wmd and there bad on the loose causing issues for the team chasing these targets a mishandle effort causing collateral damage the UN and world leaders want to reign in the superheroes only do dived the team in two iron man, black widow war machine on one side of the accord then on the other other captain America Scarlett witch hawkeye falcon and the vison and ant man and the newbies introduced get some of the comic relief in between the action to cause a stir but as captain America thinks he being boxed in and no freedom Tensions start to flare and to make he is emotional due to a loss of a figure head in the founding of shield. and things get worse, in that the Captain's old friend Bucky Barnes aka The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) appears his mind gets altered like he hypnotized so he lining up another high profile assassination. The ensuing chaos quickly drags the rest of The Avengers into the mix as everyone starts to take sides in a fight no one wants to be having. Both characters make a big impact both in their introductions and their roles in the plot as it unfolds. The story itself also makes some clever twists and turns along the way. Just when I thought things were getting predictable and eye-rolling cheesy it all changed and created a new dynamic of for the characters involved. Fight scenes are scattered throughout and serve to dazzle and amaze with a surprising amount of humour thrown in along the way. So with winter solder being captain America old alley his background has changed his mind alters like a switch and captain America side with him causing a few twist in this film takes his vengeance out causing captain America to save his friend ultimately leading a 2 on 1 situation causing no end of harm a and also a old figure head in captain America life gone changes his belief and alters his taught process. and old fashioned car chase ensues with the with the having his own agenda black panther chases the winter solder and captain to fight it out during the chase with the law not far behind. after this a past haunts and hurts iron man down to his guilt and that cause grief so much that he takes his vengeance out causing captain America to split the team as hydra suicide bombing in Europe and so with law enforcements chasing around trying to bring justice reign in the collateral damage and when the sides come together to get there points across to look for a peacefull resolution, as we get the civil war choosing who side is who on but there's a pivitol moment in the film when the side realize that 2 against one who will stand and fight for a friend or who will fall and die trying or will the political motivations get the interfere. with Marvel films in 2016 is that this is now the 13th film in their current ongoing cinematic universe. Your enjoyment of any of the Avengers films or this Captain America film will largely be affected by how many of the previous films you have seen and paid attention to. The character development is great but it takes place over a number of films and isn't suited to anyone looking to drop in for a quick superhero flick. With this being the last ""main"" story film before the third Avengers movie in 2018, a lot of things are left open. Not everyone gets to live happily ever after, and that's a good thing, but with two films every year Marvel movies are going from strength to strength .

The central political conflict was given a lot of weight and significance. The first half of it was simply brilliant, very reminiscent of The Dark Knight. Then some flaws started showing up in its second half. One of the things I've gotten so tired of with Marvel is the insistence of pretty much every film of theirs to be bogged down with comedy. That's something that I appreciated about the previous two Captain America films, even if only the 2nd one was good. Here, I never felt like humor started appearing... until the build-up and the first battle scene between the Avengers in the airport. All of a sudden, all of them started giving funny one-liners and sarcastic quips. Were the lines bad? Not at all, but with everything else going on, and considering they were now in a physical battle with their own friends, it just felt like a complete betrayal to the tone and the heft of the whole thing. I loved Holland as Spiderman, but an article that is floating online said is best- he was great in it and it excites me for his own films, but he had no business being in this film or being introduced at all. He and Ant-man, among a few others, just lighten the whole thing up at the exact moment when it should have gotten even more serious. Luckily, the film goes back on track after this battle scene.

When the Avengers cause another international incident, most of the governments of the world, think they should be held accountable for their actions.

","Captain America: The Winter Solider pitted the titular protagonist against an organisation bigger then himself, all whilst battling his own demons, particularly his best friend-turned assassin, Bucky. Civil War at its core follows this narrative, exploring the relationship between these two characters even further. After numerous, wide-scaled and deadly incidents, the US Government, and now Secretary of State, 'Thunderbolt' Ross introduces the Sokovia Accord-which aims to prevent the heroes from acing freely but rather work in accordance to rules and regulations of the Untied Nations. In this regard, Civil War retains the political driven narrative and themes of The Winter Solider, but makes it more personal. The characters have different viewpoints and conflicting ideologies, causing them to split apart and form their own sides. Tony Stark for example feels guilty after a confrontation with a mother leads to him realising the cost of his actions; helping him realise that he shouldn't be allowed to act on his free will. Steve Rodgers believes ""that the safest hands are still our own"" and refuses to sign his name and adhere to the Sokovia Accords. The film perfectly sets up their conflicting beliefs, providing depth to the reasons they fight.

Steve understands that, but also doesn't want to be under full control of the government. They both have a very good point and their actions are always understandable, reasonable and human. Plus, this movie gave us the first Spider-Man and Black Panther appearance. The fight scenes were so well choreographed and edited, I loved it. Zemo was a great villain in this film, one of the best villains of the whole MCU. Simply because he was able to do so much damage, even without being a villain who has crazy powers.

It's much of a clash between ideologies which was really interesting to see. I also have to talk about how Spiderman was portrayed in this movie. I really liked him. As expected he was not the focus of the movie. However, he was not just a cameo either. The few scenes he was in the movie was enough to like him. If i have to point out flaws there is hardly any. Marvel is almost perfect. Almost. I do have one problem with the movie. It was the main villain. Like other marvel villain, this villain just didn't work for me. The movie would have done fine even without the villain. It feels like he was just there because ...he was just there!. But it's not a deal breaker people!! The story isn't about the villain. It's about Civil War. And you're gonna get it.. I can't recommend this movie enough. Believe me guys, the 1 star reviews are all from Marvel haters.

Marvel fans, however, would be disappointed as the crux that led to the divergence of the Avengers ‚Äì the Superhuman Registration Act ‚Äì did not even appear in the entire movie. The building-up of the tension was flimsy; Captain America's tie and loyalty to Bucky was unexplained, the reasons for recruits joining Cap's team were unclear (why would Hawkeye give up his domestic bliss to fight as an outlaw? How did they get Ant-man to join their cause?) and it appeared as if the whole point was to have two resultant teams with balanced numbers. Vision seemed somewhat weak ‚Äì yes fans would know his attraction to the Scarlet Witch later ‚Äì but wasn't it a little early to have him reduced to total putty whenever Wanda was involved? Black Widow did not appear to be the kind who would submit to supervision, and instead of outlining her inner struggle which ended up in her letting Cap and Bucky board the plane, now it was as Iron Man described ‚Äì she acted like a ""double spy"" with no reason whatsoever.

","Eight years into Marvel Studios' multi-property film franchise and its increasingly convoluted continuity, a movie as good as ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016) is truly and delightfully surprising. While I doubt it could stand alone, and is guilty of a few shoe- horned cameos and more than a few plot contrivances, the second instalment from Joe and Anthony Russo (directors of the previous and similarly impressive Captain America: The Winter Solider {2014}) is a success. As an action spectacle it is above par; as a springboard for future franchise films it is reinvigorating; and as a meditation on the problem of superheroes' power and sovereignty it is the best since Zack Snyder's ""Watchmen"" (2009). We are not likely to see critical reception that puts it in league with Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" (2008), rather condescendingly hailed by non- superhero fans as something ""more than a comic book movie"" (Roger Ebert). But ""Civil War"" is every bit as engaged with themes of authority and morality as Nolan's seminal work, and borrows much credence from the Marvel Cinematic Universe's well-established lore and cast of characters. It is as close to the true, transcendent experience of comic book fandom as we have yet to see on the big screen.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

However, due to the maligned nature of Loki's sceptre, the Age of Ultron wreaked havoc on Sokovia, while the Avengers scrambled to prevent collateral damage as the city was raised to the skies and yet, not everyone could be saved. Nations become suspicious of the unchecked powers of Earth's mightiest heroes and those who lost their families due to their actions, seek to avenge them. Thus, 'Civil War' is partly an aftermath of 'Age of Ultron' and partly a follow-up to 'Captain America: Winter Soldier' mainly due to Bucky's presence.

","As a comic book fan, reading Civil War was awesome. I am not a purist, I don't believe that they should be exactly like they are in the comic books. That being said, Civil War the comic had a great deal of characters and story. I was worried on how they can could do the movie with losing the great story telling of the actual civil war. While the movie was not really like the comic book story, they still managed to make a great Civil War Movie. And they kept the strong points, action and some of the main characters like Spider- man, Iron man and Captain America all in good form. The action was excellent, copying that same gritty, back and forth special forces fighting that they managed to bring to life in Winter Soldier. Team up scenes, unexpected powers and just coolness of their abilities soared throughout the screen with so many different awe factors. The story it self is believable, they make it a pretty decent reason why one hero would choose this side and the other would choose the other. And other characters that would be in turmoil no matter what they chose. To me when a movie is 3 hours and it seems like 30 minutes, you have a good flick. There was so much to like about it. The humor, was well timed and just flat out great. I heard a lot of people saying Black Panter and Spiderman where awesome, but Paul Rudd as Ant Man was amazing too.

273,5 October 2022,TheHonestCritic,8," A worthy conclusion to the ""Captain America"" trilogy?
","""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016), a lot of you know this already. But, if you don't, ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" (2014) is my personal favorite Marvel film, as well as one of my top ten all-time favorite movies in general. So, you can imagine the high expectations I had when I waited for ""Captain America: Civil War"" to be released in theaters! Right? My hype was overwhelming, I couldn't wait for it to come out. Well, the day finally came for it's theatrical release. I went to go see it, and I really enjoyed it thoroughly! But then, when I eventually watched it on DVD, it just didn't have the same impact. I just felt a bit underwhelmed when I saw it again. Don't get me wrong, it is still a very well-done film. However, it does have a few hiccups here and there. ""Captain America: Civil War"" has an average story, fantastic acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and of course a perfect soundtrack to tie it all together. The plot is, political involvement with the Avengers causes a feud between the heroes, which causes them to take opposing sides and turn against each other. Wow, now that's what I call an exciting premise! Overall, it does deliver on the storyline and it's everything that you expect to see. But, at the same time, that's also a problem here. Why? Because, this is supposed to be a solo ""Captain America"" movie. Yet, it feels like another ""Avengers"" film. To tell you the truth, I would've preferred this to be ""Avengers 2"", instead of the diarrhea stain known as ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015)! Which, in my opinion, is the absolute worst Marvel Cinematic Universe movie. Another lousy Marvel film that came out during this time, was ""Ant-Man"" (2015). What they should've done, was exclude ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" and also ""Ant-Man"" and go straight into ""Captain America: Civil War"". This should've been ""Avengers 2""! They could've still included Ultron in the movie, as one of his many powers is mind control. He could've influenced the world politicians to create the Sokovia Accords, as well as corrupt the Avengers' minds to turn them against each other. On top of that, Hank Pym would've created Ultron at some point instead of Tony Stark, which would've been comic book accurate. That would've been an outstanding film! Then, they could've just done the third ""Captain America"" movie later on about Bucky's brainwashing and Zemo's reign, minus the other Avengers and it would've made more sense. The whole sub-plot with the Sokovia Accords and the other characters is way too much going on for one film. Let alone, a solo ""Captain America"" movie! Plus, it almost fell into ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" territory with the amount of one-liners in this film. As I've mentioned, that's a common problem with most Marvel movies, the corny jokes and humor. But here, it's not that bad. However, some of them can get distracting! For example, right before the airport fight (which is one of the best scenes in this film), Black Widow says: ""this is gonna end well."" I know that's an odd thing to comment on about this movie, but every time I hear it, that line completely detracts me from the moment! Bottom line, there is way too much going on in this film and yet, they tried to squeeze it all in. That being said, there is a lot of focus on Captain America among the other characters. Also, this is probably the most sufficient way to express this substantial story. However, you would think they'd learn from the same mistakes of ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" (2016)! At least compared to that travesty, ""Captain America: Civil War"" is cohesive. One thing that really stands out, is the action and fight scenes. They were really well-done! Those scenes alone make this movie worth watching. Other than that, the best word to describe the storyline is, cluttered. As for the acting, it's standard to great from the whole entire cast. But once again, the most lackluster performances are from Don Cheadle as James Rhodes/War Machine and Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Both of them are just dull and boring to watch for the most part. I could scream! For example, Don Cheadle's facial expressions barely ever change, and his acting is just wooden. Then, Scarlett Johansson's acting is deadpan and boring. But, it isn't her worst performance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That would actually be in ""Avengers: Age of Ultron""! However, this performance is probably a close second though. On an unrelated note, I've seen other films where actors and actresses act the same way, and then they're nominated for Worst Actor or Worst Actress! How does Scarlett Johansson get a free pass? Also, how did Don Cheadle avoid that nomination? Other than their substandard performances, the rest of the cast does a great job! All of the sets/locations are perfect and they give this film a nice atmosphere. As for the special effects, they are all very well-done and still hold up to this day. Which is no surprise, seeing that it came out in 2016! Finally, the soundtrack composed by Henry Jackman is outstanding. His film score sets the perfect tone for the story and it really helps bring the movie to life! ""Captain America: Civil War"" is a fun film to watch once in a while. But, in the years that followed it has not aged that well. The storyline is the weakest element! However, as a whole, I still give it a pass. There are just enough good elements throughout the movie that make it worth a watch. I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 8 out of 10 IMDB stars. Unless you're just getting into the Marvel films, it's really hard for me to recommend it otherwise. That being said, if you're watching the Marvel Cinematic Universe in chronological order, I suggest skipping ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" and ""Ant-Man"". Seriously, you won't be missing a thing. I honestly recommend that you skip those films and go straight into this movie. Just make sure to refer to ""Captain America: Civil War"" as ""Avengers 2""!",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

","Yeah this film one of the best films ever and i do i can watch right describe and lost in this film got best this soon not repeat. The story of the film is okay take a deep breath and is scary and backed film all right is heavy and you absorption and you in to see the film could not move. Directing the film also all right is great and the overture magnetized. actors game okay normal and attractive body man will tremble as especially Tom Holland House. Music videos okay great and attractive. Im not gonna spoil one single thing, since this movie should be seen by only the two trailers you probably saw. Don't watch any TV spots after the second trailer or whatever! Im gonna touch a few aspects and rate them. Acting: Of course it's amazing. The characters we were waiting for were black panther and of course SPIDERMAN! Both were done amazing! Spiderman has a bigger role than I personally expected and it's done with grace. Love it. Black Panther was such a good character with great motivation why he's doing what he's doing. The acting per usual from the other characters were great! 10/10 Story: Now where another (let's leave it) unnamed superhero movie failed this year, and no I'm not talking about dead- pool.., was the story. Now this story is what I expected from the other unnamed superhero movie. I didn't know what side I wanted to be on; cap's or iron man's. I was so conflicted and even while they're fighting you don't know who to root for. The villain in this movie felt a bit, not really out of place, but unnecessary in my opinion. But Marvel always struggles to find a good fleshed out villain except for Loki & kingpin in the series. 10/10 Black Panther, Antman y Spiderman, they are just amazing and interesting characters in the film. Visual effects are amazing and the battles are really good. I thought that marvel will never do a very good movie like it was winter soldier, but i was wrong, i was totally wrong I don't like to compare, but i enjoy this film more than batman v superman. It's obviously that it is not perfect, that's sure but for me this is the best marvel movie, and i cant wait for the infinity war, the MCU is in good hands with the Russo brothers. You already know that this is one of the best Marvel movies to date. You already know that this movie has an all star cast. You already know that this movie has great directors.

There were parts in the last 2 Avengers movies that I just went to bathroom for because they were boring and felt unnecessary. Not a lot of boring filler, family, stuff here. Some. I wanted to see Wanda showcase her Scarlet Witch powers more, and did. The cameos are terrific. A lot of fun despite the severity of the tone.

","This is the best Marvel movie yet! Even if you're not a superhero fan, I still highly recommend this, because it doesn't feel like a superhero movie. Much like ""Winter Soldier"" it's more of a political thriller. It makes you think, and debate about accountability and other important issues, which is very unusual for a superhero film. It's not just mindless action. The action sequences, by the way, are some of the best I've seen in any superhero movie, Marvel or otherwise. They're choreographed so well. There's a lot that goes on, yet you never feel lost or overwhelmed during them. Up until this point, Andrew Garfield was my favorite actor to portray Spider-Man. Move over, Andrew Garfield. Newcomer Tom Holland has taken your spot. I was a bit skeptical when he showed up in the trailers because I thought he sounded way too young. But when he started throwing around one-liners in true Spider-Man fashion, all that doubt instantly went away. Fun fact: Tom Holland starred alongside Chris Hemsworth in ""In The Heart of the Sea,"" and it's because of Hemsworth's recommendation of Holland for the role of Spider-Man to Kevin Feige, the head of Marvel Studios that Holland was cast in the role. Great choice, Chris Hemsworth! I'm excited to see what this young man has in store for the future. This was everything I wanted, and more. Every time I think ""Marvel can't possibly top this,"" they prove me wrong. But that's my worry. I'm worried that every Marvel film will try to outdo the predecessors by being bigger and better every time, until the MCU is eventually crushed by its own unattainable expectations. But until that day, I'll enjoy what the MCU has to offer. I expect great things from the next one: Doctor Strange. Great things, indeed. #TEAMCAP

314,15 April 2016,helderapfsousa,10," A great movie dedicated to all DC fan boys butt hurt about how mediocre BvS was!!!
","I've seen Deadpool and it was great. I've seen Batkill v Supersad Dawn of Martha and was a mediocre, dull of a movie. Now get ready to be amazed! This movie pushed the boundaries in terms of superhero films. The Russo brothers did something I did not expect, exceed The Winter Soldier and make not only the best Marvel movie so far but the best movie in its genre so far. Civil War not only offers great action but also very good character development, strong performances from each member of the cast and more than enough screen time for everyone. From a technical standpoint the movie is, just like The Winter Soldier a delight. Practical effects, very good implementation of CGI, beautiful camera work and choreography, sound and a solid script. The globetrotting plot kicks off in Lagos, where Cap and the new-look Avengers are on a mission to take down Winter Soldier survivor Crossbones. Civil War starts as a muscular crime movie in the mould of Michael Mann's Heat, the Russo brothers significantly upping their game in terms of high-impact, shield- slinging action. The mission is a bust ‚Äì the latest in a laundry list of collateral-damage catastrophes from the battle of New York to the near-apocalypse in Sokovia, leading to the creation of the Sokovia Accords, a decree to put the super crew on ice unless an international governing body gives the green light. Having lived through oppressive times, Cap takes a stance against the agreement;Tony Stark, wrecked with guilt over the creation of Ultron, sides with Ross and the Accords. Battle lines drawn, matters are further complicated by Bucky Barnes, who's implicated in a terrorist attack that puts both sides, and a certain Wakandan prince, on the Winter Soldier's tail. If The Winter Soldier was about SHIELD being ripped apart from the inside, Civil War pulls the same trick with the Avengers themselves, screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely carving out satisfying character arcs. Crucially, despite the colossal cast of characters and sprawling runtime this isn't just Avengers 2.5 holds true, it's also a Captain America movie through and through, further exploring The Winter Soldier's major theme ‚Äì the cost of freedom ‚Äì while Bucky is even more integral to the plot than he was in the film that bore his own name. As you might expect, it's one of the MCU's more serious entries, tonally a world away from the party-time antics of Age of Ultron. But that doesn't mean it's humorless; far from it. Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson can be relied upon for laugh-out-loud one-liners whenever he's on screen, the Vision's stylish new wardrobe is comedy gold and Paul Rudd's Scott Lang is huge fun in a relatively brief appearance ‚Äì utterly enamoured by Steve Rogers and overjoyed just to have been invited along. As a piece of superhero storytelling, it doesn't bring anything particularly innovative to the table either ‚Äì the idea of a thin line between heroes and vigilantes is invoked again, for example. But importantly, given the callous loss of life going on in other comic-book movies, the human cost of the Avengers' actions is keenly felt and addressed in a meaningful way. It makes DC's efforts to tackle the same idea with Batman v Superman seem thunderously dunderheaded in comparison. Chris Evans is dependably superb as Steve Rogers ‚Äì the stoic heart and soul of the MCU. And though he doesn't have as much to chew on here as he did in The Winter Soldier, there's little doubt why anyone would risk being branded a fugitive to follow him into battle. Even better is Robert Downey Jr, who shows a different side to Tony Stark. He's less the swaggering snark merchant of movies past here and more the elder statesman, reflecting on the consequences of his actions and looking to make amends. ""I'm trying to keep you from tearing the Avengers apart,"" he pleads. The brilliance of Downey Jr's sympathetic performance is that even if you're staunchly Team Cap you still feel for him. As for the other players: Bucky is more tortured soul than Terminator this time round, and though he can still feel more MaGuffin than character at times, you buy why he's worth saving because Sebastian Stan and Chris Evans sell their life-long friendship so well. Scarlet Witch struggles to deal with the implications of her immense power; Hawkeye comes out of retirement in a satisfying continuation of his Age Of Ultron arc; Falcon gets to show off what those wings can really do; and War Machine takes the hardest line for the Accords, ever the iron patriot. More importantly: how do the MCU's new supers stack up? Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther has a bigger role than you might expect. Arriving fully formed, Boseman plays the prince of Wakanda with regal airs, charm and forceful determination. For Very Important Story Reasons he's quite sullen in Civil War but in his vibranium suit T'Challa is just as capable and acrobatically dazzling as any of the MCU's super-folk, with a set of razor-sharp claws that even Cap's shield can't withstand. Better yet is Marvel's all-new Spider-Man. In asurprisingly substantial appearance, 19- year-old Tom Holland not only makes a case for being the best screen Spidey so far, but also threatens to steal the entire film. His Peter Parker is perfect ‚Äì nervy, goofy and instantly endearing. In the airport fight however he's truly spectacular, holding his own against the best the MCU has to offer, using his webs in entertaining and creative ways, while his motor-mouthed (and charmingly naive) wisecracking couldn't be better. Civil War isn't just a damn-near-perfect popcorn crowd-pleaser; it doesn't offer any easy answers for its combatants, or the world going forward. Team Cap or Team Iron Man? The real winner here is Team Marvel.""",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

Captain America goes rogue in order to save his friend Bucky - that's understandable. But it is up to Iron Man to bring his friend in.

Captain America, had more Avengers then first two Avengers film put together. It showcased new characters and gave more back story to; Black Panther, Ant-man, Vision, Scarlet Witch and Spider-man. That is a lot of new super heroes to give screen time, considering you still have the big players like Captain America, Iron-man, War Machine, Black Widow, Hawk-eye, Winter Soldier and Falcon.

","This was the best Marvel movie so far! I am writing this review after around the 7th time I have watched the movie, and it is still one of the best I have ever seen, it never gets old. This movie was perfect in every way. It was basically an Avengers movie, with a Captain America story line with Sam and Steve trying to find Bucky. I thought it was great how the writers were able to tie in an Avengers movie plot with the accords, and a Captain America plot with the whole Bucky situation. That lead to two final battle scenes. When the Avengers civil war fight at the airport was over, there was a whole new fight in Siberia with Captain America, Bucky and Tony. Basically the last hour of the movie is constant action. I thought Daniel Br√ºhl played Zemo perfectly, and I loved how even though never directly being in the same building as most of the Avengers, he was able to ignite the Civil War between them. I also really liked how we were introduced to three new characters fight with the Avengers. I know Ant-Man made his debut the movie before, but he is still a new character, and it was cool to see him with the other Avengers. I was also thrilled to see the introduction of Black Panther and Spider-Man. It was great how Marvel introduced them without needing a solo movie. They kind of just threw them into the universe, but they did it flawlessly. I also liked how Marvel didn't feel they needed to show Spider-Man's origin again, Peter was bitten by the Spider six months before Civil War, that means his first solo movie will jump right into the action without needing to show the spider bite. I though once again they did a great job casting, Chadwick Boseman and Tom Holland were great and they play their roles to perfection, I can't wait to see their solo movies again, and I also can't wait to see what the future holds for the Avengers.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

It's not a masterpiece like everyone's saying it is. I think people are just so relieved it didn't turn out like Batman Vs. Superman they're giving it ludicrously high ratings. It takes a little while to get going and the political themes are handled with the simplicity of a primary school politics lesson, but the emotional stuff is handled very well. The collapse in the Avengers alliance is believable and sad, the humour is still there, the action scenes are awesome and the Russo Brothers once again prove themselves fine directors. The performances are all-around excellent, with Robert Downey Jr. giving possibly his best MCU performance to date. I have a bad feeling that once the dust settles people will look upon this less favourably, but this is a very good blockbuster, and tells the story of a small-scale superhero conflict (In the comics the civil war seems to have been far bigger) with intelligence, humour and glorious pyrotechnics.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

On my first watch on April 27th (first screening), the theater was packed and the crowd reaction was the best i have seen since the first Avengers movie, but that was nothing compared with seeing my old man's reactions. I just wanted to share this because if any movie deserves to be ranked top just by the sheer joy it causes, is this one. An excellent movie, full of surprises (I have seen just the first trailer prior to watching the movie, and avoided spoilers like the plague). Acting-wise, the characters were spot-on, some of the best moments were the ones without any special effect, and the ones that used them were wisely edited. About the villain: a superb and realistic plan (within the boundaries of their universe). Only minor gripe was Martin Freeman overacting. Otherwise, the introduction of characters (new to the universe or to the Captain/Avengers films) was perfect, and rest assured, this is the best on-film version of the web-crawler yet!

347,29 April 2016,helswan,9," A thoroughly entertaining movie from start to finish with exhilarating action sequences and intriguing personal motivations that gives gravitas to the comic book movie genre.
","Digression : I saw this film at Trinoma in Cinema 5. I was excited to be going in early for the trailers but my excitement turned into disappointment when they dedicated the majority of the screen time for trailers to advertisements. Since this film is property of Walt Disney Studios, the trailers that show up are also upcoming projects of Disney. While this is a brilliant marketing strategy for Disney, it is also a cruel one for the other studios especially the indie ones. This will hurt the other studios' box office numbers and potentially ruin the success of indie films. I hope in the near future Disney Studios would give way to the other studios for the betterment of the film industry. But we all know that wont happen anytime soon. On with the review! When the world divides their opinions about the future operations of the world's greatest heroes, Steve Rogers and Tony Stark's political opinions clash causing the divide of the Avengers. Let me start by saying that the action, drama and comedy in this film are well balanced and well executed which crafts a smooth and seamless story line. This is the amazing work that the Russo Brothers are capable of. The implementation of comedy for a movie like this was needed to be executed carefully and they managed to pull it off. While the tension builds between Captain America and Iron Man, we get to deeply explore their character motivations and beliefs throughout the movie. With the previous heroic acts that Tony Stark had, we are now met with a guilty and troubled character. His matured character arc was interesting to dissect because we see him constantly trying to contain each member of the Avengers and take responsibility for their actions while handling the diplomatic relations and internal heartbreak that was caused by Pepper Potts. On the opposite corner, we have Steve Rogers who is fighting for his beliefs even if he has to go against the law just to protect his long time friend Bucky. These character depths add emotional weight to the story which leads us to have more difficulty on which team to root for as both sides have been well developed. The new heroes that are introduced to us in this movie are Black Panther and Spider-Man. They were given enough screen time and their performances were amazing. I'm surprised that Black Panther was given a lot of screen time considering that the audience isn't familiar with his background. Spider-Man was a strong element in this film. The scenes he's in provide comedic relief, but his CGI suit looked very unrealistic and half-baked. One nitpick I have for this movie is that when we are transported to a different place or another time line, there are these huge, white texts that pop out of the screen. It didn't ruin the whole movie for me but it was a bit distracting. The action scenes in here are amazing. The way team members capitalize on their abilities by working together and mixing up their offenses is a spectacle to behold. Each battle is intense and the final battle between Captain America and Iron Man will send shivers down your spine and that freeze frame during their final battle will make your jaw drop. Final thoughts : Comic book readers might not appreciate it that much because the film differs itself a little. What comic book readers should understand here is that the MCU(Marvel Cinematic Universe) is riding on the momentum and the world they created. Films are harder to produce and it takes a lot of time and patience to set up character backgrounds. In the end this is the closest adaptation we will get and it was a damn great effort. This was a very entertaining movie with interesting layers and deep character motivations. The audience that i saw it with even clapped because of sheer enjoyment and I left the cinema with a huge smile on my face I give Captain America : Civil War a 9/10",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

","Debatably the smartest and most unique mcu film. From the beginning of the film it picks off instantly and sets the tone for the film really well. I love how the avengers are faced to realise the aftermath and damage that they have caused and how it creates a strong divide and a conflict between friends, allies. What is so gripping about it is that both sides have strong arguments which makes the audience jump between sides and look at the teams views from a separate angle. There is some confusion amongst all the politics like how captain America didn't tell tony that Bucky was framed, I can't understand that but it makes no difference. The action is probably the best out of any mcu film, the choreography is amazing, the camera angles even better. The soundtrack...omg the soundtrack is excellent especially when they clash at the airport, I got goosebumps. The movie has quite a strong emotional tole as well, mainly towards the end, just watching these characters beat the hell out of each other after such long development and friendships built up between one another. The villain is really strong aswell, I'm not saying he's unique but it was bold for a marvel movie to use a villain with no real physical attributes that are superior to the heroes. I cannot praise this movie enough and frankly it is a bit underrated against the other marvel movies. 9/10 Solid stuff.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

But this time they did well and experimented by adding Black Panther to the cast who hasn't yet had a solo movie. Apart from all the brilliant performances, the addition of Spider- Man to this Universe was welcoming. Hope this phase also builds up the story of Infinity War slowly and steadily.

Both have equal opinions about why they're right, which makes it very hard to distinguish who's right and who's wrong, which is great film-making.

","In a year with quite a few Superhero movies coming out, I'm surprised to see that this movie gets all the love. I went in the movie theater expecting so much, and came out feeling disappointed. Although I do believe this movie is better than Age of Ultron (that one was pretty terrible), Captain America: Civil War was not much better. I'm starting to feel that Marvel can't do anything different. These movies don't take risks (like the comics actually do), and they still don't have a great villain in this film. Marvel in general just has terrible villains, and Zemo in this film was no exception. There was nothing villainous about him, and he was just so bland. The fight scenes were okay, but not as epic as they could've been. This movie was so hyped, and all I heard was that it was so amazing, and that it is the best comic book movie ever, but after seeing the film I know that isn't true. Marvel movies are starting to get stale, and uninteresting. Also, why isn't this called Avengers: Civil War? There is no way this movie can be a Captain America movie. It seems like the people at Marvel are just trying to sell Captain America, because I cannot see how they could even call this Captain America: Civil War. At least Spiderman was cool, but he had a very tiny part, smaller than I expected. He was one of the main guys in the comics, but not in this film. But as we all know, Marvel doesn't stay true to the source material, and in this movie's case, that is very true.

As expected the CGI and Stunt team does a fantastic job, better actually, than Winter Soldier which is in itself a masterpiece. Those of us, someone like me who haven't read much of the comics, may be expecting a different plot/background on which the 'Civil War' happens...although the movie takes on many different angles and perspectives through which we can see the characters in new light. With Winter Soldier, they've already laid the platform for this one and it builds beautifully on it. Marvel has always had this knack of handling multiple characters and preserving their individuality while keeping them in sync with the plot, and it doesn't disappoint this time as well. Quite a few character introductions were hinted in the trailers itself what with Black Panther and Spidey coming back to the MCU. What is impeccable is they give each character its own space while still building up on the story. A lot of tussle, both emotional and physical can be seen between the so-called two teams, each member struggling in their own stead of facing someone who until quite recently was fighting with them side by side.

Subsequently, the Avengers have a ""Civil war"" in which they destroy each other, with each feeling as though they are doing the logical and ethical thing.

","If Captain America: The Winter Soldier wasn't enough proof that the Russo brothers are some of the most capable superhero movie directors of our time, this is. Captain America: Civil War is possibly one of the best directed superhero movies ever made. The story is very well thought out and does justice to the characters, while simultaneously developing said characters beyond what we've seen of them in previous movies. It's surprising that even though this is the fifth movie starring Chris Evans as Captain America, there still seems to be things we can learn about him. I was never the biggest Captain America fan, and as I went in to the cinema I was decidedly on Iron Man's team, but you cannot help but feel very conflicted between the two from start to finish. The Russos' keep you gripped for the entire movie, and there really isn't a dull moment. Perhaps that's because of the constant flow of action sequence after action sequence, which felt overwhelming at times (pretty much every ten minutes or so another giant fight took place). However in my eyes this was undoubtedly the best action in any superhero movie (the sequence in the airport is nothing short of mesmerising), from The Avengers to The Dark Knight. The story is also surprisingly thought-provoking, as it not only explores themes never before seen in a Marvel movie but also continues to show the Russos' talent for storytelling.

","Captain America:Civil War hands down is one of the greatest movies to ever come to the MCU. After political conflict between the Avengers and other foreign country's, the return of William Hurt's General Thunderbolt Ross introduces the Sokovia Accords that will either cause the Avengers to give up their rights to fight any threat where they choose or force them to retire. When it causes Steve Rogers/Captain America and Tony Stark/Iron Man to take different sides on the Accords, tensions are higher than ever causing each Avenger to choose their side. When a attack on foreign diplomats that leaves King T'Chaka of Wakanda dead and Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier is framed, it's up to Captain America to help save his friend and prove his innocence with the remaining Avengers on his side while the other half of them are fighting against them. First off, this is probably my favorite film to feature Chris Evan's Steve Rogers/Captain America, because it forces him to choose between what he believes is right and what he thinks is wrong. It's also one of my favorite films to feature Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark/Iron Man, because it shows a side of him we haven't gotten to see before until now. Scarlett Johansson's Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow is stunning as always. Sebastian Stan's Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier is fantastic while also giving showing us more of his now more sensitive side while also showing more of his sinister past. The film also introduces us to new characters like Chadwick Boseman's Prince T'Challa/Black Panther who was born to play this role and Tom Holland's Peter Parker/Spider-Man which is also fantastic. I was also glad to see other hero's join this film such as Paul Rudd's Scott Lang/Ant-Man, Jeremy Renner's Clint Barton/ Hawkeye, Paul Bettany's Vision, Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson/Falcon, Elizabeth Olsen's Wanda Maximoff, and Don Cheadle's Rhodey/War Machine. The film not only introduces us to one of my personal favorite villains of the MCU with Daniel Br√ºhl's Helmut Zemo, but he gives us a villain that doesn't need any form of superpower to defeat his enemies. Only his actions. This film hands down is one of the best films to come to the MCU, that is one of its most memorable, action packed, dark at times, and emotional that has viewers watching all the way to the end.

They take their time in developing their wacky, comic-book universe while virtually blending it with the modern real universe, They care about these characters and their struggles so much as to have us care about them as well.

If there are casualties when they ply their individual trades, imagine the carnage without them. Of course, I had all I could do to figure out which side they are on. I guess ""Civil War"" means that they are fighting among themselves in their own universe. What are the motivations? My son also informed me that there are at least a dozen or more superhero films coming out in the next two years. Good God!

","This is not technically a sequel to the Captain America series, it is more like another Avengers movie, the only Marvel characters missing are Nick Fury, Thor and the Hulk, so I looked forward to it, from director brothers Anthony and Joe Russo (Welcome to Collinwood, You, Me and Dupree, Captain America: The Winter Soldier). Basically the Avengers: Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans), Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Sam Wilson aka Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Wanda Maximoff aka Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen, Mary-Kate and Ashley's sister) cause unintentional destruction whilst saving the world, the team are brought before U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt). Ross informs the team that the United Nations (UN) will have a panel determine their control for protection of the world, the team is divided: Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) supports oversight because he feels the destruction, but Rogers has more faith in his judgement than the government. A bomb explosion occurs in Vienna, security footage indicates the bomber is brainwashed super-soldier Bucky Barnes aka Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), King T'Chaka (John Kani) is killed and his son T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) vows to kill the Barnes. The government intends to kill Barnes, Rogers wants to bring him, as his childhood friend and war comrade, Rogers and Wilson find him in Bucharest, but they, Barnes and T'Challa, as his alter ego the Black Panther, are arrested. Helmut Zemo (Rush's Daniel Br√ºhl) kills Barnes's old Hydra handler and steals a book containing trigger words that activate Barnes's brainwashing, infiltrating the facility Barnes is being held Zemo recites these words to make Barnes obey him, Zemo questions him, then sends him on a rampage. Rogers stops Barnes, he regains his senses and explains that Zemo is the real Vienna bomber, he wanted the location of of the Siberian Hydra base, where other brainwashed super-soldiers are kept in cryogenic stasis, unwilling to wait for authorisation to apprehend Zemo, Rogers and Wilson go rogue, recruiting Maximoff, Clint Barton aka Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Scott Lang aka Ant-Man (Paul Rudd). Ross gives permission to Stark to capture the renegades, he assembles Romanoff and T'Challa in a team, along with Lieutenant James Rhodes aka War Machine (Don Cheadle), Vision (Paul Bettany) and new recruit Peter Parker aka Spider-Man (The Impossible's Tom Holland). Stark's team and Rogers' team come face to face at Leipzig/Halle Airport, they fight each other and cause destruction around them, until Romanoff allows Rogers and Barnes to escape, the rest of Rogers' team are captured and held at the Raft prison, Vision inadvertently shot down Rhodes causing him to be partially paralysed, and Romanoff is forced to go into hiding. Stark discovers evidence that Zemo framed Barnes and shows Wilson the evidence, Wilson gives Rogers' location, Stark goes to the Siberian Hydra facility, Rogers and Barnes are there and they strike a truce, T'Challa secretly followed, they discover the other super-soldiers have been killed Zemo, who shows Hydra archive footage that brainwashed Barnes was responsible for the death of Stark's parents, thought to be killed in an automobile accident. Stark is enraged that Rogers was aware of this and turns on them, blasting off Barnes' robotic arm, Rogers disables Stark's armour and escapes with Barnes, leaving his shield behind, Zemo is satisfied he has fractured the Avengers and attempts suicide, but T'Challa stops him and takes him to the authorities. In the aftermath, Rhodes is provided with exoskeletal leg braces to walk again, Rogers breaks his allies out of the Raft, Barnes is granted asylum by T'Challa and put into cryogenic sleep until a cure for his brainwashing can be found, Stark reads a letter from Rogers which assures him there can be a future for the Avengers, and Parker is seen testing a new gadget from Stark. Also starring Emily VanCamp as Sharon Carter, Frank Grillo as Brock Rumlow aka Crossbones, Martin Freeman as Everett K. Ross, Marisa Tomei as Aunt May Parker, John Slattery as Howard Stark, Hope Davis as Maria Stark, Alfre Woodard as Miriam Sharpe and Stan Lee as FedEx Driver. Evans and Downey Jr. dominate most of the picture with their acting skills, but it is great to see all the superheroes together again, the highlight is when they all clash, fight together and destroy an airport, the introductions of the Black Panther and web-slinging Spider-Men is well done, there is a good mixture of high-octane energy and a little needed humour, the special effects for the super powers and explosions are fantastic, and the story is relatively interesting, all in all it is a great fun action adventure.

They actually gave each character a chance to shine in their own respect. Which I thought was outstanding. The action was expertly done, with minimal CGI and lots of hand-to-hand combat, which is how it should be done. In summary, this film has made me very excited for Infinity War.

","It is no secret that I am very critical of MCU films and have lost all hope in their content, if there was any doubt all it would take is a look at my review of Ragnarok movie.
However while Ragnarok was an insult to the Thor and Hulk as characters and their respectively amazing and deep storylines the Civil War is an insult to the audiences.
The downfall of MCU storytelling comes with Civil War, this film is so boring and so unimaginably stupid that I have yet to watch it and not feel the urge to have my palm meet my face in a facepalm so inevitable you would say it was 8 years into making.
The real problem here is the way the story goes about to justify its events when nothing in it makes any sense.
Anyone even remotely familiar with the Civil War ark of stories from Marvel comics would tell you that Civil War movie is not even in the slightest remotely like the source material.
Lets say for the sake of the argument that we are going to ignore the source material (Even though that is a big mistake for any medium that is basing its content on a source material that is established and well known) and just focus on what we are given we are presented with such a bad story telling it turns out to be worse than Iron Man 3's entire second half and then some.
This movie presents you with challenges that are none existent, like blames put on our characters that are baseless, in one scene we go through all the wrong the Heroes have done while completely ignoring the fact that literally none of these were at any part the heroe's fault and to top it off the one that was their fault (the situation in Africa in Age of Ultron) is not even addressed in that particular scene.
Then we have back and forward about what is right and what is wrong and it just falls flat with really little reason to consider any argument but the argument presented by Captain America.
You see that comes from inconsistent story telling, in another scene Captain America is considering reverting his decision only to change his mind again because of a simple thing as one person being kept hidden because they are probably unstable (hello? since when Captain America suddenly has a problem with that? did this dude forget Hulk being kept hidden a big part of Avengers 2 or other times they had to hide for similar reasons?)
The villain is worse than Iron man 2 and 3 combined, his actions are unnecessarily convoluted and go through complex hoops that makes you wonder if there is more about this character we are not being told.
For example he has knowledge about some stuff that he is going to use for his scheme.
Information exclusive to Hydra big guys and this guy had nothing to do with Hydra, so what gives?
This thing just goes on and on when it should have not taken half as long as the time it took to put 2 plus 2 together to get the answer which is 4 not 5!",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

","So far we had many comic book movies, but we never had so far, THE comic book movie. Not until Civil War! The Russo brothers did something I did not expect, exceed The Winter Soldier and make not only the best Marvel movie so far but the best movie in its genre so far. The movie is not only an epic proportioned spectacle but also a very well thought conclusion to what previous movies have been leading up to. From a technical standpoint the movie is, just like The Winter Soldier a delight. Practical effects, very good implementation of CGI, beautiful camera work and choreography, sound and a solid script. The Russo brothers take action to another step with amazingly cut action scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat. I need to mention that Captain America Civil War has one of the best action scenes I have seen, ever. The movie not only offers great action but also very good character development, strong performances from each member of the cast and more than enough screen time for everyone. The newcomers, Black Panther and Spiderman are as expected among the highlights of this spectacular flick. The movie has its issues, while it is up for debate the villain played by Daniel Bruhl is most definitely the biggest low in this movie along with some specific scenes where the editing can get a little confusing and tiresome making it hard to keep track on what is happening on screen. With all these said the movie is absolutely excellent and a whole new level for comic book movies.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

Vision isn't really developed much and the only development his character receives is in his relationships. Black panther, as a new character he hasn't been developed, was devolved slightly and we see his passion for what he believes in play out. Spider-Man is amazingly developed and the new Peter Parker is best one so far.

","This movie has great action. The opening sequence, the airport fight, and the final confrontation all have great choreography and a creative use of each character's abilities. As far as a spectacle goes, Civil War did everything right. The problem is that you can't just throw action figures at each other with characters this complex. You need to really earn it and convince the audience that these characters would be fighting. Batman v Superman had its problems, but I thought it did a better job of a. Convincing us that the world would object to Superman and b. Convincing us that Batman and Superman would hate each other. This movie accomplishes neither for the airport fight. I really don't believe anyone in this scene would be punching each other besides Black Panther trying to kill Bucky. It just feels weird, out of character, and out of place. It felt like they wanted them to fight and just hacked together a story reason for it to happen without planning it well enough ahead of time. I will note, though, that the final confrontation between Iron Man and Captain America is perfection. That one was 100% earned. I believed that Iron Man wanted to kill them, and it felt cathartic when they fought. They were effective in using these characters against each other. The Sokovia Accords, on the other hand, do not make sense in context. Ross shows a bunch of videos of the Avengers saving the day. Would they rather have had Loki kill everybody? Or SHIELD exterminate a million people a minute? And when Wanda takes out a floor of a building, keep in mind that if she didn't do anything, it would've exploded in the middle of a public square with way more people. The only thing the government is right about is that Tony Stark should go to jail for building Ultron. But why they're blaming the Avengers for a minimal amount of collateral damage when saving the planet is mind-blowing. Batman v Superman framed Superman and got the public mad at him for stuff he didn't do, which works. Civil War tries to convince us that the stuff the Avengers did do was bad, which doesn't work. The whole point of the ending of the first Avengers with the woman talking about how Captain America saved her life is about how the Avengers were heroes. Sure, there was some initial skepticism, but it's now been years. Nobody should doubt that the Avengers are heroes, especially the government. Did they forget that Quicksilver sacrificed himself to save a random kid in Sokovia? In order for the Sokovia accords to make sense, the previous movies would've had to show us disregard for civilian life, like maybe them letting that kid die. Build up to Civil War. As it stands, the conflict comes out of nowhere. A civil war was not earned, and that's really important for me enjoying the movie.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

Anthony Mackie stays awesome as falcon and has a couple standout moments. Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes/winter solider is fantastic a great and strong performance from him. and i also want to point out that Elizabeth Olsen was much improved as scarlet witch i thought she was a bit underdeveloped in age of Ultron but she had a fantastic arc in this film. the airport battle is phenomenal one of the best superhero action set pieces seriously it's crazy i couldn't believe what is was watching. there is only one thing that was bad about it which has become very familiar in marvel movies the villains. once again marvel makes a another generic and disposable villain in Baron Zemo its a shame because Daniel Bruhl is a really good actor. but i look at it that he wasn't really a villain this film didn't need a villain it was a family dispute between the avengers. but other than that overall it was a very good and entertaining movie which makes sure the marvel train keeps on rolling 10/10",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

Continuing the epic traditional fighting sequences from previous episode, the 13th outing of this MCU adventure offers a wide variety range of action scenes and it is evenly distributed among all the superheroes through efficient cinematography of switching without focusing much on gunshots, smashing and explosions. All characters are engaging thanks to the compelling character developments; Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr. and Sebastian Stan deliver well as their roles respectively in term of resolving the challenge of their friendship test, the other Avengers perform outstanding too especially the brought in of Spider-Man, Back Panther and Ant-Man have added more fun and joy which is entirely absent in DC's Dawn of Justice. It is emotional, inspiring and perfectly crafted, implying that the actions chosen between the two main characters are not anything about right or wrong, but more on perceptions and the outcomes. While the Captain America trilogy is not up to The Dark Knight trilogy masterpiece, the decision to explore thought- provoking themes have made it one of the most impressive series in MCU.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

","So... after a non-stop run of sequential violence (That's the story line of Marvell), now comes the PC curve, really?
Trying to hit the brakes, and do a cerebral attempt at a show, is a noble change up (not really), but doesn't work. it smacks of raw inauthenticity; it's the Marvel style and now a writer wants to be PC and sincere(?) Never mind the convention to be violent and then say you're not, and make the viewer feel guilty. Never mind the violent-tepid-violent frame, which throws the viewer off (it's like domestic violence syndrome... victim calls police, they show up, offender immediately feigns calmness and points to hysterical victim, which is what cops only see. And victim is at fault for thinking that!).
Never mind that hypocrisy. At least make sense whilst being confusing.
An Accord? Aliens blew up the world each move, Heros battle (gee, can't imagine why any global damage spillover), and so get rid of Avengers...? They should have said, ""Okay"", and go hide. See what happens. 
How about next time an alien race invades earth, the General stops them and has them sign a damage control accord. Maybe asks them to say ""sorry"" whilst they are fulfilling their agenda on destruction. Yeah, that feels right. 
And, in the story line, only Capt. Amer. sees footage? No one else sees the security camera of ""psychiatrist:, just go to war. Man, we had enough of that damn Stark conceited arse! (like previous movie said, he can't tell the difference between creating and destroying the world. That's who should be deciding things?)
""Now, lets be sensitive...unless we're not, but feel should be, while not to be... unless saying sorry, but don't..."".
Same approach-avoidant contradictions.

Me being a comic book fan and a die hard Marvel fan I was excited for what Marvel will bring to the table next, because ever since The Avengers and its sequel Avengers Age Of Ultron I enjoy each Marvel film because Marvel brings all the good things to the table for what comic book fans want. I was able to watch an advance screening of this movie at IMAX with my sister and it seriously blew me away even when I watched it for the second time with my sister at the Director's Club it still kept me on the edge of my seat and the third time I watched it with my parents yesterday it still satisfied me, I can truly say that Marvel is on the right direction of their movies compared to DC. I was very surprised with Captain America Civil War because this film did a very superb and outstanding job in terms of storytelling and introducing new characters who we will see in their future solo movies and this also acts as an incredible end to the story of the great Captain America. The story is very engaging and well paced, it seriously puts the movie in a whole new level and the action is just awesome plus the humor and jokes are even funnier when compared to its predecessor. But the film's true highlight (SPOILER ALERT FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM YET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) is the introduction of Spider Man because we all know that when the second trailer was released we get to see our favorite web swinger in the Marvel Cinematic Universe kick some butts and he is seriously well done and better than in my opinion Tobey Maguire. The same can be said to Black Panther, who I can't wait for his own solo film and is well portrayed in this movie. This film shows proof that Marvel is always on the right spot and track when it comes to their films and it is better than Batman V Superman, because this movie has all the good elements that was not in Batman V Superman that is joy and humor.

With so many characters thrown together in the same film, and new ones introduced, it would be so easy to lose track of some of the characters' story development. The writers deserve some praise in this case because they succeeded in keeping all the characters' own storylines going throughout around the main plot. All the avengers are there, apart from Thor and The Hulk - off on their own adventures. As usual the quality of acting is good from the usual suspects. Though it's the couple of new additions that I enjoyed the most. Black Panther was really cool. Spiderman was also refreshing adding some hilarious lines.

Some great action sequences, as well as convincing passionate battles. Also does a great job at delving into moral issues that divide us. The writing was very convincing, great dialogue all-round. Effects were magical, done very well. Great film overall, not my favourite Marvel addition but certainly brings a harsher change to a fun-filled franchise.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

There is this lady Superhero, who can conjure up heat and light by manipulating her fingers, much like a puppeteer is wont to do. Another Superhero can achieve instant communication and teleportation by tapping a contraption worn on his wrist. But not all of them are tech-savvy; there is a Superhero still using bow and arrow.

Collateral damage comes home to roost for the Avengers superhero adventurers. Some agree to being, others do not. It's an interesting, topical story direction and it's a more mature and substantive picture because of it.
Compared to the previous films in the series, the fighting sequences have a little more purpose, showing the dynamics of their abilities, and while the set pieces go on too long, they are impressive. Tension reduces because it doesn't convince why the allies are opposing each other with lethal intent.

It's all makes sense why they do this and why they do that in airport scene no one is trying to kill because team iron mans plan is to just arrest them and team cap was to go beat up assassins. And how visions missing for half of fight scene because he's kind of in the middle and only got involved when he beloved he needed to. Zemo is developed enough and man driven by vengeance what else do you need to know like really the one thing I don't agree with is people calling him a weak villain his plan to turn them against each other would have probz been better if Tony killed Bucky but I didn't want anyone to die because thanos will be a massive threat and they need everyone . There's a lot going on in the movie and introduction to two knew characters which were amazing but this was kind of a test for the russos and every flaw they have in this will be perfected in infinity war first they only had to deal with cap widow fury and Sam but now they had all superheroes except 2 but for a first try they did great and I know infinity war is in good hands after seeing what they have done with this movie where they got to bring all avengers together.,/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

There's no place called ""T'Chaka"" or ""Wakanda"" and we have kings but they are very traditional so they don't do politics that often. We run a democratic system of Government in Nigeria, we have a President and Governors and even Local Government Chairmen. If anybody is going to represent Nigeria it's gonna be the President not a King. At the United Nations conference in the movie he said something like ""kosi"" which should mean ""thank you"", although we have so many languages in Nigeria and Lagos is like a ""united state"" or a metropolis everyone comes to do business here, I may not know all the languages but Lagos is known for these five languages namely; English, Yoruba, Hausa , Igbo and Pidgin (our own version of English, its like a not so fluent version of English with modifications. Its common among illiterates but we have all come to understand and use it informally both literate and illiterate alike.) but the language used in the scene seemed like Yoruba if it is then its wrong the right word would have been ""Ose"" pronounced ""Oshay"".

First of all, I'll say this is a good movie full of action, comedy and excitement, like all of the other Avengers movies. The big problem I have with this movie, like I have stated with all of the other movies in this series, is that it lacks real drama. By that I mean, because there is already the announcement of 2 more Avenger movies means that you know how it will end going in, this one had a chance to go dark and really change the game for this series, but once again, it got wrapped in a bow and left me feeling like this is just another in the line of movies made in order to make money and not offer drama. I liked Batman v Superman because of the drama. That movie did have major flaws, but because it ended with the death of a major character. Even though they are coming back for the next movie it set a precedent that makes you go into the next one wondering who won't make it out alive. I'm not a big fan of comic book movies, but the ones I do like are dark, gritty, and makes you wonder what is going to happen. To me the Marvel movies don't.

",Civil War blends the incredible action sequences and humor from The Avengers while also bringing real depth and pathos to plot and character that was done so well in The Winter Soldier. It really is every comic geeks dream come true to see these kinds of movies brought to the screen like this so well. The film is stuffed full of so many beloved characters yet somehow pulls it off. Chadwick Bosemans Black Panther is a fascinating character I am already eager to see develop more in his own movie and Paul Rudd as Ant Man is a welcome addition to the team and steals every scene he is in. Of course the biggest treat is Tom Holland as Spider-Man who reboots the character in the best way possible and gives much promise to his own movie franchise.

","When superheroes battle their evil counterparts, there is almost always major collateral damage. It is a rare occasion when they meet in a remote area such as the Sahara Desert. These battles also often include the deaths or serious injury of innocent bystanders. Concerned about this, governments around the world have banded together under the United Nations banner to write a series of regulations governing the superhero group the Avengers.
Captain America (Steve Rogers) is opposed to signing the new law while Iron Man (Tony Stark) is strongly in favor. This creates a major rift in the Avengers with the others being forced to take sides. At first the conflict is verbal only, but there is an incident where it breaks out into open conflict. Hence the term ""Civil War."" It is superhero against superhero in a battel that shatters unity and leads to hostility and serious injury. Tony Stark is torn when he visits the penal facility where some of the Avengers are being held under special and very restrictive controls.
The action is intense with a great deal of hand-to-hand fighting. It would seem unlikely that Captain American would stand a chance against the armored Iron Man, but he holds his own. Punches and other items are thrown, bodies fly and there is some literal blood drawn. The dialog is also very good, while there are a few instances where a clich√© is dropped, they are very rare.
Two high points of the dialog were very amusing. When Tony Stark is trying to convince Peter Parker (Spider-Man) to leave town and aid him in his task of rounding up the renegade Avengers his response is, ""I can't, I have homework."" The second is the cameo by legend Stan Lee. He plays a deliveryman with a package for ""Tony Snark.""",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

In a way both sides were right and both sides were wrong and to me that's part of what made this film so great. This film would make a nice political debate for some people.

Speaking of which, at first Iron Man was probably my favorite character, but all of them were awesome but now the Black Panther is one of my favorites. What he did and said towards the end of the film is what really did it for me.

","The Avengers and Political Science:
How Captain America: Civil War (2016) Discusses Foreign Policy
Film and comic giant Marvel is no stranger to political influence on their storytelling. In the first Avengers (2012) movie, freedom is threatened by a powerful Norse god named Loki who claims that humanity is designed for submission to a higher power. In the most recent movies, Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019), the villain Thanos pursues utopia and freedom from want by eliminating half the world's population. Both of these movies bring up major political discussions, from the classic freedom vs security argument to the question of how much can be sacrificed for the greater good. The most prevalent movie politically, however, has to be Captain America: Civil War (2016). This movie focuses on the split ideologies between the two leaders in the Avengers crew, Captain America (Steve Rogers) and Iron Man (Tony Stark), with Rogers representing realism and Stark representing Liberalism. These characters clash over debates of how the Avengers should operate as a group of superpowered beings and brings up questions of sovereignty vs regulation.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

2. The combat is a whole lot smoother and fast-paced than the previous films, and the action scenes (particularly the airport fight scene) are fantastically choreographed.
3. The movies' serious and gritty tone works really well, especially with the fissures in the Avengers only heightening said tone, and vice versa.
4. The mixture of practical effects and CGI, for the most part, looks great, and they helped to ground the film in a certain realism.
5. The score helps to lay a suitably tense and stifling atmosphere, without becoming stifling itself.
6. All of the Avengers (both the characters and the actors) have brilliant chemistry with each other.
7. The introductions of Spiderman and Black Panther are amazing, as they're given actual story-arcs which are compelling.
8. Both Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man/ Tony Stark) and Tom Holland deliver fantastic performances.

In my review to B vs S i had written that the reason shown for the fight between Batman and Superman was too silly , and could have been ignored if they could have talked about it. Many viewers on YouTube comments or on other websites have said that , come-on , give them a break , its a comic book movie , don't take it seriously , we need to get the fight of Batman and Superman , doesn't matter whether the reason is strong enough or not. But i say 'NO' , even if it is a comic book movie , we the audience are not fool , and we need strong reason if two of our heroes responsible for our safety are fighting with each other. And in CIVIL WAR , they talk , they counter attack , they try to stop each other , they give their own reasons and when nothing works THEN THEY FIGHT. And hell what a fight it was. Less i talk about the plot more it will be good for you to consume everything from the movie. Basically its about the casualty of people who died when our superheroes goes for big fight. The mass destruction happens , and many people die , and it is somehow the responsibility of the Avengers. Tony Stark , feeling the guilt of his doings in AGE OF ULTRON want to sign the accords of UNITED NATION that from now Avengers will be supervised by UN. We can clearly see why Tony , wants this , its because of his guilt , and he want Avengers to work on a more controlled manner. That's a sufficient reason. On contrary , Steve Rogers don't agree. He say what we do , must be in our hand , we cant be in control of Govt , because govt have agendas , and agendas can change. Here too i can clearly see why Cap America reacted like that , because i have seen how much betrayal he has suffered from the higher authorities in Winter Soldier. Their thinking differs on the moral ground. And nobody is wrong. And you can root for anyone you like (like its currently happening on YouTube , people discussing who is right and who is wrong) . But its not all about UN accords which make these heroes to fight. BUCKY the winter soldier and Cap America's dear friend becomes a very major plot character in the movie which i cannot discuss.

","When it comes to superhero movies they rarely succeed at making the whole saga of movies (specifically trilogy) consistently good. Some might argue The Dark Knight Trilogy is perfect I think that's bullshit, The Dark Knight Rises is a mediocre at best and disappointing finale to what could have been a nice Batman Anthology. Other trilogies that haven't come out well are: X-Men Trilogy (Last Stand wasn't good), Spiderman Trilogy (Spiderman 3 doesn't need explanation), Iron Man Trilogy (neither of the sequels are any good), Blade Trilogy (Trinity sucks) and the old Superman and Batman sagas (sagas which the first two films were actually really good, but the two that followed were laughable corny crap).. Civil War is actually even better than Winter Soldier and First Avenger which is insane. The Russo brothers continue Bucky and Cap's story in this very well crafted adaptation (which actually has little to do with the comics). The performances are great, specially Tom Holland and Chadwick Boseman as the newcomers to the MCU. The airport scene is even better than people are saying. It's as action packed as a film can get.

However in the second half then the movie lost its pace and felt bland.we are introduced to Spider man by tony and his hot aunt May!!(Merissa Tomei nice casting!!)i am still wondering how Tony recognized peter by viewing his videos even though he was wearing a costume and how he got to know where he kept his costume..lol?!!His CGI fights were good.. and then all of a sudden we go into the very hyped up airport scene.Ant man becomes Giant man!! and why was he very slow like he was in slow motion movie!!??funny..Dint like that.Liked Black Panther's stunts!!scene..overall its a long action sequence where everyone seems to be going nuts about it and trust me its definitely not the best action action sequence ever.i have seen waay better ones and this was just OK.Oh Vision wears pants and shirt..what was that!!Also felt Friday(AI system for Tony) a bit fake cos it had emotions and i personally preferred Jarvis but ya that's just my opinion.Music and background score Sucked.cinematography was good .No one dies in the movie.Again the Villain Zemo fails to be a lasting threat in the movie and i seriously feel Marvel lacks in villain department maybe except Loki. People have always compared this Movie to BVS and after watching this movie i can honestly and easily say BVS was hands down wayyy better looking movie.It had the 3 most iconic superheros and bad ass villains.see the difference between these 2 movies was that DC is doing something ballsy,have out of the box approach and have taken risks which i very much like .People nowadays want something different cos maybe they are used to the same formula-tic marvel movies.After viewing i dint feel any emotions that i went through after watching BVS. So ya the movie was just okay-ish and nothing great.if you ask me which i would choose between BVS and civil war , definitely BVS but also i did like this movie but felt it was over hyped and please its not the best CBM SH movie ever!! it was decent flick and that's about it!!",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

They spent time preparing the villain for a chilling yet beautiful scene with Black Panther. This film was heavily foreshadowed by Age of Ultron. But the parts drag, because Baren Zemo does so much and isn't the final fight. But now for the good stuff. Spiderman is best played by Tom Holland. Easily. Another fantastic airport scene. When Black Widow joined Team Stark, her betrayal made a lot of sense. ""Let's see how long this lasts,"" I thought to myself. Also, Rhodey's paralysis really pressed on Stark, and when he discovered how his parent died, that was fantastic. That was a great choice to encourage him early in the film when he is presenting.

659,8 May 2016,Lewis_Heather787,7," An improvement from Age of Ultron
","Civil war is a better improvement from age of ultron but however I feel it doesn't quite live up to the standard set by winter soldier. This film has brilliant performances across most of the board as well as a pretty interesting story to go with it. The Russo brothers have shown how it is possible to have so many characters but able to give each of them enough screen time so that you care about them. They also did a really good job of setting up each side of the arguments of this film whether it be from team cap or team iron man, for me personally I can understand the reasons behind both of them. A Final couple of positives of the film are a few stand out performances, although the majority of them were good. Sebastian Stan as winter soldier is the best part of the film once again, he did a fantastic job as the character and is a step above the rest. Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr also were also really good against each other making you believe the tension between the two characters. A little extra surprise to look for is ant man who is far better in this film than in his own solo film. Now onto the negatives of the film, the first is regarding the title of the film civil WAR. With a name like civil war and in any film with the name war in it, I would not be mistaken to think that one character would probably die. However NONE of the major characters in the airport fight die, winter solider being frozen again doesn't count. I think a more appropriate title for this film would have been, ""Captain America : civil violent argument, but don't worry they will be around for avengers infinity war"". The only other negative I with the film and with most marvel films, apart from winter solider, is there are too many jokes. Age of ultron and guardians of the galaxy are the worst at this and personally whenever a punch line comes up or happens it takes me out of the film. Makes the film and scenes seem childish and that the only purpose is to have a scene is for a joke which I personally find horrible. Finally I must mention this although its like comparing apples to oranges , captain America civil war is a better film than BVS. Although it pains me to say that, being a DC fan, they have a far better story which is simple at its core, however they have had since 2008 to get to this stage.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

","Civil War was nearly flawless. The Russsos did a great job with the combination of sub-plots that were leading to the main plot of the film. A glimpse of overall character backstory and brief introduction for Black Panther and Spider-man was well-done. Every single character deserved a decent amount of screen time, with Bucky's arc and character development being one of the significant elements that led to the string of events that help triggered the tension between Steve and Tony. Steve and Bucky's reunion was the heart of the film and the Russos managed to use that to fuel the fire between all the other characters from both opposing teams, which led to the war. The fighting sequences were extremely flawless and one of the main strong components of the film because they were something that I've never seen before. The highly-anticipated airport scene was so much fun to watch and it really showed how strong characters like Scarlet Witch and Spider- man were because their abilities manage to surpass others at certain points. The only thing I slightly disliked was how Steve and Sharon got together, I just felt like the timing was somewhat inappropriate. However, Steve and Natasha's relationship was what intrigued me instead because you can really see how much they've grown together as a duo from the previous films and it didn't feel foreign at all. Also, I felt like the overall portrayal of Baron Zemo was spectacular, he is probably one of the most sympathetic yet malicious villains Marvel has put out so far and I honestly can't wait to see more from Daniel Bruhl.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

668,19 May 2016,rachaelblakeegypt,10," The next big film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe
","The next big film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe arrives in a slam-dunk fashion, with a great story line and unexpected twists and turns. The cast, once again, as usual, is a standout. Chris Evans still proves that he is Captain America, distilling in him doubt and a questioning manner, while also showing him as a conflicted and true leader. Evans commands the film and ever scenes that he is in, proving that the Marvel Cinematic Universe isn't complete without the character. Robert Downey Jr. once again proves that he is Tony Stark and that no other actor can depict the character. Downey takes a backseat to Evans in good fashion and doesn't try to take the film away from him. This is more Captain America, than Iron Man, with Stark only arriving into the film when necessary and never hogging the film away from Evans. Downey and Evans work well together, while successfully showing the different sides of both characters: Captain America as the leader and Tony Stark as the billionaire, who after the events of Age of Ultron, is guilt ridden. His decision to favor oversight comes from a civilian in Sokovia being killed during the battle, which has a huge impact over the film. Sebastian Stan makes a welcome return to Bucky Barnes, the brainwashed friend of Captain America, code-named the Winter Soldier. Once again this character proves that the Captain America trilogy is about one thing: brotherly love. Stan's depiction brings a sense of doubt and confusion, since he still trying to piece his entire life together, while it also partly ties certain events together. Scarlett Johansson is marvelous as always as Black Widow, delivering great lines and working well opposite both Evans and Downey. Anthony Mackie is once again amazing as Falcon, Captain America's new ally. Don Cheadle still works well with Downey and in the role of James Rhodes, having replaced Terence Howard in Iron Man 2. Jeremy Renner makes a great, small appearance as Hawkeye, as does Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, lending a sense of comedy to the film and giant surprises. Paul Bettany depicts Vision as an android attempting to come to grips with the world, while Elizabeth Olsen gets to further explore the character of Scarlet Witch, sharing some really great scenes with Bettany. William Hurt makes a welcome return to the MCU as Thunderbolt Ross, now Secretary of State. This approach seems to be done as a way to still make clear that The Incredible Hulk (the black sheep of the MCU) is still part of the universe. Hurt shows Ross as a complicated politician. Frank Grillo makes a great, small appearance as Rumlow at the beginning, while Emily VanCamp makes a welcome return as Sharon Carter and Martin Freeman is introduced to the MCU in a small role as Everett Ross, who will undoubtedly return for future installments. The real standouts in the film are Tom Holland as Spider-Man and Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther. Holland steals the scenes that he is in as Spider-Man, working exceptionally well opposite Evans and Downey, as well as Marisa Tomei, who depicts Aunt May. Holland is comedic, depicting the character as a nervous, geeky, unsure character. Holland seems to be the definitive version of the character, delivering a far better performance of the character than Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, the two of whom are also fine actors. While some may say that Spider-Man is only featured in the film to introduce him into the MCU and also to setup the planned standalone film, I believe that Spider-Man worked out well in the film and lend a real sense of stamina to the film, especially the big fight. Boseman is amazing as Black Panther, delivering the character with menace and true purpose. Boseman is calm as the character, while the introduction is wild and spectacular. Daniel Bruhl makes a great appearance as the villain Zemo, who has a huge connection to the events of the film. While the character is different in the comic books, I can defend the change that had to be done, since it supports the film's plot and layout. Bruhl's approach to the character, as a calm and calculating villain, as well as the villain itself is spectacular, while he has got to be the best villain that the universe has had to see so far. The idea of having a normal, regular human face off against the Avengers is smart and total genius on the part of the filmmakers. The end result is films that will leave the viewer wondering how the universe will continue. Since Captain America: The Winter Soldier acted as a turning point in the MCU leading up to Age of Ultron, this film does the same, showing a change in Stark, while also showing Rogers as a new leader. The film ends in such a way with us wondering the directions that the characters will go in and also if Stark will ever be needed anymore, while also showing the lengths that he can go to. The film includes a number of good references to other films in the MCU, while it also acts as a terrific conclusion to the Captain America trilogy, proving that this is the best trilogy within the MCU. In the case of good third chapters in trilogies (Toy Story 3, The Dark Knight Rises, Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King) this film acts a fantastic third chapter to its own trilogy. The film also does the smart move of not revolving around a huge battle, showing the slow build up to the battle and the lengths that characters can go to, in a way showing a war of opinions in political style discussion. The result is a film that is terrific and well-handled, acting as a great comic book film, but also so far as this year's best comic book film.

Spiderman is stronger and faster than Captain America, not to mention the fact that Spiderman is intellectually gifted and bright in the likes of genius kids in league with the likes of Tony Stark. The main reason why Spiderman beats Captain America though is because Spiderman can dodge bullets. He can also see and sense blows miles away before they touch his body, not to mention that he senses danger even before the attack happens. The only way to hurt Spiderman is to distract him in the havoc and chaos created, with innocent bystanders or what not, while Cap has to hide behind his shield. Captain America had difficulties fighting the Winter Soldier while Spiderman defeated the Winter Soldier and Falcon at the same time? it all speaks volume of favoritism for branding and marketing purposes rather than staying true to the Marvel Characters integrity. Spiderman is also tactical and he always subdues all his opponents by using his wits and intelligence rather than hurting them, always finding it more preferable although he is more than capable of going rounds blow for blow with some Powerful Beings. Captain Americas strength, endurance and stamina is mediocre in comparison with Spiderman too.

","...the underlying theme is the clash between American exceptionalism (we know best and we'll do what we want, when and where we want) and, on the other side, responsibility to the people and the rule of law, both nationally and internationally. And unfortunately the writers appear to have opted for the plot to make the former appear to be the correct attitude, in compliance with the US Republican Party agenda. I believe that is why so many people were profoundly disappointed with this film, despite the opportunity to see their favourite superheroes in action again.
It actually started out on a positive note, reminding people that combating the bad guys should try to take into consideration the citizens they're there to protect and to avoid all the mayhem that has so far been written off as unfortunate collateral damage (too bad, sniff, tear). Remember how Hancock was told: you can't go around doing things like that! And the last time 'that' meant a city being dropped from a considerable height.
Not only does that sort of thing cause serious loss of life - remember the role to 'protect humanity', not spin another sequel (if these films are to have any relevance to humanity beyond simple escapism) - but it also has other consequences, like sparking resentment and a desire for revenge.

Nonetheless, after 2015's bland Avengers sequel I was a little apprehensive about the quality that would be presented in Civil War, these concerns were soon forgotten about. With the Russo Brothers at the helm, as expected, Civil War is essentially a hybrid of previous films; The Avengers and Winter Soldier. The action scenes are grounded in a contextual reality that is reminiscent of Winter Soldier but incorporates the ensemble cast with a fluidity similar to the Avengers Assemble. The finished product is an extremely well balanced action film that keeps your attention from beginning to end and considering this is Marvel's longest film to date, it achieves this with a certain sense of passivity. The film is proficient at preserving the relationships that it has established throughout it's predecessors while harmlessly introducing MCU newbies Black Panther and Spiderman. The casting of these two characters is impeccable and I eagerly await the solo films that will ensue. Any criticisms that arise throughout the film are of the nitpicking variety and mostly consist of some convenient plot points and the occasional flat scene.

You know i look it in 3D and in every punch, the camera rotates 2-3 times my eyes get tired, and i became eye cancer.. No soundtrack or anything else what can you cheer up at fighting only to much superheros who they try to make their power in balance... standing 6 vs 6 in a row and with the ""ding ding ding"" they run at each other ... you know they compares it with BvS i saw that too 2 months ago and i can remember every fight scene and there was epic moments (like ""Do you bleed"" and all the other battle quotes) but here .. i cannot, the only flop's in the film is Spiderman and Black panther, and I'm a Black panther fan, Spiderman was very good, but all the others shouldn't be in the film, there was too much and it was not a ""Be"" for all them, you can explain the storyline in 20 seconds and i couldn't stand it in the theater... i even forget a time that there was a villain, and they say ""great moves"" and other things... nah, widow again with his leg around neck turning back flip moves what we see in every films she appears a 20 time, vision at the fight with only two lame laser shots, you know when you saw deadpool you cant laugh at the little jokes in here, the travel and the place switches they couldn't do it,captain fights at Africa a time 2 seconds later he is in a funeral ... you know, are my expectations to high?i don't know, the only thing i can remember panther, winter and capt. Can run faster than vehicles and twice then usain bolt sry marvel fans I'm a big comic book-film fan but this was not what we need ..",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

Bucky Barnes is a ""Manchurian Candidate"", both Capt. Steve Rogers ""sidekick"" and a terrible assassin. It turns out than he killed Tony Stark's parents while under Russian or Hydra control.

Now will somebody please explain to me how the ""mortal-but-enhanced"" beings keep from getting wounded or dying, like The Black Panther? I suspect that Natasha Romanoff is a female-Russian version of the Captain and pretty-much indestructible. Pretty much non-stop CGI between long stretches of dialog. A terrible and sad ending. Heroes are broken, on-the-mend, or imprisoned. It's all for the revenge of one man for the death of his family during one of the Avengers ""rampages"" in Eastern Europe. Bucky Barnes goes back in ""cold storage"" as he can't resolve the guilt from all the murders his alter-ego committed. Not for repeat viewing by me. I didn't like it at all.

",i m gonna say i liked this movie. there are some very major faults in this movie that's makes this just another entertainer only in action sequences. The action in this movie is damn good and because of that other faults minimizes. Strating at the movie at Africa where the Avengers stops a biochemical attack Scarlet witch just controlled the chemical gas by her witch thing at throw it high in the air!!! and save every one in the ground!!! what the hell was that.. its still in the air witch!! But i like her she is awesome. The Airport Fight scene was awesome just awesome but hey here it comes.. there is a scene when vision flew into ant-man passed through him and can see captain and bucky running to the jet to flee and he can clearly see the jet but he decided to blew up the nearby tower.. What Really?? That is the thing first time catches my eyes in theaters. Spider man and ant-man is the best thing happened in this movie.. Black panther is great with some cheesy lines. Comes to main Villain Marvels Just pooped again i mean come on. how can he know that Tony and captain and bucky is going to be there in that place alone to watch that video. Its just unreal. He just go there and think that tony is going to use his iphone 99 and find out that he killed the the man who's appointed to question bucky and gonna get to that place and black panther following him come on where from did he follows him and what is he thinking that tony is going to meet captain. I mean this is just epically logic-less. Although with these flaws u r end up liking this movie because you like them i like them and the actions made you to like this movie. Its absolutely a pretty average movie for me with superhero awesome fights.. Russo Brothers Directed this who is gonna direct infinity war with more heroes in it which made me thinking that is gonna be another this kind of just cool action sequence film.

","Captain America Civil War (2016) : Well almost all superhero movies deal with some super villain trying to conquer world and our heroes stop them.Those movies only depend on VFX but no plot.But some superhero movies break these stereotypes by making different attempt. For example Batman series by Nolan and Captain America Winter Soldier.Winter soldier is kind of a political thriller than superhuman. So I eagerly waited for Civil War as its Cap Vs Iron Man war. Plot: With many people fearing the actions of super heroes, the government decides to push for the Hero Registration Act, a law that limits a hero's actions. This results in a division in The Avengers. Iron Man stands with this Act, claiming that their actions must be kept in check otherwise cities will continue to be destroyed, but Captain America feels that saving the world is daring enough and that they cannot rely on the government to protect the world. This escalates into an all- out war between Team Iron Man (Iron Man, Black Panther, Vision, Black Widow, War Machine, and Spiderman) and Team Captain America (Captain America, Bucky Barnes, Falcon, Sharon Carter, Scarlett Witch, Hawkeye, and Ant Man) while a new villain emerges. Plus Points: 1)Story: Well this movie do not have any super powered Villain but it deals with ego conflicts between our own Avengers.When Iron man accepts the new Act and Captain disapproves it,there starts a war.We cant chose a particular side among them because they all sound right.Both the teams intentions are good. 2)Screenplay: As I said it has good screenplay which can keep us glued to screen with new twists and hero entries.The way they introduced Spidey and Ant Man are awesome.If you are just an action lover you may enjoy only those but if you are a true movie buff you will love it. 3)Action scenes and VFX: They are just spectacular with brilliant VFX .The chase between Captain America,Winter Soldier and Black Panther in first half and the fight scene between both teams in second half are marvelous.Even the blend of humor is a huge asset for this movie. Spidey and Ant Man gave us great laughs. 4)Performances: Well as we are watching them in their roles in lot of movies we cannot describe their ability again.But Spiderman got a new actor Holland but his look should be maintained well. Minus Points: 1)Duration: Movie's duration is 2hr 30min long so some may feel bored and to those who hate more conversation and less action movies they may not like this movie much.

This feels like an epic film, but unfortunately it is not. The best action part of the film comes at this point: the famous airport scene! It could have been much better, but still great! Recently, some super hero movies have started to inspire from ""Empire Strikes Back"" and this movie is one of them. It tries to be dark and epic like ""ESB"". Crossbones was a disappointment as a cameo, the other villain is pretty interesting though. The opening sequence of the movie which recalls ""Expendables"" movies are fun, but no more than that. The meetings among the heroes to discuss the subjects are key points of the film and very interesting to listen, but it could have been deeper, darker and longer. There is a few moments of an avenger in the middle of the movie and it is pretty touching indeed, Russo Brothers can touch your heart which is a plus, but again, the movie could have been much more touching and also intense. Black Panther is perfect! He is the star of the movie like Bucky in ""The Winter Soldier."" The chase scene is one of the bests in Marvel history. The shoots are jaw dropping! The battle between Cap and Stark which is the main focus of the story is fairly done and technically masterful, but it feels rushed. It is not brilliant or unforgettable, but touching and impressive! Iron Man is not too powerful in this movie which is an improvement (realistic) By the way, I was very impressed by the strong friendship between Steve and Bucky. ""Civil War"" is not epic or action packed, but it is very good. Spider- Man here is hilarious here and it is not a disappointment. I just didn't like his new ""camera"" eyes. Also, I don't like these frequent casting changes, but every new change means a new chance. As for Aunt May, a bold choice, but it was OK. All the other heroes do their part without question. For War Machine, I prefer Terrence Howard, but Cheadle is OK, too. Black Panther is cool, but too assertive and too self confident, but the character was extremely impressive. ""Captain America: Civil War"" is a very good and strong super hero movie, but it could have been better. I prefer ""The Winter Soldier"" over ""Civil War.""",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

","After the rousing success of 2014's ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"" which strived to redefine a problematic superhero in a post-""Avengers"" landscape, Marvel Studios sustains the introspective atmosphere for ""Captain America: Civil War,"" expanding on ideas of heroism and responsibility as the Marvel Cinematic Universe expands and costumed crime-fighting becomes ubiquitous in fictional realms and at the local multiplex. Returning directors Anthony and Joe Russo know exactly how to play these characters, building on the ""Winter Soldier"" success through community inspection while still making time for bulldozing action sequences. Captain America remains the focal point of the movie, but his place as a symbol for freedom feeds into a larger appreciation of heightened abilities and tech, and all the confusion it creates in a paranoid world.

","This film is without a doubt Marvel's best film yet. First, let's applaud the writers here because they took a story and adapted it as best as they could to tie it into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and they were able to do that without tarnishing the story. That right there is fantastic writing. That is spectacular writing and something Warner Bros. and DC could take a page from. This is one of the reason's Marvel movies are so popular because they bring to life a story and characters while keeping both of those faithful to the original creation. Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. were perfect for their roles. Everyone was perfect for their roles. This is cast who not only understands their characters, but they also understand the character dynamics not just in the story but also regarding each other, and they are friends. Everyone here is friends with someone else, and it is believable not just because they are friends in real like but also because they have such great chemistry with one another.

747,7 June 2016,KineticSeoul,9," My second favorite Marvel movie so far.
","Despite this film not being bigger with more connections and wider variety of superheroes fighting a war. A war that is driven by more tension and inner turmoil in a more devastating circumstances. However I can sort of understand why it went in a direction where the superheroes pulled their punches. Because they wanted to go in a more lighthearted approach with more fun and some humor thrown in. For a title like ""Civil War"" it didn't really have lot at stake although it deals with a important decision the team has to make from the inside. It seemed more like a battle than a actual war. I did like the messages behind the plot of this movie and it does have few emotional scenes, especially near the end. So when it comes to touching base with elements that make a superheroes movie fun, it did the job close to perfection. With so many superhero movies out there I wanted something new and for the most part, this was a refreshing experience with well cinematography and choreography when it comes down to the hand to hand fighting parts. I thought I was going to prefer ""BvS"" over ""Civil War"". But I ended up liking both equally. I think ""Civil War"" has a more integral set up when it comes to two different ideologies, perspectives that deals with politics and inner emotions colliding. And ""Civil War"" has more action and hand to hand combat sequences which I enjoyed watching on screen. Plus it has my favorite interpretation of Spider-Man in it. Tobey Maguire was alright playing the role as the web slinger, but came off way too emotional and whinny at times. And came off more girly than the female leads during few scenes, despite him being a likable nerd. Don't get me started on ""Spider-Man 3"". I think Andrew Garfield did a okay job as Peter Parker, but wasn't all that likable. Peter Parker in this reminded me of a 16 year old verson of Pavel Chekov from the rebooted Star Trek movies. Except he makes witty comments and movie references to taunt his opponents like what Spidey does in the comics and animated shows. Anyways I also liked the way it portrayed the two team leaders, showing the heart and will power of Captain America despite his traumatic past and the loss of his loved ones. Also his experience with Hydra and Shield. Than there is the charismatic but broken Tony Stark who is driven by guilt and regrets. While one is a populist the other is a elitist, so it was engaging when things went down.

In the end, it was fun but not challenging. Seriously, at some points I was actually calling things before they happened. And at this point I thought they had learned to stop making it seem like something's gonna happen and then they back pedal from it, like they're not willing to take risks in the story to make you go ""wow, I can't believe they went there."" And in the end all kinda falls flat, like all the development and tense build up lead to nothing big.

I feel very similarly about this movie as I did about The Last Jedi: both exciting movies you're super engaged the entire time, but many character decisions leave you scratching your head. In Civil War, it seemed like a disproportionate amount of the conflict was driven purely by revenge, which seemed simplistic for such brilliant and nuanced people like Stark. The full-on Avengers battle seemed a bit unrealistic to me in how all the characters accepted it as inevitable, and as always in these movies, the action scenes seem super unrealistic in how resilient the main characters are and how weak the generic soldiers are.

752,5 May 2016,athena-no-sainto,," A Brilliant script with ups and downs in the rhythm
","Besides The First ""The Avengers"" movie, the first two Captain America films have been the only Marvel movies that I really fully enjoyed, I also liked the Iron Man trilogy, but always left me the feeling that they could have been much better. Civil War is probably the most ambitious project in the Marvel Universe reuniting many of the best characters of the comic books in one film ,adapting one of the most interesting comic sagas of the last years. Civil War has many virtues but also many defects, its greatest virtue is its very good and intelligent script that has a surprising final twist at the end that resolves the plot perfectly, but I did't enjoy the narrative structure in which the script was executed, with abrupt changes of rhythm that decreases the pace of the story. The three acts of the film feels like if they were three different movies and the action sequences in the first act of the film were awfully shot, with crazy camera movements that don't allow to see what is happening on the screen and even they made me feel dizzy but fortunately in the second and third act this seems to get better and luckily the battle between the Main Characters was shot in a more decent way . The tone of the film in the first act and the third are different than in second, the first act and the third have a very serious tone but the second act changes drastically, with more humour and adding many of the lame jokes that marvel use to put in their productions that luckily were funnier than in other movies. The film also introduces new characters of the Marvel universe, Black Panther, looks amazing, although that with all those stupid camera movements in the action scenes you can't distinguish between a punch or a kick or whatever they are doing during the fights Emoticono tongue and also introduces to the new Spiderman, who as Spiderman looks pretty good but as Peter Parker I think they choose an extremely young actor and Marisa Tomei (an actress that I love) playing a hot an extremely young Aunt May did't convince me neither . Awful action sequences,, very fun and enjoyable battle between the heroes of the Marvel universe, Awesome Black Panther, Downey Jr being awesome, Spiderkid and the hottest Aunt May that you could ever imagine Emoticono tongue and an excellent script with ups and downs in the rhythm of the story but above all, one of the most enjoyable films in the Marvel cinematic universe",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

","I'll just point out every good things in this movie by listing them 1. How Chris Evans brings Cap to life always just blows me away, he gets better and better with every movie 2. The chase scene which involves Bucky, Cap and Black Panther is definitely better than the trailer. 3. Chadwick Boseman is T'Challa; strong, tough, resilient and a king material and also a man with a few words 4. Spider-Man.....what can I say Marvel Studios, you just created the best and most entertaining Spider-Man, good job. I didn't hate the 2 former modern Spider-Man, but really just none of them has ever gotten the Spider-Man feel as Tom Holland did. 5. The airport fighting scenes were absurdly unbelievable....in a good way. It is not the epic fight as it was in the comics, no....and if you're expecting that then I guess you just don't know how to appreciate these people in bringing these characters to life. 6. I can see the spark between the distracted Vision and Scarlet Witch portrayed very well. What's amazing though is how this movie can picture the beginning of their love between in all this mess. 7. Daniel Bruhl as Baron Zemo; he just seriously exceeded my expectations. A typical Cap villain, well done. There are reasons why I gave this a 8/10 1. Iron Man's team is too OP, I mean you have Vision, Spider-Man, Black Panther and Iron Man himself. Maybe it was for plot reasons, but I can't even imagine Iron Man and his team losing 2. What is supposed to be Crossbones role here? I mean sure, Wanda killed him with dozen other innocents killed in collateral damage...there are thousand others killed in Sokovia, and the one in Lagos is the one that broke the camel's back? I'm sorry I just don't see it 3. Vision is way too weak here, I mean this is the first Vision right? Not the Young Avengers Vision. 4. The end was surprisingly weak, I was probably expecting Cap to die for some reason or maybe heavily injured that he cannot fight anymore, I thought Crossbones would be the one to do him in. 5. Lastly, Cap almost signed the SHRA!!! WTF Marvel?!!! What's more absurd is what's coming after, he then rejected the offer because Wanda is locked up....in Stark's luxurious apartment!!! Okay, I'm not expecting a straight off-comic movie....but I just can't see the reason to call this a Civil War because what makes a Civil War is the difference in principles between two sides which is: what is right, and what is legal, and guess what....Cap and Stark did make up for a while before his parents problem kicked in again.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016
757,25 April 2018,jade-howells,4," Conflict for the sake of conflict
","Marvel has shown it can make movies that, while formulaic, can still be enjoyable. Guardians of the Galaxy was a fun romp, as was Thor Ragnarok. Even the more serious toned ones such as Winter Soldier I got a kick out of. Civil War however, I detest. I'll start off with the only thing I liked: Spider-Man. He was fun to see on screen and had a good presence overall. 
Apart from that, this movie has the standard cliches that have come to adorn every Marvel movie such as underdeveloped villains and fight scenes every 30 minutes that have no stakes since you know it doesn't affect anything, but Civil War goes the extra mile by having a plot that could be resolved within the first five minutes if anyone bothered to talk to one another. The entire movie would be rendered moot if Steve went up to Tony and said ""Hey, Bucky has been brainwashed by HYDRA so everyone he killed wasn't his choice. he also killed your parents. How about we try to deprogram him instead of lock him away where any Randy can apparently just break in a top secret government facility and trigger him to kill, so this never happens again."" but alas, we wouldn't have a movie. Also, how does anyone blame the Avengers for the conflict that happened in Avengers or Winter Soldier? like the Age of Ultron conflict can be pinned on Tony sure, cause he made Ultron, but this movie seriously tries to tell you that giant space aliens and nazis showing up is the Avengers fault somehow, as a result of Iron Man being around. I'm pretty sure Loki and HYDRA would have still done their plan regardless of the Avengers being around or not. The entire ""debate"" about the whether the Avengers should be controlled by the government or not becomes completely one sided when Winter Soldier and this very movie prove that they absolutely should not be. When you have a movie universe where government facilities can be infiltrated by any Randy on the street (as the villain of this movie is literally just some guy who does that exact thing because his family died, with no help at all), and who also do nothing at all, then handing 'roided up super soldiers, metal suits that can kill anything, and psychics all on a silver platter is moronic. Don't pretend to have a debate when there isn't one in sight. 
Onto the average, the CGI is what you come to expect from Marvel; not horrendous, but at the same time not great, anything CGI doesn't have a real presence on screen. The acting is fine, the direction is plain and could have been done by anyone, cinematography is average, editing is average, fight scene choreography is the same from any standard movie and there's a cut almost every second to try and hide how lazy it is (a shame especially since there are so many fight scenes you think they would put some effort into it). I honestly enjoyed Suicide Squad more, because while that is even worse than this movie, more entertainment can be drawn from Jared Leto and the rest of the cringe crew from laughing at how bad the movie is.
I give this a 4/10 for being a movie pumped out from the factory line with no care, heart, or creativity involved, only the sense that you're watching an ad for Spider-Man and Black Panther.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

","Way back when this film was announced in 2014 I was both exited an worried. Worried that the film would be one sided and that Iron Man would be painted as a villain. Well that worry was ill founded. Captain America Civil War is the BEST movie in the MCU. Anthony Mackie said the acting in this film is on point, and it truly is. All the actors pull off amazing performances. Although everyone was amazing RDJ killed it again as Iron Man amazing performance. Now Tom Holland as Spiderman, sorry for the cheesy pun but he was AMAZING. I was grinning ear to ear every moment he was on screen, he truly is the best Spiderman. And Black Panther as well brilliant, amazing performance from Chadwick Boseman. The action is brilliant! The airport scene was the best scene amazing action. Spiderman was running his mouth through the entire fight typical Spidey. The story was brilliant as well. Both Iron Man and Cap are given good justifications as to why they are fighting. Now the movie isn't without it's problems (but what movie is?) Baron Zemo. I really didn't like this, Marvel villains are typically weak characters but this Zemo is a sympathetic villain. Zemo should be true evil for the sake of it not out of sympathy. Another thing is that nobody dies! In all of the Marvel movies characters rarely die and you don't really feel the stakes were high. Here they should have been higher than ever and this should have been shown by somebody biting the dust. I would of liked to see more Spiderman but I realise they got the wall crawler late in the game. I was worried about the ending but it was done very well. If your'3 worried about this being too bias for Cap as I was don't be, despite the name this is really an Avengers film and is truly the best film in the MCU. 10/10",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

Anyway, as the accords are about to be signed, a terrorist bomb demolishes the building where the meeting is being held. Captain America and his allies go after the villain, and Iron Man and his allies try to take them down. Because the UN would totally not care about stopping whoever tried to blow up their meeting.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

I have two (no, three) problems with this one: 1) the fight CGI (UNLIKE The Avengers) was way too fast to follow, it just looks too hokey; 2) the movie was about 20 minutes too long, there's a fair amount of chaff to get through before the civil war; and 3) the plot was just a little too complicated. Oh, and 4) Vision is too powerful to be in this mix. On the plus side Spidey was done very well, the circumstances that lead to superhero vs. superhero were believable (if a tad complicated), and as usual Marvel is spot on in their casting of the new roles.

","Action-packed, humorous, well balanced and well acted; Captain America Civil War is another insanely good addition to the MCU courtesy of Winter Soldier directors, the Russo Brothers. With a hero cast that greatly outnumbered any of its predecessor, one of the highlights of this battle of the titans was the inclusion of two new MCU characters, namely Tom Holland's Spider-Man and Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther; who in many ways stole the show. Credit must be given to the full team-up confrontation choreographed in the airport scene briefly depicted in the trailers, which without a doubt introduced us to a gladiator match like never seen before. With plot twists that will divide fans and general viewers alike, Civil War inspires us to seriously consider how the events leading up to this mammoth conflict have drastically transformed some of our biggest and favourite MCU character, building primarily upon the events that occurred in both the Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron. Identifying weaknesses were minimal as the movie manages to reconcile what was maybe a very fast paced and almost confusing first half with a momentous and emotionally driven finale which justified the need for thorough detail in the beginning. While the film tingled my nerd senses throughout, delivering just about all that I had dreamed of witnessing on the big screen pre-release, I give this title a 9 and only a 9 (I wouldn't of given it quite a 9.5 if it has been an option) was the noticeable structural weaknesses in the first hour in terms of pacing, but also the ever so slightly under-whelming opening act which saw the new Avengers team taking on one of their first big threats. My own personal highlights in terms of specific characters in the movie would go to both Cap and Ironman, but also the short but amazingly sweet appearances of both Tom Holland's Spider-Man and Paul Rudd's Ant-Man.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

To be honest this is how BvS should have been. I like DC universe more than marvel. But I like Marvel movies because it entertains and MCU took the comic book adapted movies to another level. It hit the right notes and the right mix of the emotions really work for the movie. BvS didn't quite get it right. Civil war is supposed to be a serious dark movie and one of the best Marvel comics have to offer (Seems like marvel is concentrating on movies and left comics for dead. The quality of marvel comics dipped recently, DC too but the Injustice is really good). But it fulfills the latter part only. It does have some negatives like some poor CGI shots, Average villain and sometimes the comedy ruins serious scenes. But it got too many elements that work, like the climax, spider-man, black panther, the rivalry and ending credits (oh yeah). Will it entertain you- HELL yes.

It continued to deliver the story like Winter Soldier did: Easy to understand, but full of surprises and elements that can make the difference( The video that showed how Tony's parents were murdered, the weird red notebook of Hydra,...).This plot is way better than that of Batman v Superman( Sorry, DC fans, but that movie sucks). More impressive, Civil War's story line had a bunch of characters, but the way each appeared didn't mess the movie up, they only make the movie better. And finally, the action sequences. They were stunning! I loved the battle scene at the airport, especially when Ant-man enlarged or Spider-man showing off his amazing skills).

There are a few rare exceptions of course, like Captain America: Civil War for instance. After the disastrous Batman vs Superman that left a bitter aftertaste, time had come for something more refreshing and engaging, and I must say that Captain America Civil War delivers the goods. It has everything one would expect from a movie...dynamic superheroes with awesome abilities, story, momentum, and the question we ask as to what happens next, which keeps our attention on the big screen. I watched this in the theater and not a soul stirred during the 2.5 hour duration of the movie. All the characters in this movie played out their roles with precision and realism. The fight scenes are excellent (at times funny) as each superhero is matched up against someone else but the seriousness of the fight scenes builds to a crescendo which leaves us with a very satisfying climax to the movie. I have seen most of the Marvel movies in recent years but this by far is one of the best superhero movies ever. You might want to watch Captain America: The Winter Soldier again as this is somewhat of a continuation of where that movie left us off.

815,29 April 2016,thechair,9," This is how to do it, DC!
","If you see someone with a sad face coming out of Captain America: Civil War (2016; 147 mins), sidle over and whisper, ""Are you a Warner Bros/DC executive?"" If they answer 'yes' just be kind. I'd rather bathe in stinging nettles and marmots than have that feeling. Marvel, Joe & Anthony Russo, and to some extent Robert Downey Jnr and Chris Evans, have pitted against each other two lesser characters (objectively speaking) than Zach Snyder's wasted gold dust and there isn't even a competition about which is the better film. Because yes, Civil War is as good as you may have heard. No, actually, it's even better than that. Where the recent DC films have struggled with consequences of actions, this is a film all about them. Some examples: if you open with a virtuoso action sequence that thrills and entertains without flaw then you're going to have to escalate throughout the film. Check. If you have too many heroes on your hands then you're going to have to write a brilliant script that introduces/involves/evolves them all in a significant way, so that the audience doesn't wonder why they're there. Done. And if you've done all this successfully before then you're going to have to do better. Mission accomplished. What Marvel have been especially good at is finding the right balance between humour and action, between levity and high stakes. In Civil War they have reached the apotheosis of this alchemy. The moments of tragedy and pathos that come from conflict between friends, not to mention other developments, mingle effortlessly with those of genuine hilarity, from all comers. It makes for a ridiculously entertaining mix. Similarly, the balance between action and dialogue scenes is pretty much perfect. When they come, the energy and sheer inventiveness of the former makes for a spectacle that never, ever gets boring. Each set piece utilises a completely different style and the ideas just never stop, with one particular motorcycle trick inducing gasps and cheers from the audience. The latter, the story, the personal conflicts, are superbly scripted and played out, and they ground the movie in something real. Civil War is fun, pretty much non-stop, but it is a long way from silly. There are serious matters afoot and the 'bits in between' are as gripping as the action because so much attention has been paid to each word, each glance. The cast, as usual, are exemplary, and we get bigger and better turns from Paul Bettany (The Vision) and Elizabeth Olsen (Scarlet Witch), while the introduction of Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther and a certain web-crawler brings even more to the party, and without diluting the mix. Special mentions, though, to Chris Evans (Cap) and Ben Barnes (Winter Soldier) who do a lot of heavy dramatic lifting; another one to Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow) because, well, I don't need a reason (she's excellent, though); but the big bucks do go to Downey Jnr, who is the best he has ever been as ol' Shellhead.

","So write of the bat, this is great movie. Not just in terms of being a comic book movie but just a movie. It is a well balanced combination of action and humor all the while hitting all the right emotional beats. It manages to introduce two new amazing characters in a very short amount of time but neither feels rushed or forced. This movie seems to be getting a lot of flake for the 'near obsession level of devotion',as one reviewer put it, that Steve rogers shows for bucky. And I couldn't disagree more, Steve and bucky are like brothers so as anyone with siblings knows just how deep that emotional bond runs. Steve might not agree with everything bucky does or how he does it but at the end of the day YOU are allowed to be mad at your siblings or disagree with them but if someone else does it then you have their backs. It is the basic code of sibling hood, aside from 'don't tell mom the stupid stuff I did'. Besides since the Avengers we have seen how out-place Cap really feels in this world ( the I understand that moments or the little book of look stuff up or pretty much any conversation he has with black widow in the first half of Winter soldier). So it makes perfect sense for him to latch on the last remaining link he has of his previous life especially since (SPOILERS) Peggy Carter is now dead.

Black Widow disappears with only the explanation of Ross is coming to get her. I mean she's hot but come on she's super spy they could've done a lot more than that. Hawkeye is on Team Cap/the fugitive side which doesn't make sense because if he was truly thinking about his Family, he would've been on Iron Man's side. Falcon dodging The Vision's attack as if he got spider-sense yet War Machine couldn't detect that. Iron Man could've catch up to the Quinjet if he truly tried. Spider-Man? Spider-Boy. That's all their is to say about him. One thing though, Aunt May is too young. She looks like mid 30-mid 40's. Vision could've single-handily take out Cap and Winter Soldier without a sweat. But for some reason as with Thor, Marvel decided to make them weaker than they should be. There was no need for Crossbone's appearance. They only placed him their for 1. ""Bucky"" 2. Scarlet Witch's disaster. For number 1, they could've done something else, something much better that wasting a villain like that. Number 2, after New York and Sokovia, the Government of the world took action for that? And where in the world is Nick Fury? He was the one who started the whole Avengers thing yet he's no where to be found and wasn't even mentioned. A lot of inconsistency and bad story building. Worst thing that bothers be is this is supposed to be a war. A ""War"". Didn't feel like it to me and every little chance they get, they pop out a joke.

","Captain America: Civil War was free to watch with Amazon Prime. I figured it would be worth a watch even though Super Hero movies are a real hit or miss. Many people love Marvel movies because they are bright, funny, and filled with action. Great examples of this are Deadpool and Iron Man. Unfortunately, I turned this movie off after 10 minutes. Someone please explain to me how a bunch of super heroes need Black Widow. This was part of the problem with the original Avenger's movie: You have Space Aliens with laser cannons and flying ships and we're going to send in a 125lbs woman in leather to shoot at them with a 9mm in between kicks. IT makes no sense. What's even worse is that they can make scenes with the hulk smashing cities and fighting an Iron Man Suit, but they can't have the Black widow balance enough to actually produce force in a kick or punch. It looks stupid. Not as stupid as Falcon's wings, but stupid enough to turn the movie off. Sorry Marvel fans, You have a Plethora of amazing Marvel Characters who could replace the Black widow. Too bad the studio feels it needs to keep trotting out the same illogical character choices. (BTW, Black widow is a spy and does great at infiltration.

","Essentially a third 'Avengers' film, 'Captain America: Civil War (2016)' easily ranks amongst the very best of the 'MCU' primarily because it's so breathlessly entertaining and effortlessly character-focused, featuring an eclectic set of charismatic characters caught on two sides of a captivating moral dilemma that has no clear 'right' or 'wrong'. It has an almost pitch-perfect tone, being serious without being gloomy, dark without being dour and having lasting consequences (both for this film and for the 'cinematic universe' at large). Having both the protagonist and antagonist be 'heroes' is a ballsy move but it pays off remarkably well. It leads to a thematically-rich experience that's much more nuanced than, perhaps, is usual with the genre. On top of all that, the flick brilliantly balances being, essentially, both a direct sequel to 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)' and 'Avengers: Age Of Ultron (2015)', tying together themes and character motivations from both to further the feeling that these past events have shaped pretty much every core player's perspective. Where they side on the central debate feels wholly cohesive with their character, which is kept firmly at the heart of the feature, and this leads to tangible motivations that constantly drive every single decision. This is what really makes all the action feel palpable, as well as the fantastic stunt-work and restrained CG-integration. Our heroes aren't fighting nameless thugs, they're fighting their friends and it hurts. Yet, everyone thinks they're doing the right thing. Because of this, the non-universe-ending stakes are all the more impactful. It's really remarkable. It's also really emotionally affecting, especially when the subversive climax rolls around. 9/10",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

The story is good, the pacing is a little slow but the action scenes are as good as they have ever been.

Wow, I didn't expect this movie to be very good at all, and for once I fell like the fanboys are right and my expectations were wrong. I mean it's got well shot action, it's got Spider-Man, it's got decent character development, it's got Spider-Man, and did I mention it's got Spider-Man? I mean first off this movie does the little things correctly (for the most part), it has action scenes that you can tell what's going on (except for when they have to hide Scar-Joe's body double with shaky cam when doing some of her fight scenes), Chris Hemsworth seems to do most of his own stunts, and overall the fight scenes are very creative and action-packed. The superhero scene with every hero coming together for their big showdown is freaking amazing. Like besides the fact vision doesn't seem to do much of anything and doesn't even chase down Captain America once he starts to escape, every hero seems to be constantly doing something off-screen as well as using their powers in new and interesting ways on screen. The score for this movie is very well done, maybe not original but it's there when it needs to be, accentuates moments that it needs to, and shuts up when it shouldn't be there. The humor is toned down but still there, and besides some missed jokes from ant-man (and some from Spidey sadly) this movie still manages to be hilarious and the comedy is actually well timed for once. Overall the story and the writing for this movie are well above average. I loved black panther and spider man and their respective introductions. I thought the villains motivations were actually really unique, which made for one of the best superhero movie twists since watchmen. Yeah Iron Man is an asshole, and Captain America is pretty obviously right after you get into about an hour through the movie, but so what. The characters seem to stay true to themselves and I appreciate that.

Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans show one more time that they were born to be play Captain America and Iron Man. But who really stole the show was Black Panther and Spider-Man. Marvel chose the perfect actor to portray the great king of Wakanda. But who really was the cherry on the cake was what Tom Holland. This guy is the perfect Peter Parker and Spider-Man with his great humor, which all fans were waiting. Anyway This film is a masterpiece, thanks to the Brothers Russo, now we can say that Avengers Infinity War part 1 and 2 is in good hands.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

","-SPOILERS BY THE WAY- How this movie managed to both live up to the hype and surpass it is beyond me, but it did both. Before yesterday, my favorite movie was Christopher Nolan's Inception, but it looks like Marvel's Civil War has managed to take the cake. While subliminally, it seems Marvel has been setting up this film for a long time. Whenever Tony Stark and Steve Rogers meet on screen, there's usually some argument or tension. The Sokovia Accords was the end to the time bomb. At first I was afraid that some characters wouldn't get enough screen time. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how the Russos managed to juggle ten heroes while adding two new ones. Tom Holland's Spider Man is the best by far, but Black Panther was definitely the more interesting character. I'm excited for both solo films to come out. I'm surprised at how many people disliked Zemo. You may have to watch the film multiple times to realize it, but he's a fantastic character. He's driven by a thirst for revenge after the Avengers inadvertently killed his father, son, and wife. And what better way to tear them apart then to show Tony who killed his parents. The airport battle scene was amazing, but the friend-on-friend action at the end really took the cake for me. Bucky losing his metal arm, Tony's armor being demolished, and Steve dropping his shield were all very good emotional conveyors. Not to mention, while this is happening, T'Chala stops Zemo from committing suicide. It's dark, dark stuff, but it's shown in a way that Batman V Superman could never pull off. 10/10",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

If you were to ask me to rate the comic book movies of all time I'd put Dark knight in number 1 position and rest of the comic book movies at number 2 position. But after watching Civil war, I'm changing my list a little. Captain America civil war to be included in number 1 position along with Dark knight and rest of the comic book movies at number 2. Reason, why? Well you gotta watch the movie to understand. Antman and Spiderman steals the show with ease. Every frame where they appear is simply awesome. Black Panther character is highly justified with almost near identical costume as how he appears in comics and Boseman's Panther steals the show. Giant man does appear in movie but why he becomes a giANT man, sorry guys, can't spoil that. Wait till the end of the movie to catch the glimpse of homecoming.

","Review: I must admit, I wasn't that impressed with the first half of this film but when the action kicks in, it is truly superb. Watching, most of the Marvel heroes in one epic battle, was a spectacular moment in cinema but I'm sure that it would have been completely different if Thor and the Hulk was involved. I did find Bucky/Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) a bit dull, mainly because he was the cause of all the trouble and he didn't seem to speak or interact with anyone but maybe that's because everyone wanted to kill him. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), also wasn't his usual, charismatic self, which was a shame because the movie could have done with a bit of humour. They finally put the Falcon (Anthony Mackie) to good use, and some of his gadgets were quite impressive, and it was good to see the Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and Spiderman (Tom Holland), play a big part in the epic battle. I'm not quite sure what the Black Widow's hero abilities are but she always seems to be in the middle of everything, and I think she is the only superhero to make an appearance in all of the Marvel movies. Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) seems to have the most unique super hero abilities out of all of the Avengers, to date but with a huge line-up in comic book hero movies planned in the future, I really can't imagine what direction these Marvel movies are going to go in but it's very exciting. This movie did seem more like an Avengers movie than a Captain America movie but as the focus was more on the Winter Soldier, I can understand why they put it under the Captain America umbrella. Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed the action scenes and the director gave each individual superhero some depth and well earned screen time. I can't wait for the next Marvel movie!

","An impassioned disagreement breaks Earth's greatest superteam in half and ultimately drives them to fight with more than just words. It's basically The Avengers 2.5, but you already knew that. And like the preceding two star-studded chapters, most of what makes it work is the thrill of seeing all the big names geared up together, slinging zingers and blowing dollars through the VFX budget like t-shirts from a cannon. It's a more serious take for the series, sober and steely outside of a few great jabs from the new guys (Ant-Man and Spider-Man steal the show on this front). Which is fine, it adds a necessary level of gravitas to the subject and it wouldn't seem proper for Iron Man to be going all tongue-in-cheek while he's trying to punch his buddy's eyebrows off. That heavy-duty weight can make the film feel long and overstuffed, though, and all told I was feeling a bit weary by the time it got around to wrapping itself up. There's a whole lot of action, as you'd have to expect, but this time it feels less grounded than in the past. It's as comic book as the MCU has ever been, really, with loads of Kool Aid-colored lights shining around the room, bodies flying through walls and one ridiculous chase scene in which our heroes sprint through traffic at highway speeds. And that's the focus, no doubt about it: action with a side of Bucky, whose quest for answers and redemption seems far more important than the moral dilemmas and personality clashes that split the Avengers. Personally, I was more interested in that lesser-explored gray area, but at the end of the day it's Cap on the marquee so I can understand the emphasis on his pet plot threads. It's a strong, solid entry and a fine continuation of this cornerstone franchise, but at times it tries to pull off too much. Could've easily been broken into two films, and I'm almost never one to recommend trying something like that.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

","I'm not a Marvel fan and I don't really care for blockbusters, but I saw Civil War to see if it would maybe change my mind. It didn't. To say Civil War is a bad movie, though, is false. It's not a bad movie at all, it's a good movie, and that's about it, really. Just like most Marvel films - with the exception of Guardians of The Galaxy, their best - directing throughout most of the film is bland, generic, like the camera is there to show what's going on and that's it. Dialogues are shot in the most traditional and tasteless way, exposition is everywhere, editing is irritating and distracting, using way too many camera set-ups because, apparently, they think the average film goer has a 10 second attention span. Not even visually the film pushes any boundaries. There are, though, indeed good qualities to it all: the plot is very good and treated in a straightforward and interesting way, diverging from the traditional Marvel Formula plot we've seen in many movies before but wouldn't be able to hold a film of this size. Apart from that, the true standout here, where the film really is able to be a little more than expected, are the action scenes. Civil War has some of the single best choreographed fight scenes I've ever seen in American cinema, a level I had only witnessed in Korean action films, though most of the action in CW is downgraded by the frustrating Hollywood editing. In the end, even considering all the flaws, it's all very fun, and if you already like these characters, you'll probably love the film anyway.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

But this movie very quickly succumbs to a kind of Americana propaganda where ""freedom"" means nothing more noble than a lack of accountability for one's actions; and what is ""truly American"" is defined by the person with the biggest ""gun"". Captain American apparently has that gun, in the power to do ""what he thinks is right"" even unto becoming a criminal in the eyes of the nation he alleges to represent. Because he has the power, he gets to decide what is right and ""American"" over everyone else; and one ends up with a person or a group of people causing terrific damage to property and life because they feel their cause is noble. In any arena other than ""Americana entertainus"" this would be called terrorism. Especially when Cap's ""justification"" for even more loss of property and life . . . turns out to simply be the machinations of one man imprisoned by a need for revenge and willing to go to terrorist ends to sate it. So the movie ends with even those allegedly championing ""freedom"", all being ""imprisoned"". To vengeance; to terrorism; to even a propagandacized interpretation of ""freedom"". A good mindless story, no doubt . . . and well-done in this regard. But not the usual caliber one has come to expect from the franchise of Stan Lee. His ""flagship"" creations usual have just as much if not more to do with moral fiber as with action and destruction. I reserve my highest ratings and reviews for movies that leave you with something beneficial to chew on.

","After the disappointment that was 'Batman vs Superman', Marvel had a lot riding on 'Civil War' and thankfully, this was a better film. However, that doesn't mean it wasn't without its problems. The opening was a neat way to showcase our new Avengers, flaunting their powers and flashy new gadgetry. However, this action sequence suffered most by having our heroes go up against Crossbones - Brock Rumlow from 'The Winter Soldier'. When Crossbones was foreshadowed in the prior film, it seemed his vengeance would result in a lot more pain and consequence for Cap, yet within five minutes he had been reduced to a pile of ashes. When you cast Frank Grillo it makes sense to make him more than just a throwaway villain. The Lagos sequence didn't deserve Crossbones as the antagonist; it could've been one of hundreds of minor criminals from the Marvel comics. Rumlow's character was built up so nicely in 'The Winter Soldier', it's such a shame to see him wasted as an average 'villain of the week'. I would, however, like to mention how impressive the calibre of action is in this movie and the previous Russo Brothers directed Cap film. The opening sequence on the ship in 'The Winter Soldier' is one of my favourite action set pieces in all of film and it made me so happy to see them bring this kind of action over into the next film. It makes me giddy to think what they'll do with the Hulk and Thor in 'Infinity War'. After Lagos, we are subjected to quite a bit of exposition and plot building (Hello, Thaddeus Ross). While it all feels important and necessary to lead our heroes to eventually come to blows, a lot of it does seem to drag on. However, things spice up with the introduction of T'Challa aka Black Panther. If I had to compare T'Challa and Black Panther as two separate characters, I would say T'Challa would be my favourite. Of course, they are the same person but the emotion and expression Chadwick Boseman puts into the face of the Wakandan left me in awe and I'm glad he took of his Panther helmet in his scene with Zemo. Even though this is his debut, already I feel T'Challa is one of the most rounded off characters in the MCU, imbued with nobility and a sense of righteousness we haven't felt with any other heroes thus far. Even though Black Panther came close, for me my new favourite superhero leaving the cinema is now Ant-Man. I loved the 'Ant-Man' movie; it was funny, it was quirky and it was feel-good. But it left me wondering how on earth Scott Lang would fit into the world of the Avengers. 'Civil War' gave me that answer and now I just want Paul Rudd to be in every Marvel movie. Please. Lang's introduction to Cap was hilarious and things only got funnier when the airport sequence kicked off. To see Ant-Man pretty much take out Iron Man showcased just how powerful and useful a hero he could actually be, which is something that didn't shine through in his standalone movie. His team up with Hawkeye, or 'arrow guy' as Scott calls him, was a perfect homage to the comics. But nothing beat the moment when he became Giant Man, lumbering around the airport in a slow, clumsy manner, taking on anyone he could catch up with. Now, the airport sequence. Easily the best superhero set piece in the entirety of cinema. Hawkeye has a staff, not just arrows. Scarlet Witch is not someone you wanna get on the wrong side of. The Falcon actually becomes cool. And, of course, everything about Ant- Man. Every hero got to strut their stuff in this sequence and even though there are clearly some Avengers stronger than others, they all have their advantages and powers against each other. The only thing that let it down was the fact we knew nobody would die. Even the Rhodey scare was quickly dealt with. Most of these people are friends and don't actually want to hurt each other; something Scarlet Witch points out to Hawkeye after his scuffle with Black Widow. One things most critics agree on is that Marvel consistently provides us with weak villains. Crossbones fall into that category, but for me Helmut Zemo, played by Daniel Bruhl, was actually one of my favourite villains. He wasn't the typical villain; he had no powers and, for the most part, he stayed out of our heroes way as he conducted his own mission, tracking down the other Winter Soldiers. He ended up being the mastermind of the final skirmish as he revealed to Tony that Bucky killed his parents. The reasoning behind this was probably the weakest part of Zemo's character, but it resulted in a brutal fight between Iron Man, Cap and Bucky. A fight that will assumedly change everything for our heroes. Thankfully, T'Challa stopped Zemo from killing himself in the Russian snow and instead sent him off in handcuffs to Martin Freeman, meaning we will get to see Freeman (nice, although it was a brief appearance) and Bruhl again. All in all, 'Civil War' was a good movie. It had its flaws and it wasn't the best MCU movie, but it was thoroughly entertaining for the majority and sets up a lot to look forward to in the upcoming movies. One thing that worries me, however, is the number of characters. Everyone got their moment in this film but with Marvel adding more and more heroes, yet being too afraid to kill any off, one can't help but wonder how long it will take before the MCU becomes too oversaturated with these characters. Hopefully, 'Infinity War' will be the solution.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

","This film is one of the most amazing films I have ever watched. There is so much action going on in this film. I also love the story line in this film as well. There is so much emotion in this story. Love, Loss, Sadness, Happiness and Relief. These are only a few emotions I had during this film but I am sure I felt I lot more than this during this wonderfully directed film. How the avengers have separated into 2 groups and fighting against each other is also an exciting new twist. Lots of reviews I have read say that they didn't like spiderman in this film but I think that this is a great addition to the movie. Because when they are fighting I feel like all their relationships that they have had together go out of the window because they are trying to bring each other down. When they are fighting they get a bit aggressive and one of the avengers gets injured. I am not going to say who got injured because that would be a big spoiler. There is also some quotes in this film that only Marvel fans will be able to understand. Some of them are actually quite funny. What I also like about this film is they have kept some of the original cast for the first few movies that had been released which I was thankful for. I am so grateful to the team who have decided to make this film possible it was just a fun, exciting movie to watch. I would say that I am a big avengers fan I love watching the movies because they are exhilarating to watch. Also, they are jam packed with adventure and action in this movie. In my opinion, I think that it's the best film that Marvel have written so far. This film has got exciting twists because Captain America has got his team and Iron Man has got his team fighting against each other. There are two teams that are fighting against each other. The films normally have got one team which is bad and evil people and one is good people.

","Comic book superhero movies have been blowing up theaters for almost twenty years now. Marvel has been reigning champion for more than half that time, and DC has stepped up their game with their opening moves toward building a cinematic universe. What I'm saying is we've seen a lot of costumed heroes beating up on supervillains and foiling their plots at world domination/destruction/etc. at this point. To keep things fresh, the studios have to find ways to change it up and 2016 saw not one but two different films focused on superheroes turning their fists on their brethren (well, three if you include X-MEN: APOCALYPSE where Storm was temporarily on the villain's team). While Batman's battle with Superman failed to be the explosive intro to Warner's eventual JUSTICE LEAGUE they might've hoped it be (especially critically), the civil war in Marvel's cinematic universe went to show that you could put cram all of your existing superhero roster into a film, go so far as to introduce a few more new characters, give them all a reason to brawl, and still come out with box office gold. CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR is Marvel's most ambitious film to date and had every reason to fall apart, but the team behind the camera managed to put together one of the best entries in the studio's canon. It manages to avoid the increasingly clich√© superhero storytelling tropes and also shakes up the inter-character dynamics amongst the dozen or so heroes we've come to know.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

With a slate full of interconnected movies still set to 2019, it can be reasonably assumed at least one of these things has to be a dud, a catastrophe, a Batman & Robin (1997) level misfire.

However, my excitement did not meet a good movie. Moments of this film were genuine and stirring such as all of Black Panther's scenes. However, most of this movie was tiring and some elements were not needed. I felt that the villain was not needed or could have been written into the story in a better way. Besides some of the shaky footage, the action was great. There were some intense fist fights and chase scenes that really grounded the movie. However, the main showdown between the two teams felt a bit brief. Besides the main characters and Black Panther, the rest of the characters were poorly written into the story. Everything felt a bit brief and too convenient like all Marvel Movies. I feel that the new Spider-Man will divide fans. His performance way OKAY. Nothing really special, but I guess we'll have to see more of him in Spider-Man Homecoming. I did not like his introduction. It felt too convenient and a bit rushed. In the entire first act, the movie failed to capture my attention. Again, there were some really great and intense moments, but overall the film failed me personally. There are emotional moments and moments you never thought would happen, but too much set up and time wasted ruined these moments for me. The special affects were mostly good except for Iron Man. When Tony Stark is wearing his suit with the helmet off, it is easy to see how poor and lazy the special affects division was in this movie.

But the themes that it covers underneath the cover of all those superheros are fantastic(hear it BvS). So It's basically about Steve protecting his best friend from everyone as he is declared a terrorist and willingly to go any lengths to save him. At the same time it shows that scarlet witch , the most powerful character cannot control her power which happens in every movie where a female has very high power but the difference is here.In other movies she will at the end destroy everything and her lover will kill her but here it transforms into an agreement which some are willingly to sign while others reject and there we have two teams of heroes against each other. Admit it they have taken many lives since avengers were formed but Tony seeks Redemtion so he wants Steve to give up his friend but Steve knows he is right and has done nothing wrong.Then starts the epic chase pitting Iron Man against Captain America and leads to introduction of the fantastic Black Panther and ever funny Spider Man.There are many twists and turns but you can watch it.I will not say everything The biggest turn is the reveal that Iron Man's parents were killed by Winter Soldier(under influence of course) and then begins the best part of the movie .The Fight where Steve leaves his title. All characters have some important part to do and are well written but a little poorly executed apart form main 3.Antman is hilarious like always. Another Part of the movie I loved is that the villain is a common man taking revenge for death of his family and is So much determined that he has succeed almost 100% which is so much satisfying as villains rarely do that apart from killing one or two.Without killing any character this movie makes an impression.

","It is no understatement that comic book movies nowadays are really kicking out and breaking boundaries in theaters these days. Since Christopher Reeve made you believe a man can fly, Tim Burton has made Batman relevant again (before getting embarrassed by Joel Schumacher and rebooted by Christopher Nolan), and Sam Raimi has brought to life what is possibly the most definite Spider-Man movie ever. Where the ""Captain America"" movie series has succeeded is by basing its movies on successful espionage stories. ""Winter Soldier"" was based on the book, ""The Manchurian Candidate"" and this one owes a great debt to ""The Odessa File."" After the Avengers unwittingly cause an international incident, U.S. Intelligence decides it's time to restrict their activities, but Cap meanwhile tries to defend Bucky who has been framed for an assassination. Their different opinions split the Avengers in half that culminates in the top scene in the movie, a clash of all the characters from the last several MCU movies excluding Thor and the Hulk while including Black Panther and Spider-Man, making this a super- sized ""Avengers"" movie that thankfully doesn't get bogged down by the excessive characters. However, where the movie makes its fatal flaw is by not picking up from the Sam Raimi ""Spider-Man"" trilogy and instead inserting yet another rebooted Spider-Man with a young and hot Aunt May. Even without Tobey McGuire, it should have cast a new actor to pick up where Raimi left off with his version of the character, bringing those movies into the MCU while ignoring the ridiculous Marc Webb DC Universe version of the character. That snafu aside, ""Captain America: Civil War"" is awesome and spectacular; upping the ante on the previous Marvel movies.

","I had really low expectations for this movie. Mainly because so many people hyped up Batman VS Superman and it ended up being one of the biggest flops in the Super hero movies I've ever seen. So ever since then i had high low hopes for movies like this. However, this time I was extremely satisfied! The plot includes the authorities or the ""high power"" getting involved with The Avengers due to them being very irresponsible and lacking respect when it comes to the citizens of the country. Iron Man and Captain America are now in a head to head battle with each other due to their different ways of thinking. Captain America wants to bring down the bad guy normally, where as Iron Man wants The Avenger not to get involved and do anymore harm. This is where the rest of the team pick sides and if it means they will battle it out, so be it! The moment the film starts it's nonstop action! Just when the action cools down and the slow pace starts to happen...just when you think it's going to be Batman VS Superman all over again, it ends up being a dark, roller coaster ride more than you could possibly imagine! You get to see a whole darker side of Tony Stark this time too. i wont reveal why or how, but you'll see when you watch it. The fight scenes between the Avengers was at least 12 mins long. That's double the Batman VS Superman fight! I really enjoyed it. The ending left me really wanting more and left me with an upset feeling, but not a bad thing! All in all, surpasses Batman VS Superman by a long shot! And I have to say add this in: Tom Holland as Spider-Man was hilarious and downright awesome!

Doctor strange does not have a reliable creative team behind it and neither does the upcoming Spider-Man movie. I have high hopes for the black panther though, and the foundations of the MCU have now been solidified with nigh indestructible material. This film is fantastic. Easily the second best superhero film ever after The Dark Knight. I have very few gripes with this film, which is surprising. They could have trimmed a bit of the fat on the running time and removed a pointless romantic subplot. But other than that the movie exceeded my expectations in every way. The characters in this film are three dimensional and feel like they could be real people. Everyones motivations were well established and I couldn't really choose a side in this movie as both sides had interesting points. Even the villain had understandable motivations in this film and I could sympathize with him, if only a little (I do feel that he could have been in the movie more). The story was excellent once again and even topped winter soldier's politically turbulent undertones.

The ensemble's performances, especially Chris Evans as Captain America and Robert Downey Jr. As Iron Man, infuse the film with emotional depth and conflicting ideologies that elevate it beyond a mere superhero spectacle. The film's strength lies in its deftly crafted storyline that navigates the intricate web of loyalties and consequences. While the ensemble cast can make the plot feel crowded at times, the editing manages to juggle the myriad threads with precision. The musical score, a dynamic symphony of heroism, enhances the gravity of the conflicts. Cinematography captures the kinetic energy of the superhero clashes with a visual finesse. Captain America: Civil War, with its underlying theme of friendship strained by conflicting ideals, emerges not just as a superhero epic but a compelling exploration of the human side of heroism.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

","In the same year of the well constructed Deadpool and the horrid Suicide Squad this movie nestles within competent and moronic. Joe and Anthony Russo two phenomenal directors who brought the thrilling Winter Soldier film in 2014 lost all of their style and interest in favour of a bombastic light show with little substance and minor moments of actual content worth the price of admission. It is comparable to the likes of pro wrestling. You come for the commercialization, colorful costumes, special moves, and decent one liners. These flicks are not known for there fascinating and ideology challenging plots. But with our titular characters coming to blows in what was hyped up as the battle that would tear the avengers apart, it feels shallow. The traits of Tony and Steve are entirely stripped in favor of orchestrating a conflict that will get our heroes into their suits to crack more jokes and make light of a terrorist manipulating a war victim into commiting atrocities. If you wanted a movie filled with silly jokes for kids, then make it that. The tone of this film feels as inconsistent as teenaged emotions (which is to say that is 50% of the demographic) and that is not a good thing. Not a single hero acts like themselves or what they were built up to be. Tony's guilt is actively the only sensible thing that propels the conflict. Caps motivations are so out of left field to me that it feels so coporate you can see the shadow of disney executives in some frames. Furthermore for a movie with such a large budget you could make it look as if your actors are in their suits and not rendered onto a PS2 era graphic. Not to mention the colour palette (dark grey or light grey), cinematography, shot composition, acting, and a million other factors that make this high budget hollywood flick feel like it was made by an Indie film stuido (many of whom could do far better.). For a film hyped up to have insurmountable stakes it feels like all of our favourites are made of rubber and only get hurt when the plot demands it. Say when Colonel James Rhodes falls from a height that would kill a normal man with or without a super suit becomes only paralyzed and not oh I don't know, dead? Another example of this is when Scarlet Johansson's Natasha Romanoff lays off the nigh invulnerable Black Panther with a small tazer. I understand it is a fictional universe with giant men but they could retain some level of consistency with their own take on logic. But to some up and quit my annoyed rambling, Captain America: Civil War is a bad movie in a year of horrible duds. The fights are shallow and obviously made to sell toys. The ""adult"" moments are forced and scarcely placed. The tension is nonexistent and our focal heroes are so out of character you cannot remember a single moment when they were actually likeable.

Tony Stark is supposed to be one of the most clever dudes on Earth but doesn't even try to look beyond the facade. Sure, people could get emotional and irrational at times, but come on none of the things that happened in the movie felt meaningful enough to justify such a mess. There's been tension in between Avengers since day one, but was a random guy seeking revenge enough to have them try to kill each other? He does no mind games, actually he doesn't even seem to know the characters that well. He simply puts up a beginner-level conspiracy and enjoys the show. Yeah I know, Bucky killed Tony's parents, anyone would get irrational about it. But still, trying to kill Cap for not telling him? Everyone knew he had been brainwashed from the very beginning, and we are talking about the same Tony Stark who had been all rational and thoughtful with deep talk about the relationship between superheroes and government.

","Captain America Civil War is without any words the best comic book movie to date. The Directors, Anthony and Joe Russo did a great job bringing these characters in life. Every one of the heroes (& the Villain) has their time to shine and non of the stories feel out of place. Black Panther is the most serious and the most wise in the movie. Scarlet witch and the vision are the most interesting because they are the students of the film. Both are trying to understand what they were and what they have become. (They fear their powers) Ant-Man and Spiderman are the spotlight of the film by bringing fun and jokes. And by speaking of spider man...Finally after 14 year since we got the first spider-man movie in 2002, now we get spider-man done right. Tom Holland nailed the role of peter parker like none before and brought life to the character of spider-man. Robert Downey Jr. gave his best performance of tony stark since the first iron man movie and brought a lot more emotions in some of his scenes. Captain America showed he has come from a long way and has evolved as a character. And now he's in a part of his life that makes him finally feel old and tired. You can understand his motivations and his goals. Baron Zemo is by far my favorite MCU villain. He plays the long game, he's smart and has patience. You understand where he's coming from and why he is doing what he is doing. And at the end he succeeds he goal (not 100%) he destroyed the avengers.

Batman vs Superman was for sure a better film with more in depth character development and the movie actually made me care for the characters.

The movie gets way too much praise while BvS gets way too much hate. I don't expect jokes to pop up when the world is at stake or people are fighting in the middle of a battle. Why this keeps happening in Marvel movies is beyond me, probably to keep the shallow kids and fans going through the movie. BvS got criticized for being too dark and having too many characters yet this is one of Marvels ""darkest"" movies and has the largest cast of any super hero movie and this gets praise? The amount of plot holes I found were laughable, but no, people are going to ignore it because it's a Marvel movie and the action is eye candy. But when DC does it it's the only thing people notice. I have a suggestion, instead of watching this mediocre and copy and paste Marvel film, go watch something else. Here are some suggestions, want to still watch a Marvel film? Go rent one or find one on cable, it will be exactly the same, trust me. Want to still go to the theater and watch a real super hero movie? Fine, watch Batman vs Superman.

","Without a doubt, by far the best MCU movie of all time and Marvel overall. An amazing CLASH of the titans, where everyone fights everyone, no one believes no one, but everything is fighting for a cause in which they believe in. The Avengers divide over a serious political debate which tears them apart into two seperate sections of the Avengers, one led by C.A. and the other by Iron Man. Every superhero gives his best in this movie to proove his worth and specialty as a Marvel Comic character and that is why it is so special. Alone the fact that this movie doesn't need a real villain to be good prooves by point first hand. The Spider-Man apperance was beautiful and so perfectly timed that it feels more natural than any situation in which we've seen Peter. He is obviously a young kid, but a kid aware of the dangerousness of being a hero so small amongst the real giants like C.A. or Scarlet Witch.

","In my humble opinion, this is the finest super-hero movie made to date. Is it perfect? No. Does it come close? I think so. I found it superior to both Avengers movies (which I loved), and certainly far superior to Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice. I think that DC still have a way to go to match the MCU. The fight scenes in this film are exciting, and the action seems to flow seamlessly. The storyline is good, and there are a couple of good twists. Even though so many super-heroes appear on screen at the one time during the main fight sequence between the two sides, it never seems as though the audience has been given too much sensory input. My advice to you super-hero fans out there is to make sure you see this movie on the big screen.......twice!

The fight scene between the heroes that was teased in the trailers is so awesome.

Captain America Civil War which I've just viewed was the most crashingly boring and over long movie I've seen this year and it's now July. It was something to do with politics, which I had to look up as I didn't have a clue what it was about. It seems that Captain America's team were anti government intervention (Republicans) and Iron Man's team were in favour of government telling them what to do (Democrat). Bringing Right and Left politics into comic books would be above the heads of the demographic that the movie was aimed at, ie, teenagers and young twenties, so it beat me why this dreary bore fest ever got filmed. The kids don't care or would not understand anyway and only want to see the action or glamorous women like Scarlett
Johansson surely. The only minor relief was the introduction of Tom Holland as the new Spider-Man who at least is entertaining but we only see a very small amount of screen time.

","I walked into Civil War with high hopes and dreams that almost all were reached of my high standards. There were some idiots in my cinema who complained they didn't know who Crossbones or The Winter Soldier were (they had not wanted to see CAWS and only came for the avengers) so If i sound angry it is because of those idiots who demanded marvel should have explained the characters for people that didn't see the others. Okay so this isn't an adaptation of the comics AT ALL. The one thing that upset me was that Crossbones was killed in the first few minutes of the film (unlike comic civil war were he kills Cap with Agent 13). Now Tachaka is in the film but is killed off early on to motivate Black Panther witch is good. The main antagonist of the film is Baron Zemmo (or just Zemmo as instead of being a Hydra agent and all that stuff, his family died in Sakovia as he is sakovian) he tries to take down the Avengers by making them fight each other. He is mysterious and overall a good bad guy for Marvel's standards and could possibly come back one day with the purple mask as for once he is not killed off. The best parts of this film were Spiderman and the fight scene. Spiderman is young and a bit of a beginner but never the less he is interesting. And he jokes around a lot and also fan girls over Buckeys arm. The middle battle was awesome with great characters and great stories, especially Spiderman and Black Panther. Another BIG part of this was Giant man and the AT-AT reference I did not think they were going to make but they did it.I was upset Black Widow betrayed Team Iron Man. Even though the 3rd act is emotional it has lost a lot of steam from the action pact events of the 2nd act but is emotional non the less. I like Chris Evans as Cap any day but the most emotional thing I think they could have done for Starks character was for him to kill Bucky or Cap in the end. The movie ends with Cap going into hiding, featuring two end credit scenes including Cap putting Bucky into chryosleep in Wakanda and a Spiderman set up.

","First of all I want to say this is an Action packed movie but it's not better than Batman V Superman. There are so many heroes that it will impress you, the action scenes and story line are tight and the action is non-stop, you wont be disappointed. There are a few breakout stars, Tom Holland is big in this movie and stole the show, also Paul Bettany as the Vision is just Awesome, he brings an intellect and presence that is better than the Vision ever was in any comic adaption since the beginning, yes he's good, and he must be in Avengers 3! Also Jeremy Renner was really good in this film, he really proved his usefulness, he just gets better with each film, he was good in AV2 so I hope he will show in AV3 and any other Marvel films he shows up in why he's an Avenger. However once we get the Excellent action sequences and the excellent story line, there's the unfortunate consequence of loosing a lot of Robert Downey's marvelous charisma and wow factor, we don't get to see too much of the magic that we've seen on AV 1&2 and the Iron Man movies, the story keeps moving along which is good but we miss seeing his good side, remember he is still a good guy, he's still a hero at the end of the day even if he's not a role model, we don't get to see that good, funny charismatic and charming side of him which makes him radiate. I hope he will in Avengers 3 and we also missed those little brainsy verbal interchanges where they point out surprising and thought proving parts of each of their characters as they did in Avengers 1&2, please keep those sharp verbal exchanges coming they really make the film. Also another consequence of the fast moving story is, there are no supporting characters, Gwyneth Paltro, but they did include William Hurt which could mean another Hulk Movie? To tie in with Avengers 3? I hope you realize how important these supporting characters are and hope to see Stellan Skarsgard, and Natalie Portman, along with Paltro, and a few others at the Final in Avengers 3. However before then please make sure Thor 3 Rocks and if possible have Hulk in it, Ragnarok and Hulk smash, sound great together like peanut butter and Jelly and please make sure Tom Hiddleston (Loki) is there he is just fantastic! Finally Thanos must be not only a force to be reckoned with but should look the part, and the kitari should be done away with for another better alien army like oh say the Skrull (you showed the Kree in Guardians)and maybe you could throw a new F.F. this time get it right (the last one was bad) stick to the comics, Reed Richards is a serious scientist, get a whole new cast this time, better and more serious this time (although the thing and torch should still joke around) lets see Galactus and Terrax the Tamer and the return on a better Silver Surfer this time get his powers right, they don't come from the board, an appearance from the Watcher, and the Celestials would really be sweet. Make sure you get a director that loves the F.F. Like Sam Raimi loved Spiderman, do make Doom look like Doom with the mask, an Iron man type armor, with the dark green robes hood and make him have presence please, a heavy character. It would be great to have the Skrull invasion they are the most visually striking and interesting aliens and they should be kept the way they are, yes green, with the weird chin and the shape shift, and the Super skrull as well as Annihulus could pop in, the Imperial guard and the Kree all very exciting stuff. I mean if we are geeking out then get Geek done right, look up some of the John Byrne inspired comics for these stories no one wrote them better or more intelligently or as exciting as he did. Speaking of which look up his Hulk comics probably the best and before he left he did the incredible to the hulk and banner, on his last issue, check it out and we never found out what would have happened when the two were separated.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

The red herring plan is great and allows for the perfect conflict. Breaking the Avengers apart is the perfect concept for Marvel, it creates tension between characters that will have to be overcome in the future. We learn about Bucky, learn about Tony's past, and we get a massive insight into Steve's morals. Steve has already been seen doing what's right and just even if it disobeys direct orders, but this time he does it not against the government, but against his best friends as well.

","I really bought into the hype surrounding this film and was hoping we'd all be in store for a masterpiece in the vein of 'The Winter Soldier'. What we get instead is a very convoluted, nonsensical, and unnecessary sequel with a bad guy (Zemo) who's about as scary as an elderly church-going granny. About the only enjoyable things about this film are watching Scarlet Witch in action and realizing that Tom Holland is the one Sipder-Man to rule them all. Holland seriously had some of the best dialogue and action scenes. Black Panther on the other hand gets blackballed in his introduction to the MCU. His place in the story basically just screams placeholder. In fact, Black Panther completely gets shafted in the closing credits...Spider-Man gets a thunderous crowd applause when the words ""Spider- Man will Return"" flash up on the screen. Black Panther gets no such closing credits. Another point of complaint would be just the pacing of the story and some of its elements. The action pieces of the film come in spurts, between long droning stretches of Cap and Iron Man waxing philosophical about who knows what. I actually found myself nodding off to sleep during these stretches of non action. Also a huge problem is the Winter Soldier's central placement in the film and his storyline. Marvel needs to make a firm decision about this character's direction in the MCU, because they throw out a lot of mixed signals to the viewer. At this point, the Winter Soldier is planned for many more films, but he's almost completely unlikable and pretty much somehow lost all his rad intimidation factor of when he was the heel of the last movie. If the audience is supposed to be full of sympathy for the Winter Soldier, Marvel is not stoking that fire in the right way at all. So in conclusion the main positive of this movie is Spider-Man. The negatives are many including character misuse and numerous story misfires.

","With amazing, heart-pounding action sequences, an intriguing character-driven storyline and several fantastic character introductions, 'Captain America: Civil War' is definitely of the MCU's best and also one of the very best in the genre. This is largely due to the way in which its 'superhero' aspects come second to its 'thriller' ones, meaning that the film is about much more than CGI extravaganza. All of the action feels entirely grounded, despite the inclusion of various clearly ungrounded superpowers, and the focus on practical hand-to-hand combat makes the film feel much more palpable. The movie is also full of emotion, as we see characters that we have grown to love pushed to their limits and forced to do things that go against their 'hero' personas, which again adds a sense of weighty realism to the picture. It's a constantly enthralling political thriller, and a lot of fun that never drags, despite its 147 minute run-time. 9/10",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

After the massive disappointment of Batman V Superman, Marvel gave it a shot with their own version, also an adaptation of one of the most popular comic stories of all time. I bring up DC because it's hard to think about Civil War without thinking of Batman V Superman because of how similar they are, and how close their release dates were. And it's quite clear that part of what made Civil War great was that it succeeded where Batman V Superman failed. This review is not just hating on DC, but it really is important.

Most of the events seem to be unrelated and cut-off from the main story like Ant-Man entered as a sudden and so did the Spiderman.

1093,1 May 2016,lucapascucci,8," Civil War: Best of Marvel
","Well its finally here! Many people have waited for this film. Me included. This film seems to have everything. The humour in this film hit spot on! I laughed every time. I have had enough of DC fans saying that if it's funny it can't be dramatic. Thats all bullshit. This film goes from hilarious, to (Mostly in the final act) extremely dramatic and heartfelt. Even though I am a Marvel fan boy, and I would have seen this film anyway, the main reason I had to see it so early was Spiderman. I am a massive spidey fan and to see him in the MCU was fantastic. So obviously spidey was my favorite part of the film. I think Tom Holland got the perfect balance between dorky as Peter and confident as spidey. The one thing that took me off slightly was the slight overuse of cgi for spidey. I can overlook this though and I had a great time with him. Cap again is great, but Downey showed us a whole new side of Tony which was fantastic too see. He was so dramatic and at times angry. It was new and exciting. It seems that the one problem everyone had with the film was the villain and how he was wasted. Because people had said this I was expecting some random villain to show up in the final act like Doomsday for BvS, but that wasn't the case at all. His plan was interesting and well worked and we really got a good insight of the character. For me this was one of Marvels best villains put to screen yet. And the airport scene... well what can I say. Again spidey stole the show for that too. If you thing you have seen the airport scene through the trailers, you are so mistaken. You've seen nothing yet. Black panther for some reason I thought I wouldn't like, but I really did. They some how got me to love him. The characters all got a good amount of screen time and they all got a good story arc. The action is just so much more enticing because we have motivation behind it and a good story. Overall this is my second favorite comic book film (1 being dark knight. There is just no beating that) and defiantly my favorite Marvel film yet. This is a film I could watch 1000 times and never be bored. This isn't just a fantastic comic book film. It's a fantastic film. Period.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

","On May 6th, 7:00 PM, at a packed IMAX theater, there once was a group of four- a movie enthusiast, one of his best friends, his brother and his mother that was watching a little film released by Marvel Studios titled Captain America: Civil War. The previews before the film were either already viewed previously or largely unappealing(with the exception of a preview for Finding Dory). During the first act of the film, the group was certainly getting antsy due to the lack of events going on, despite the occasional great scene. However, once the first act starts to come to a close, lots of things started to turn up and as the film gradually moved on, it got better and better, one scene being topped by the next scene. The amount of humor starts to increase at major levels, the action starts to become more inventive and exciting, and the characters start to develop step by step. The two reasons why I have to give this film a 9 instead of a 10 are because one, the politics did confuse and bore me quite a bit during the majority of the first act, and two, the amount of non- action scenes with little to no tension did become bothersome to me. The rest of the film's quality- well, it's just pure gold, no doubt about it. Every set-piece that knows it's tone executes the scene so perfectly- the action is often engaging and having a high intensity level, the characterizations are fully fleshed out, the comedy is extremely brash yet frequently hilarious(Spidey had everyone in the cinema hall rolling) and the script is full of sharp quips and smart twists and turns. Not only that, but seeing all these Marvel heroes fighting each other for an estimated 17 minutes(such freshly imaginative use of IMAX 3D, by the way) will bring back childhoods of many(including me) that loved Marvel in the past. Overall, Captain America: Civil War is a slam-dunk great time at the movies, full of humor, awe, excitement and reasons why superhero movies can be even be enjoyed by non-fans of comics, and it will definitely stand as one of the best Friday nights I've ever had, and the rest of the audience in the theater I was in can agree with that, as they cheered the movie on fairly loudly at the end of the movie. Also, stay tuned for two post-credit scenes; you won't regret it for a second! And while the movie has great 3D effects, especially on a huge IMAX screen, the 2D version would be just as great if you don't care for 3D.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

","This is a really awesome superhero movie and definitely better then Batman vs Superman. The battle between 2 sides of Marvel heroes is a great take on what happened in the comics. Also Tom Holland makes a great Spider-Man in this and is way better then that idiot Tobey Maguire. Andrew Garfield was his own Spider-Man and there are many people out there who didn't like Andrew Garfield very much either. I say that Tom Holland makes the best Spider-Man yet and I can't wait to see him again in this new upcoming Spider-Man film next year in July. I also thought that since that this is based on the whole Marvel Civil War that Captain America was gonna die in this cause after the war had ended Captain America is assassinated by Crossbones who was hired by the Red Skull. In this Crossbones is a suicide bomber and when the Falcon tries to stop him from blowing up some people, the bomb destroys a building in Wakanda which is the home of the Black Panther. Then when the government tells Captain America and the other Avengers that people wanted them to work under government vision, Captain America sides with some of the heroes who oppose this while Iron Man sides with other Avengers of his own including Spider-Man who accept it. All this battle between Captain America and Iron Man was because of one man who became a terrorist after he lost his family during the battle against Ultron in Age of Ultron. Then Captain America and Iron Man officially went their separate ways and they both try to do good for the world again. Iron Man became the new leader of the original Avengers while Captain America owns his own team of superheroes. The Secret Avengers.

First off this is a film made on a very good script. And anthony and Joe Russo did a stupendous job in handling a vast cast. Robert downey jr, Chris Evans, tom Holland and Chadwick boseman were standouts of the cast. Every other avengers get a story arc of their own but it is still a captain America movie. Captain bucky relationship, Wanda vision dynamics, spider man, ant-man, black panther and iron man's back story were stand out of the movie. Acting of all the cast was good. And the criticisms regarding helmut zemo, villain of the movie isn't a big problem as there are other villains in the movie who provide higher stakes for the movie. He is one of the most symphatatic villain that has appeared in a comic book movie and he corners captain America and starts civil war. This movie is much better than the comic story arc. All the fight scenes are visually enriching and have proved that you do not have to level cities to be visually good. And this movie sets other mcu movies while also telling the current story arc.

Oh well. Every Character does not get a backstory like the usual movies but they did serve their purpose like an original Avengers movie. I kinda had to get used to the kid Spidey on screen but he adds something that the other spiders didn't: youth, experience, and without an origin story. Black Panther also served extremely well but he seemed merely bipolar. However, the movie is not perfect and sometimes putting your favorite marvel characters into a two and a half hour movie, you can only do so much for each character without making it feeling jumbled up. The movie is fantastic and it is great. The plot does not fade it only gets better. And the ending twist was awesome and I am so hyped for the new black panther and spidey movie.

","CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR: This is Marvel Comics' answer to DC Comics' Batman V Superman, and just like the latter, the conflict between the Avengers, with Caption America and his team vs Iron Man and his team is rather contrived. And just like Batman V Superman, when indestructible forces collide there is considerable collateral damage to the surrounding environment as well as huge civilian casualties. When an accident causes a building to be destroyed and lives lost, the UN plans to form a panel to oversee and control the Avengers, who, while defeating threats, apparently have no regard for the ensuing damage that occurs as the result of their battles. Tony Stark thinks this may not be a bad idea, while Steve Rogers feels he alone is fully capable of deciding what actions need to be taken. Thus, the lines are drawn and all hell breaks loose. There are the requisite action scenes; the car chases, air assaults with our flying heroes, etc., etc., nothing we haven't seen a hundred times before, but exciting never-the-less. The many hand-to-hand sequences are especially effective despite the usual over editing typical of the genre. The production design is fantastic as always.

But instead it just feels like they are fighting because Captain America made himself a Fugitive all because he wanted to save his Brain Washed Friend Bucky. And Ironman has to stop him. And as for the team themselves it doesn't feel like the members on each team that they are on, because they Believe In or Against the Segovia Accords. It just feels like the members are on the teams that they are on are one of two reasons, the first is that they are just Big Fans of either Captain America or Ironman, and Idealized them to no end. Or two they simply have no choice in Team Ironman's case. The Airport fight scene was much less Epic than expected specially how everyone Hyped it up to be.

","Captain America: Civil War is probably Marvel Studios' finest movie to date. The superhero registration act resembles that of the comics great, but halfway through the movie you can realize that the plot device is moved out of the focus, which you can either love or hate, depending on what you want to see. There's a lot of characters, and I really mean characters because of their distinct personalities and traits (Unless you haven't seen the other Marvel movies, in that case they are kinda good at best.) The characters developed a LOT in this movie (which is something to say since the other Marvel movies basically followed a formula.) So you will definitely see them changed to a certain degree in the next movies. One thought that crossed my mind in the cinema was: Was there too much going on? I'll admit, there was slightly too much going on in the movie, but what was in the film, they got the best out of. Another thing I personally thought was great about the movie is the change of tone. You get to see The Avengers in a different situation than before, and I think it's refreshing to see a very serious film. I'm also impressed that they pulled it off, since all of the other movies have always been light-hearted. Over-all this movie is incredible for any fan, and I can't recommend it enough.

1126,18 May 2016,amalcom,6," Good, but suffers from being massively over-hyped
","Don't get me wrong, I very much enjoyed this movie, but it certainly did not live up to it's 90% ratings, which honestly just seem to be spite ratings toward the critically bashed Batman Vs. Superman, which was very similar in plot, similar is kind of an understatement, just with a different tone (campy, Wagnerianly epic, and just downright weird). I love the Marvel movies, but the formula is getting a bit weary. The Avengers is perhaps one of the most balanced and best, the original Captain America and Thor were completely fun homages to their source material, Ant Man was surprisingly unique and refreshingly fun. Age of Ultron was godawful and more deserving of 20% scores than BVS.The rest are good but fall into the sequel bin, this one is close to being bin material, but is saved by the most deservedly hyped element, the airport battle. But unfortunately, the rest of the movie seems like two hours of filler. I love the characters, so I enjoyed the ride, but because I know the characters so well, I kind of questioned everything and came up with a lot of pros and cons, I'm so torn on this one, I think a pros and cons list will do best. PROS As previously mentioned, the main hangar battle is perhaps the best superhero fight since The original Avengers. Amazing in IMAX. Ant man, is great, Paul Rudd lends a laid back spirit that the plot heavy character heavy movie desperately needs. Spider-Man is fun, but honestly, there's been so many Spider-Mans at this point, it seems a bit odd, but I do like how young he is, it's a new concept for film Spider-Man. The final battle is amazing but kind of underplayed, which leads me to my first and biggest CON The last epic battle between the two protagonists is not even in the IMAX format!??! It's like after the hangar battle (which is more like playful sparring), they just stopped giving a crap, I could have lived without the initial Africa James Bondsy intro action sequence in IMAX but I know they have to have their beginning IMAX sequence.But really, without the awe of the grand scale effect, the last battle left me wondering about the spotty details of the last reveal and the horrible lame ass unnecessary villain, which leads us to Zemo... wtf, so many ridiculous plot holes, google them if you're curious but wow... Just wow. Number one, his diabolical plan is exactly the same as the also underwhelming Lex Luther in BVS... Like framing a super hero for a blowing up a government building and all just to start a fight.... Honestly, for anyone who watches Agents Of Shield, you're sitting there wondering why the Avengers are farting around with each other when Hive is on the loose. Last Con The necessary but cringeworthy spillover from the god awful Age of Ultron. The Scarlet a Witch holds up well but Vision is just as stupid as he was before. Thank God only one embarrassed mention of the awkward Hulk/Black Widow romance is mentioned. Hawkeyes once again abandons his wife/girlfriend whatever with a bunch of kids out in the middle of nowhere to avenge something or rather while hanging out with his best friend, the Black Widow. And as with all Iron Man involved movies, the inevitable Robert Downey Jr. wannabe tear jerker I'm so concerned speech, eh, why couldn't the last scene have been in IMAX format...

","Civil war, one of the most anticipating movies of the MCU and one of the best movies of the MCU stars the Avengers that we all know and love along with the addition of two new Avengers, Which are Spiderman and BLack Panther played by Tom Holland and Chadwick Bosman. This film puts the Avengers in a bad position when scarlet witch makes a mistake that kills people and begins a conflict between the U.N. and the Avengers which forces the avengers to sign with the governments of the world or go into retirement. which then causes Cap and Iron man to conflict over what course of action the avengers should take in signing the Sikovia accords. That is until Bucky is framed for a bombing that kills Black pathers father the king of wakanda. He was framed by a man named Zemo who is mad at the Avengers for the accidental death of his family in New York (Avengers 1) and he plans on turning the avengers against each other because some of the most powerful people have tried to take them on in a fight but no one has successfully defeated them. and a big part of his plan is revealing who killed Tonys parents. it is revealed that Buck killed his parents while under mind control and steals a serum to create more winter soldiers to take over the world. but Zemo only uses that as bait so that he can get Iron man to fight Cap again. after the final fight Panther arrests Zemo and Caps side runs away and create the secret avengers. in my opinion this movie was great except that no one died. i thought they would have killed cap which would have made the movie much darker and would have made this movie more memorable",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

1138,5 September 2016,isaiahwilson15,9," A comic book fan's dream come true!
","Never before did I believe a perfect comic book movie could exist, Captain America: Civil War has proved me wrong. Where do I start, with the cast of characters so well balanced and executed, or maybe with pulse pounding action that is perfectly sprinkled throughout the movie, then sum it all up with SPIDER-MAN. Before I get too carried away, I will admit that this film does have some minor issues, they are just that, minor issues that have absolutely no impact on the quality of the film. The most prevalent issue throughout the movie lies once again with the villain. Now I think most people are way too hash on Zemo as I thought he was one of Marvel's better antagonists. He received much more character development than previous foes, and also had a convincing motivation. However, he still pales in comparison to the rest of the cast. Despite this, even with the conclusion of the movie, you can see that little bit of extra attention Marvel put towards making a adversary that didn't fall into the category of their previous, weaker villains. Now even with that explanation, I know I still seem extremely biased as I really failed to elaborate on how Zemo was flaw of the film, but that shows just how good Civil War is. Now its finally time to discuss the pros. For the sake of time, I will just talk about the three previously mentioned. First, the characters. MAJOR props goes to Civil War's screen writers as well as the Russo's who accomplish the impossible and find a excellent balance between all 12 of its super-powered characters. Each character has the part necessary for their role in the story, with minor ""Hawkeye-like"" characters not taking up too much screen time from the other major players. Even with these characters minor screen-times, they are still given the opportunity to shine, and no character exhibits this better than The Amazing SPIDER-MAN! Of all the absolutely amazing comic book superhero's, Spider-man has and always will be my favorite, and the announcement of his involvement in this film was, for me, initially met with disbelief. The slightest possibility of Spider-man being included in the MCU was literally the definition of mind blowing. Then it happened, and in the absolute best way possible. Everything from the opening shot of QUEENS to the tune of alt-J's ""Left-Hand Free"" to his heartfelt and especially comedic conversation with Tony Stark to his scene-stealing performance throughout the airport battle, Tom Holland's Spider-man left an impression in 15th minutes that, in my opinion, may have given the world a glimpse at the best on-screen Spider-man we will have seen yet. I know, that was only 2 or the three mentioned topics, but I think by now you get the idea. Civil War is filmed to the brim with comic book goodness that is sure to please fanboys, the causal audience, and everybody in between. It serves as the culmination of the events that have occurred over the past twelve MCU movies, while also being a Captain America movie at its core. It boasts some of the most mature themes ever seen in the MCU while never loosing that classic charm. There is no shortage of action, which is guaranteed to generate oohs and aahs from beginning to end. Add that all up and throw in one of the most recognizable and historic superheros of all time, and you have a perfect comic book movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

","This movie is at the level of badness of Iron Man 3 or Man of Steel. It seems to be no script, just random fighting scenes intertwined with boring-to-death talking scenes. Some of these scenes (like the car scene with Tony Stark parents) are repeated as many as three times in the movie. They also introduce a random romantic episode for Steve Rogers that makes no sense, and shows no chemistry whatsoever. The point is, that no matter the strenght of the Captain, there is always a women above him. The target of the script seems to be ""look at all these stupid males with big egos fighting each other: they would do much better if they all behaved like women do, because women are superior in all aspects, and males should be expendable, and subordinated. And rich"". In fact, no female character in this movie is ever wrong as the plot goes, and one of those even beats the most powerful character, the Vision, in one blow, because ""he had her locked up at home"". Some other scenes are obviously written by a woman with no sense of gender balance, like male characters complimenting others on their eye color, double meaningful comments that the writer didn't catch, and excessively male ass from behind frames. Some character appear from nowhere in the middle of the fight, and they tell the Spiderman story _again_, but this time, making him look like an idiot, broke teenager (tough his aunt May who is supposed to be in her old age, is flirtable by Iron Man, because, reasons). aaand the black Widoe has to fight Hawkeye -again-, because... because that is what couples do, right? They fight! Really, I was expecting way more from this movie. The ending is left unresolved, and many of the side plots as well, not because they plan a continuation, but because they obviously didn't know how to tie up the loose ends. On the bright side: there are some action scenes that really nail it, like the one with all of the heros.

","Civil War is a good movie. There are great heroes, a nice twist in the end (don't worry, I won't spoiler anything that's not already known from the trailers), a bad guy with believable motivation. However, it also has some flaws: At 2,5 hours it feels too long - after one hour the conflict between the main characters didn't even started. It has too many subplots and way too many characters - and especially Antman and Black Panther, this male version of Catwoman, are simply ridiculous compared to the other heroes. Overall it feels like watching Avengers 2, which had similar problems, a second time. It's a good movie, but it can't compare with Iron Man 1 or Avengers 1, the best Marvel movies so far. I think I also liked Captain America 2 slightly better - although this one has Ironman in it - because Captain America 2 has more focus on it's story and not so many characters. This one feels more like X-Men than like Captain America.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

","Captain America Civil War was a flawed Masterpiece! It has everything I could ask for with Spider-Man and Black Panther being great new characters. Iron man and Captain America having amazing motivations to be fighting. Every character feels so down to earth and real in this Marvel movie. There are a few things I do have problems with though. This mostly points to the fact that the movie does feel a bit too crowded in the beginning. The villain is pretty lame, feels like that type of villain that just sits around, doing stuff from his laptop, and not really feeling that intimidating. He also just feels unnecessary. I also don't like how Marvel is not willing to take risks with their characters. I am not the best typer so if you'd prefer to check out my movie review on youtube instead here is the link.

Third, Black Widow's fighting scenes mainly in the first half of the movie. Fourth, it's a movie with superheroes and I'm a sucker for this kind of stuff, so more points added.

","Civil War is my favorite movie of 2016. I usually don't go to theaters to watch films, but I'm glad I went to this one. At firs, i was afraid that the movie wasn't going to be very good. I was disappointed with the rise of Ultron and other Marvel movies that privately came out. I was also worried that the pacing was going to be a mess after I heard that Disney was re-shooting part of the movie to incorporate Spider-man after they struck a deal with Sony. I decided to go and see the movie despite my worries because at list I would see my two favorite comic book character Captain America and Iron-man fight each other. The movie turned out to be better than I expected. The passing was good the fight scenes war amazing, and Spider-man didn't seem to out of place in the movie. The movie itself is about United Nations deciding that the Avengers are too much of a liability. So they come up with an accord a document that gave the U.N absolute power over the Avengers. Captain America and a few others Avengers disagreed with the U.N diocesan. The captain thinks the United Nations will abuse their power and make the Avengers go after people that aren't necessarily a threat. Iron-man was then guilt-tripped into accepting the accord. This causes conflict between the Avengers which results in one awesome fight scene. the story itself doesn't make much sense, and the beginning is somewhat boring, but the ending does make up for it.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

Acting is great, no one could fit the role as Iron Man as good as Robert Downey JR. Chris Evans nails the role as Cap, and the chemistry between Iron man and Cap is the best. The story dos like this: A political rift between Iron Man and Captain America causes them to split up, meanwhile a man named Zemo is out with revenge. This is a avenger movie, only just whiteout Hulk and Thor. There were so many superheroes pressed into one movie. Heroes like: Black Panther, Iron Man, Black Widow, Captain America, Ant Man, Spiderman, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, Crossbones( All though he is not a hero), Warmachine, Falcon, Vision and The Winter Soldier. Is that a good thing. Well in this movie it was. But maybe in future Marvel movies, there will be too many for one movie. We will see. Of course we got to think of the bad things in the movie. It was not easy to find any thing, but if you nitpick you will find somethings that doesn't fit. Like the love story between Cap and Sharon Carter. If you've seen The winter Soldier, you probably know who she is. If you haven't you'll have no clue.

This third film does something even harder, and takes what many people thought was a subpar sequel to a great fist Avengers movie (Age of Ultron) and makes another Avengers movie within a perfectly good third Captain America movie, continuing the story of two engaging properties while expanding on both and tying them all together.

","This is a spoiler free review so please read for information regarding if its okay for kids to watch and if its a good movie(WHICH IT IS). Alright hi, Where do i start? This is a another amazing super hero movie which is totally different from an average super hero movie. This movie is like Avengers 2.5 and I would rather have this be the Avengers movie from last year which was Age of Ultron which was disappointing. Age of Ultron was setting up way too many future movies coming out like the third Thor movie. Age of Ultron was going in a million directions and you would be clueless and ask questions like Why is he in the movie if he isn't related in any way to the story line? However this movie was on topic and had a great story and by the end of the movie you would be like that all made sense. Now lets dive in and see what made this movie amazing. After the events of Captain America The Winter Soldier and Avengers: Age of Ultron, we see our hero Captain America doing his job which is saving people. Captain America alongside with the other Avengers: Black Widow, Falcon, and Scarlett Witch and the last two have become Avengers now, are on a mission when suddenly something bad happens and a building blows up with people in it. 170 countries unite and create the Sokovia Accords which states that any super hero must sign this and register their information just in case something bad happens and you don't get the blame for it. Captain America thinks its a bad idea (which I will not spoil why). While Iron Man thinks its a great idea( Which I will also not spoil). Then it becomes small argument which then becomes a ""war' when a bombing happens and Bucky Barnes aka the Winter Soldier gets the blame for it. Captain America knows it wasn't him and goes against the law to protect his best friend. This movie introduce two major characters who I already started loving right when they got on screen. Spider Man who I thought was like the best character of the movie right next to Captain America and Black Panther who was a bad-ass. Both just fit in the movie and made everything perfect. Spider Man was hilarious and when he came in the movie and enchanted his stuff, I was like he is what made this movie one of the best. Black Panther was a bad-ass. When they introduced him in the movie, he was being fired at by a helicopter and bullets bounced right off his suit and I was just blown away. Im not going to spoil anything else so please go watch this movie. Sadly there was one flaw of the movie, the villain. Yeah there was a small villain who didn't have a costume but in the comics he's amazing! In the movie he isn't :(. Im talking about Baron Zemo who wasn't appealing at all and has a terrible backstory but is a really good mastermind! You will see why in the end of the movie. The action in this movie blew my mind away, the airport scene was one of the best action scene I have scene in my whole life, it was beautiful, well choreographed action and each character got their own solo part which told us why we grew up loving them. So please I cannot stretch it enough to go watch this movie. IS IT OKAY FOR THE KIDS? Yes its perfectly fine just like a couple of uses of S--T which you barely hear so its fine and there was this one quick kiss that wasn't teasing any kind of sexual interaction, just a sweet kiss and was funny, you will know when you see it. This movie also has great positive messages from Captain America like you don't leave anyone behind. Chris Evans has done it again as Captain America and told me why Cap is my favorite superhero. So please go watch this movie and have a great day!",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

And I must say that Civil War is better film than Avengers 2 in terms of talent management, but as a Cap film, The Winter Soldier was a level above. Marvel has made money and raise expecting every time with their shared Marvel Cinematic Universe while pleasing critics too over last few years now. But will they continue? Won't audience get bored of the same superhero story lines after a point of saturation? The answer is not clear, but there always would be something new to keep the audience glued.

","Captain America civil war was a hyped movie. I'm happy to say it lived up to the hype. I loved the movie. The fight between #teamironman and #teamcap was great, the special effects were great and the main thing i loved about that seen is the quirky and humorous comments in between by spider man and iron man. tbh i thought tom Holland would suck as spider man but he was great. One bad thing though was how they portrayed aunt may. I hated that. The one twist i loved that Bucky killed tony stark's parents. The way they turned iron man and cap against each other was good. The recruitment of heroes like ant man and spider man were done well. They didn't have a lot of time to explain black panther's back story..wish they would have explained it...but they're saving that for his stand alone movie 2018. His acting was great too..in fact all the actors were great(though i didn't like Daniel bruhl as baron zemo.) Couldn't find a fault in any one of them. One thing i didn't like was the brief love story between agent 13 and cap. Thats pretty messed up if you think about it. She's the niece of his deceased girlfriend. I mean cmon you must have better options your captain America for god's sake. :)(also I'm hoping pepper and tony come back together again.)Up next is scarlet witch. They explained a bit more about her powers in this movie. And I'm pretty sure scarlet witch couldn't just control vision like that. The stan lee cameo was great as always. #tonystank. The secret endings were great too. But i hoped they'd give a sneak peek in the end about the remaining 2 infinity stones.Overall the movie was good.

","Pls before reading this review this contains SPOILERS & anything that is written here is just my opinion. Civil war is really a good superhero movie not the best but one of mcu's finest. What I had an issue with the movie is the villain. Zemo was a good villain but his plans worked out well because everything happened the way he wanted it to happen,conveniently working for the plot. Other than that what people say is that the movie is overloaded, guess wat guys that's how comic book movies work , in the comics we do have a lot of characters , studios try and reproduce it in the film and civil war has been successful in handling it. The movie showed us y each character took each side , the premise was really clear ( unlike bvs). both Steve and tony came up with really good points for their side, that is some good writing. Cgi was gud , Spiderman best part of the movie. In the end the movie was really entertaining, despite the plot holes, yes there is humour and lot of characters but u can still enjoy it. That is how marvel comics is and they try to reproduce it in the movie , if u don't like it don't spoil it for others, I am not on marvel side I like Dc too but some elements that works in civil war did not work in Bvs. But it is still a really good movie and people who gave -ve review about the movie are just bvs fan boys or someone who think comic book movies are sloppy and have no knowledge bout comics.

It brings up interesting moral dilemmas and political questions. The action is also fantastic in this movie with several cinematic fight scenes being better than in the previous Avengers, but also close-quarters duels that sport excellent choreography and weight in the emotions behind them.

But this time, for this movie, its just nothing less than a travesty. There is NO way this movie can be regarded as high as it stands. And after reading many of the reviews on this site, it shouldn't. The movie is so heavy with its own sense of importance its actually painful to bear. The stories, and there are plenty, are shallow and childish, but the viewer is told that no, they really are deep and matter and you should understand that. I felt jumped by a morale that it tried to present, that the characters were actually fighting something deeper than just spider webs and things thrown at them, that they actually were to be taken seriously. Just for that, the movie tired me. But worse, it bored me. And not because there was not enough action in it, or that not enough things happened, because on the contrary, the scenes were filled with crap it felt an urge to show me.

","I give this movie a 10/10. I enjoyed the whole movie from beginning to end. It's completely impossible to lose interest in this movie, even with it being 2 hours. I love what Marvel did with all of the characters and how they were portrayed. Captain America and Iron Man are the heart of The Avengers and without them there's no order in the team. The team begins to fall apart as the government splits them up. Which caused a spark between the two because Captain wanted to continue to save citizens without the government interference. While Tony wanted to only fight for the country only if the government says so. Let me say that I like how the plot unfolds between the two because of the characteristics they have. Captain America believes The Avengers are doing the world justice by fighting threats bigger than the military's control. Although deep down Tony knows Captain is right he still thinks that they are just hurting people. Before the movie came out, I was only excited for one character. I still like the other characters and enjoyed them but The Black Panther was the most legit character. The Black panther is one of my favorite African American superheroes and he was amazing in this movie. His fighting style is more elite than the Avengers and his Panther like reflexes makes him a better fighter. I also liked how they portrayed Peter Parker. Marvel did an excellent job utilizing Tom Holland's high school like appearance to play as Peter Parker. In the Comics Peter Parker is a young, high school student. But I'm the previous Spider-Mans, although they were all good, they did not give that young, high school persona. All in all this movie is the best Captain America movie.

","If you're into the MCU, this is a solid offering. Interesting story, some good set pieces, new characters add to the dynamic without feeling intrusive, and it delivers on its title (despite necessarily pulling one or two punches for logic's sake). Does have a little too much of the recent tendency of feeling like an episode rather than a standalone film - it is independent enough to be enjoyable, and I understand this is sort of how the MCU works, but by this point there's so much going on you'd almost rather some of the threads were a little more self-contained. Nevertheless, aside from a few slightly over-convenient/inconvenient jumps in the storytelling (probably necessary given the runtime) it's actually impressively well crafted. It would have been easy for this to be a bit of mess, but it feels slick, and doesn't lose its way.

I am not sure if it's some kind of landmark, or maybe the start of a different kind of Avengers film (more Avengers per film?), but this one is definitely the one that it is, and it's the new one. There's more Avengers in this film than have ever been in a film before. More than the 98 Avengers or 2012, or even more than has ever been featured in any of the MCU movies owned by Disney. There's Spider-Man... he's the new kid on the block, always flashing his eye at the old Iron Man and the big boys. In this one he becomes one of them. Also flashing his points is Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, the ant man. He becomes one of the big leagues in this film. If you've never seen an Avenger film before, don't start here. You'll be confused.

","My favourite Marvel movie. Before 2016, I had only seen Iron Man 3 and was pleasantly surprised. I loved that they pitted well-respected and carved-out personalities against each other. In 2016, global authorities had lost most of their credence, and other movies only ever dared to blame black sheep AMONG governments. Captain America went there and explicitly challenged the UN. Loved it. And the coolest guy in the room just says nothing and quietly supports the UN - Iron Man. Until then, this movie was perfect. The story setup was perfect, and the heroes' reactions even better. It's only 9 stars because both got a little silly from there. Consider Captain America: He knows that Iron Man is insane, and that that man machine has a democratic majority that hits harder than his buddies. After that meeting you hide, and stay in touch with your buddies as secretly as possible. That's what I would have expected. Granted, your other buddy has just been brainwashed and you need to save him. However, the last thing you do is suiting up. Instead, you stay undercover. A smash up between Cap's and Iron Man's buddies is audience candy. However, there is no way this situation could have developed. I personally would genuinely have preferred a plot that changed into secrecy and hiding, not a bullfight. Like in Captain America 2 but with enemies that know you (Cap) and might even manipulate you. Not under foreign authority (like here) but e.g. In a Stark Tower: ""Cap, let me show you my latest inventions. No need to sign anything."" Even if Iron Man supports that UN charter, there is no way he would have openly buddied up with THEM. For the simple reason, that his smash buddies would never accept that extreme move. Because as part of the Avengers, they all know the Winter Soldier's backstory.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

Captain America being joined by the Winter Soldier, Falcon, Scarlet Witch, Ant-Man and Hawkeye, and Iron Man teaming up with War Machine, Black Widow, Vision, and newly introduced, Black Panther and Spiderman. Civil War is definitely the most intense and mature of all the MCU films as the audience can invest and personally choose what side they are routing for as they feel every hit and feel like they're triumphing at every counter attack, for these heroes on an emotional level, which is what the MCU has done with all of the involved characters whether it be their own scenes in films or they actually have their own film. Throughout all of the Marvel films from beginning to now it is clear to see how the hero's have evolved as superhero's as well as general citizens.

","This movie has both the intense comic-book action expected of a Marvel movie and complex character conflict.

Iron Man, who helped create the Accords, believes that, as he puts it, they ""need to be put in check,"" while Captain America believes that a) the UN, and the government, are ""run by people with agendas,"" and that b) - when it comes to safety, ""the safest hands are still their own."" Basically that the UN might use the Avengers for their own doing, and that the UN isn't going to know about every threat. I can see both sides to this argument, and don't 100% agree with either, although I'd probably say I lean towards Iron Man.

","Civil War is a masterpiece. And in my opinion the best marvel movie. Just like get out I watched this movie when it came out in theaters and I still love it. Captain America and iron man had been in a good amount of films and had dealt with their hardships. So when this movie came along there decisions have a purpose. This movie has some qualities that I wish more movies had. It has really good dialogue. Characters sit down and talk and it just feels organic than usual. It's mostly because of the energy the Captain America movies have. This movie makes these characters feel real and that's awesome because it gives the universe a nice change of pace. There are other great stuff. Great acting. Great script. Has some of the best action. If I could think of any issues I would say the music. I don't like how marvel changes the score of the films, people made videos of that. I also really don't like the shaky cam it's a headache. The villains plan is also pretty dumb and complicated. But these problems aren't too bad so I can let go of them.

","Reviews are in the eye of the beholder and are so subjective, they are only really useful if you share similar interests. So with that already said, I am an avid Comic book fan. For the most part, have enjoyed the MCU. Loved Avengers, Thor, Winter Soildier. I like what they are doing on TV. I lean towards the DC characters but that will no way influence this review. Civil War, the graphic novel series, was one of my favourite comic book arcs. An early worry of mine, was that by using that name, it was creating a rod for its own back. The issues in the comic book arc could not be an issue in the MCU. There are no real secret identities ‚Äì the emotional themes and pertinent questions could not be asked. While that fear does manifest itself, its not really the problem I thought it would be. My main issue with Civil War is that it really doesn't make sense. The stakes never seem that high. Even the opening scene which kicks off the whole Accords doesn't really have the fallout to deserve such a reaction. The scene from the trailers, running through the Avengers collateral damage is even worse (New York ‚Äì you know, when you repelled an Alien Invasion, Washington ‚Äì when you stopped Hydra killing millions of innocent people). The only one that really makes sense is Sokovia, which makes it even more of a hypocrisy to put the person mainly responsible for that in charge of the UN controlled Avengers. Having said that, IM is one of the things that actually works. Perhaps too much. I came out thinking that he was actually the one that was right all along and it was Cap that was completely unreasonable. Cap's reasoning for not signing the Accords starts off weak, then just gets weaker. Its also a complete reverse of what has been happening in the MCU up to now. There are some real left-field choices in the film. The choosing of teams reminded me of a sports day. There is no real reason for IM to pick Spider-man and plunge a 14 year old boy into a fight against Super- powered adversaries. There's also no point for Spider-man to agree. Apart from launching his own movie of course. That whole recruitment section seemed forced and totally out of sync. Likewise Hawkeye and Ant-man. What's the motivation for these two? Why would Ant-man risk everything for Cap? It makes no sense. And what's happened since Age of Ultron that means Vision doesn't know what the mind stone is? Or how to use it. As I'm pretty sure he shot Ultron with it. There's so much more that doesn't make sense but that's not to say it's not a good movie. There are some outstanding action scenes and its well directed. Black Panther works and is a good introduction. It just doesn't feel like its own film, it feels like a filler film, an episode. It's no Winter Soldier, its more Age of Ultron. Enjoyable, but expected a whole lot more.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

","The Story and the plot seems to be well set but the depiction and the participation of the characters was sadly very biased. The story could have been far better. No major nomination also proves my point. Some characters who are mightier and significant in the next movies are almost neglected or presented as useless in the story such as Vision, Black Panther and even Ironman. Ironman seems to be unnecessarily depicted to be failure and subdued from its capabilities. There is clear evidence that the entire movie just wants to exaggerate the role and might of Captain America, who is actually nothing more than a physically strong and determined soldier. The entire movie revolves around him while others just appear to fulfill their part of the story. Spiderman seems to act like a comic-jocker like 'The Mask'. He could have been presented far better and responsible. Antman has been admitted to the scene without any reason or cause or justification. Vision seemed to like a funny video game Robot without any significant role in the entire movie. Falcon could have been presented better. He has been presented as like a Pet Dog of Captain America and his role is given much importance over others; I think that is very disgusting as he is actually nothing more than a mechanized flying bird. Overall the movie just revolves around Captain America and proves him to be far superior to all others and overlooks the importance and power of its superheros like Ironman, Vision, Wanda and Black Panther.

","The trailer for this looked brilliant but I had pretty low expectations for some reason. Maybe I felt it was a bit contrived, generating a bit of excitement wit two main protagonists rather than one. And for the record I thought the first Avengers film was great, the second one pretty good although the long fight at the end in 3D made me want to just shut my eyes and go to sleep - too much for too long. But this in my opinion is the best of the Avengers films so far. The new characters were all brilliant, solid etc. Black Panther, Spiderman and Ant-Man all brought something unique and genuine and believable. Added value to the Avengers Universe. But the story is only really made possible by the baddie of the movie, Zeno, I think he's called. Yes, we get distracted by all the superhero stuff inevitably, but he brought an intensely human aspect to the movie. No super-robot, killer aliens, or universal tyrants. Just a guy looking to use the truth. He says something like, ""a civilisation that is beaten can rise again. One that destroys itself from the inside out is gone forever."" One of his great lines that adds dimensions of relevance to everybody in the the weird, corrupt, destructive and vengeful world we live in. I genuinely think this movie is, dare I say it, political. Also about forgiveness, friendship, rage, hurt, family, responsibility, recovery. I don't think it deals with these themes in a superficial way either. Genuine quality that can be enjoyed in so many different ways. Only slight negative is when it starts talking about the legality of the Avengers actions. eg. When they are locked up it is because they are criminals. Not signing, doesn't make them criminals. Not even sure the treaty was completed. So is a dubious assumption of authority. With the next bunch of films likely to deal with those power stones, and Thanos, I can't see how we are going to have such a grounded and relevant superhero movie for a long time.

The main reason this film worked is because the characters in this universe have lots of history going back to Iron Man and Captain America: The first avenger. This makes there be so much more weight to their actions. All the actors are on top form especially Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. Special mentions go to Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther and Tom Holland as Spider-Man who slot in effortlessly and take turns completely stealing the show. The villain Helmut Zemo was also great and much more human than we're used to for villains. His story about how his family died is heartbreaking and I'm intrigued for what he does next. The standout scene has to be the airport scene featuring the debut of Giant Man which will go down in marvel legend.

It takes it time and lights a fuse, making not so great Marvel Movies relevant and demonstrating that there were consequences in those films while also having thrilling action and a story that you can really get invested in because of how well-realised the characters are in this film. Forget Avengers. This is the pay-off to those stand-alone movies that ranged in quality that we sat through. We have twists, broken people and relationships, enthralling action and an amazing well-done emotional undercurrent. The action choreography is so well-done and instead of having standard fight choreography like in Winter Soldier the settings combined with the great idea to make a legitimate action sequence instead of some bloated CG fest prevent any action sequence from being repetitive and dull and all of them are quite phenomenal and the character conflict make it more meaningful.

How could they translate the complexity of character and his true coolness but stay away from any cheese? Dress a guy in the flag and remain true to the seriousness of the Depression and World War Two era? Well, they managed to pull it off quite well in the first film. The director knew that you had to establish and truly care about the character. Making it a period piece really helps give it a flavor unlike any other comic adaptation. The Raiders of the Lost Ark flavor was there. In the second film, they met the new challenge of depicting Cap in the modern era. Now, everything established in both Captain America films and both Avengers pays BIG dividends in this Civil War movie. The universe has been established wonderfully and this film does the best job to date playing in that universe. Everything and every scene packs some sort of punch and resonates with true style and heart. They really let the action flow but also allow for key development of the overall story and over concept. This also allows them to probe deeper into the character's personalities. And I'm talking ALL the characters even the ones with smaller roles. This heightens the tension, so often missing from lesser comic-book movies, and adds real weight to the action sequences which are thrilling and often mesmerizing.

","The only reason this is not a 10, in my opinion, is because there were some pointless/ drawn-out points that can make some people lose attention. Being a fan of Marvel Comics, this did not phase me much, if at all, but those that are not comic book fans or Marvel fans will get impatient and irritated about this movie because: 1. It ties together multiple characters and story-line, making it to where you need to have comic knowledge plus see other MCU films prior. 2. At times they become repetitive (Stark's parents' death for example) and draw scenes out forcing some views to lose interest. 3.

","I've sat on my feelings of this film for a while. I've come to the conclusion that it's honestly not great. I love the Marvel franchise, but this film was a huge let down. Everything seems to fall apart half way through the airport battle. For a film putting a spotlight on superheroes causing carnage, the massive destruction of the airport seemed excessive. The final battle between Stark and Cap and Bucky was poorly set up. Stark attacks Bucky out of vengeance instead of having a conversation like this character is known to. This defies the point of the film. The final battle is about vengeance, not conflicting views of how the world works. Even the reason for the Sokovia Accords existing misses the point. The issue of the Avengers is that they violate sovereign boarders, determine their own enemies, and kill without answering to any authority; not that there are civilians killed (though this is also an issue). The characters also change inexplicably. Stark goes from rational man to homicidal lunatic in seconds. The Stark of previous films deeply cares and is incredibly analytical and intelligent, this Stark is a one-dimensional copy. Additionally Captain America acts like an idiot, assaulting a police force who are attempting to arrest a man they have good evidence is a mass murderer. His actions are so unbelievably righteous he is almost a parody of himself. The ending is easily the worst part of the film, Cap's letter removes any impact from the film. It doesn't matter that they just had several battles, everything is fine in Cap's world. The lack of a death annoyed me as well, thematically I felt a death was needed, and it's lack left the film feeling toothless. In the end I didn't hate this film, but I would solidly put it as one of my least favorite Marvel films and I sincerely fear for the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

","I love Captain America films, I really do. I loved The First Avenger, even though many people don't. Plus, Winter Soldier was a masterpiece, it was a movie which combined the excitement of a superhero movie with the thrill of movies like those of the James Bond franchise, encompassing themes of government espionage, parasitism. Civil War acting as a sequel, is a follow up to more than one MCU film and seems like a discount Avengers films along its entire run-time rather than being one of Cap's. Besides this, the movie is great. It is packed with all the action one casual-moviegoer would expect from a summer blockbuster such as this, and references and easter-eggs enough to please one hardcore Marvel fanboy (I am not one). The thing which separates Civil War from Batman v Superman is the different tone of narration and story-telling they undertake. BvS remains dark throughout, and that what makes it a DC film, it shouldn't be criticized for being too dark, STOP IT. On the other hand, Civil War plays balance between gritty, melancholic and laugh-arousing tones, consisting of cheesy one-liners from RDJ and Tom Holland (""Hey Cap, Big Fan, I am Spider-Man) plus heart-melting duels between the heroes we love and cherish. The movie, aside from playing follow-up, sets up a platform for future standalone films, introducing Black Panther, which I think is cool, and Spiderman, who I really want to see give a run to Tobey Maguire for his money. Overall Verdict? You should see it, it is a great flick and please don't compare it to BvS, DCEU is just starting, I could do this all day.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

","Solid movie, although nowhere near as great as its current rating suggests. After the flop that was Avengers 2 (not at the box office, but in terms of quality), this was a nice mix-up. While technically called Captain America: Civil War, this movie straddles the line between an Avengers movie and a Captain America movie. One of the biggest problems I had was the motivations for Captain and Iron Man as to their positions on the accords. Based on everything that we've seen from the two in previous movies, Iron Man is the relaxed character while Captain America is the stern government-follower. Their positions should have been flipped, comics be damned! Spider-Man was delightfully annoying, as he should be. Something that they try to do in this movie is make all the characters even in terms of powers, probably to sell action figures. Hawkeye was in a major fight and he was almost holding his own, insanely unrealistic. Other than these petty complaints, it was a decent movie with OK acting and average humor for Marvel.

It would have been really great if they could have had all their titles to work with, F4 and such. They should've split the two between Stark and Capt. and given us better perspectives of both.... and for crying out loud, the why... I mean don't get me wrong, they had better reasons than BvS, but there needed to be more meat to the cause of the divide.

If I were losing my best friends/long time teammates, I would've fought harder to keep them together. While I do want more, I think with what they had, Spider-man and how they added him, could have been left out. It made the time with him cheesy and the suspension of disbelief more difficult to achieve. In a nutshell, holes.... it left you with and added holes and more...

","It's not politics that got between the Captain and Iron Man - it's the fact that because of his old buddy Captain America chose to antagonise everyone. Oh, and also the fact that he always knows best. It's so exhausting with these movies how they always promote going rogue cuz when you're powerful you always know best and laws don't matter. The only thing I don't get is why everyone labels Tony as arrogant when usually they are both are equally arrogant and think they know best; it's actually the first movie where Tony shows such regard for others and humility to accept that over 100 world leaders might be righteously concerned that 5 people do whatever they please.
I gave it a high rating though, cause for the first time in quite a while a Marvel movie will make viewers think a bit further than the standard black and white reality of the MCU. And because the special effects are great as always :)

","To start off, I am a huge Marvel fan & absolutely LOVE watching all of their films. Captain America: Civil War was a highly awaited one & there was good reason for that, it had all the right ingredients to be the best superhero movie till date. An explosive cast? Check. A gripping storyline? Check. A realistic problem? Check. Drama & suspense? Check. Humour? Check. Excitement? Check x infinity. The movie starts off really well & really does keep you at the edge of the seat wondering what will come next but in the end it let's you down as it ends in a really simplistic manner. (Spoilers beyond this line) Tony finds out his parents had been murdered by Bucky & in a fit of rage & thirst for vengeance faces off against Bucky & CapAm, in the end he gets beat & accepts defeat. But here the plot begs the question: Would a character like Tony who does not give up when his loved ones are in question & who has a fairly large ego just stop because he got beaten once? I don't think so & I feel that's a major plot hole, Tony would come back with a new Iron Legion & make CapAm & Bucky pay. The only way to stop him would have been if Tony had EMPATHISED with Bucky, making him realise that just like he had killed innocents with Ultron unknowingly, Bucky had killed innocents under Hydra's control unknowingly. That's the only way Tony would have realised the flaws of his actions & that an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. CapAm going on fighting as if it was personal rather than an effort to save a friend from a friend also messed with Steve Rodgers' character as a sensible guy. The movie ends on a sour & unrealistic note, Zemo gets his way, the Avengers crumble & Captain America is the only one who gets what he wants - a complete ignorance of the Sokovia Accords. As a regular viewer of Marvel movies I had come to expect their movies ending on positive notes but this one just didn't feel like that & I for one wasn't too fond of the change. I'm not saying the movie was bad, no it was definitely good, Spider man is the best Spider man yet, the interplay of Falcon & CapAm is fantastic, Black Panther is someone you definitely connect with & Ant Man continues to pull much more than his weight however this movie for one had the potential to be absolutely perfect but it wasn't & the only reason for that was the sour finish. An unrealistic finish that completely ignores the character traits of 2 of it's most important characters. If I were to sum up my feelings I'd say I'm satisfied but not pleased as Marvel, in my humble opinion, let slip an opportunity to bring to its fanbase the best superhero movie till date.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

","The movie is too good, it is not that deep or that close to reality but still I totally enjoyed it. It was great to see the that how a different perspective could lead to bad things. Every time you see the movie you get a different view of the situation, in this movie, no one is correct or I should say that everyone is wrong as well as right in their own way.
It's awesome fights sequences are great but only one complaint, which is, I felt that the final fight could have been better, because in the competition 'DC's Batman Vs Superman: dawn of justice' proved to be an underated master piece and it's final fight between batman and superman was actually something that gives you chills but the one in this movie was not up to the mark.
Again Marvel's VFX team did an awesome job in this movie and also the acting done by the cast was flawless. Talking about directory, this movie is directed in a simple way and is easy to understand.
You can't expect anything in the artistic perspective of this movie, it not an a artistic masterpiece and also the tone of the movie was not constant, in some scenes the tone goes a little dark while in some it becomes very light, and also the unwanted comedy ruins some serious moments.
And another thing that I noticed is that the movie did no justice to some characters, like Spiderman, Hawkeye and war machine.The biggest was Spiderman, even after having a character like him they only gave him a very little screen time and also they introduced him as a sidekick, which totally does not justifies the character of Spiderman.

","After Captain America Winter Soldier, I didn't think they could top that with another Captain America movie. Maybe an Avengers movie, but not a Cap movie. I was wrong. Civil War is one of my favourite Superhero movies to date, it had a bit of everything. It had a good cast, developed characters, new character introductions, great fight scenes, a good villain, a good story for the most part. I left the cinema screening feeling like I needed to go back and enjoy it a second time, which I did, and a third. It hasn't replaced Avengers as my favourite Marvel movie, but it's definitely close. With the disappointment of Age of Ultron, I was so happy to see this movie succeed, I had high hopes for Ultron and was crushed by how it turned out, and this really made up for that. It even made Falcon and Scarlet Witch so much cooler than they were in Ag of Ultron. Although it's not an Avengers movie, it did have aspects of being one, but with the core focus on Captain America at all times. His relationship with Bucky, his struggle with his moralistic views and the signing of the Sokovia Accords. You really feel as though it is still a Cap movie, but with a really big cast. The Russo Brothers did a great job in bringing Black Panther to life on the big screen for the first time, you could really feel like they put effort in ensuring this Black Panther feels like the one we grew up with in the comics and cartoons. Whenever he was on screen, I had a big grin on my face, the way he moved, even Chadwick Boseman's acting and accent were fantastic.It makes me really look forward to Ryan Coogler's Black Panther solo movie. Spider-Man's first time on screen in the MCU was brilliant, even though I've enjoyed previous versions of Spider-Man, the 30 minutes of screen time that Tom Holland performed as Spider-Man made all of those other movies look like child's play in comparison. It was very much on point with what we've grown up and I am so excited to see Spider-Man Homecoming, especially now we have Michael Keaton confirmed as a villain, and the most likely inclusion of Downey Jr's Iron-Man. The fight scenes were pretty much on point, with the airport scene being one of the best on screen superhero scenes ever made, full of excitement, fun, humour and action. Ant-Man was fantastic too, we don't see much of him, but from what we do see, it's great, especially in the airport. Baron Zemo as a villain is, for someone with no Superpowers, a really intimidating, cold and calculating villain. I really liked what he did, his manipulation of the characters. It was refreshing to see a villain that wasn't bent on destroying the world, as with most villains in superhero comics. If i had any gripes about the movie, it would be that dots seemed to connect quite conveniently to Zemo's advantage and for the friction between the Avengers. But apart from that, an awesome experience of a movie leaving me very excited for what the Russo's have in store for us with Infinity Wars.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

","For a movie that got such outstanding reviews from most critics, it was quite the disappointment. This is not to say that it was a terrible film. I did enjoy the movie, but I enjoy plenty of movies. Going into this, I expected to watch a Marvel movie with epic action sequences, lots of humor, and a big finale. The action sequences were OK, the humor was misplaced, and there was no finale whatsoever. The airport scene that was raved about was certainly the most enjoyable part of the film, but the tone was unidentifiable. There were jokes, missiles, webs, and threats all being launched at the same time. I will say that there were some fantastically choreographed action scenes, but there were not enough to keep this movie engaging over a 2 hr and 27 min running time. The most disappointing part about this movie was the ending. SPOILERS FOLLOW. In the last act of the film, Cap, Tony, and Bucky team up to stop a mastermind villain. Though, in the end the villain did practically nothing. He literally just pressed play on a video to pit Tony against Bucky. Then he went up on a mountain to shoot himself while the dynamic threesome had a little grudge match. So, that pretty much sums up the film. It was disjointed, bloated, and anti-climactic. Not a great combo. At least there was decent acting, a few funny jokes, and some good fights, but that in no way constitutes a ten start film.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

CA:WS tells how Steve has coped with being frozen for 70 years and then is caught is a web of lies from Fury, Black Widow and Shield. Thor's first movie is okay but too overwhelmed with legend, something Kenneth B is known for. Thor:DW shows the infinity stone of the Aether infecting Jane Foster, who is ""yes"" written as weak, but it can change just like Pepper Potts. Her, PP role in IM3 is awesome!

","A lot of people hate superhero movies for it's commercial nature, and they're just made to squeeze money of our pockets. I was one of those people, but this movie gave me a new perspective on the subject matter. It's true that a lot of these movies are just hyped up to make a lot of money for the studios and they don't do anything worthwhile cinema-wise. But with this movie, it's not. Sure it made a gigantic amount of money, but it was a well made film. Of course, unless you haven't seen a lot of good movies, the plot of this film is pretty meh, but the action is incredibly well made. You can feel that the directors put very much thought into every shots, there are some very clever editing moments, the actors and stunt men practiced hard for the choreography, a lot of scenes are done for real then combine with CGI so they look very real, especially the fights with captain America, Buck, and black panther. This is an all out action film, and it delivers, and much more if you're an action fan like me. It's so rare these days for filmmakers to make a good action film. And yeah they do try to set up later movies for spider man and black panther, but at least they put some thought into it, and they don't try to do too much, unlike Batman V Superman, god that movie was ""booooooring"" ( said in Scott Pilgrim's voice ). So if you want to have a good time, pleasure your eyes with actual good action, action that is well thought out, and well practiced and well shot, not just scenes of some stuff blowing up, give this a watch, throw the whole superhero movie thing out the window, this down to it's core is just an action movie, and it will deliver.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

","First off I used to be the person who watched movies like Braveheart or Goodfellas and never was into Marvel's except Wolverine and Spider-Man. However, I gave it a chance and do not regret it at all. I really enjoy Marvel's now. I always liked Captain America and really enjoyed the first avenger even more than any single super hero like Ironman, Hulk or Thor. The return of the first avenger is even better but this Civil War is great and I really enjoy it. However, it is slightly less as enjoyable to me than the other two captain america movies. The reason more due to Ironman and the producers Kevin Feige who seems to have an affinity with Germany and Europe. He implements a lot of unnecessary and ridiculous commercials for Audi a German automobile manufacturer and for Europe itself. Ironman tells Spider-Man how great Germany is or he would enjoy Paris. Well, Ironman is supposed to be an American super hero and Marvel's are American productions so why not implement Chrysler or something like that to foster American automobile manufacturers. European dislike America and I was born and raised in Germany so I know that besides the beer and a little vacation Germany sucks. So does Paris who is more an Arabic style city than anything else. Kevin Feige is trying to implement this multinational diversity perspective that America is not as good but others are. Germany even had to scrap the name captain america of the title so people would go to the theater. After bad revenue and critics of the captain america the first avenger they realized that they need to change the title to the return of the avenger- winter soldier and civil war.

","The Marvel movies always brings surprises and wouldn't be different. On this title, arises the Wakanda hero Black Panther, on his first appariton. Another black hero working is Falcon. This is good, even talking about a subject so old fashioned. This subject shouldn't exist on 2018. But, lets get it on! About the movie. The best point of the plot for me is when started the deadlocks between Steve (Capt) and Stark placing each one in positions that on the actual days, really can be found. Stark, considered rebel pressioned by the government, for surprise, tends obey the laws and the champion of the freedom, american hero, starts to act an outlaw punisher. The writers really did something cool. Showing we don't need to be static with same thinkings and point of view about nothing. We're thinking beings, dinamic and can change anytime. But, in my opinion, only with ethics and searching for dialog. But, neither always good sense works on real world. Patience, dialog. And, this is the point so easy to notice, the writers and directors explored in an epic, spetacular, amazing battle on airport. Simply, fantastic. Even with the camera effect so used actually in Hollywood. I particularly don't see problems. Another point so strong in my opinion is about revelations. On this universe, the Stark's father, was the creator of the shield of the Capt. And, off course, after another battle, Tony, even defeated, don't waste the chance to tell it. Who looses? There are also a point that Stark discover his fathers murderer. Or at least involved but, if you still not watched this another masterpiece, I'll leave at least it to you.

His vendetta had nothing to do with a power grab or world destruction, it was all personal. For the most part, he did exactly what he intended and used the perfect scapegoat. This movie has much of the action and comedy we've come to expect of Marvel, but this goes a bit deeper. We've seen all the glory of being a super hero and now we get to examine the consequences of being a hero. I love love love this movie from start to finish.

","The only spoiler here is what you've seen in the trailers. The world doesn't want rogue Avengers having freedom to go anywhere, do anything. However, the whole issue is collateral damage done when the examples the political leaders show are minute in regards to the possible outcome. A huge space worm going to destroy a major city? Aliens coming to enslave and kill? Well, you ended up killing scores of people or even hundreds against possible extermination. The other examples weren't even caused by Avengers but only stopped by them at much less loss of life. So the reasoning behind controlling them is weak.

Granted, the mental conditioning that the Russians subjected Bucky to compromised his ability to think for himself, but that should have been more the reason not to trust the man.

The fight was great, didn't expect to see Scott Lang there, but his presence was very enjoyable. Also, loved to see more of Bucky's history be unveiled to us slowly throughout the course of the Cap movies. Hope there is a Captain America 4, but I doubt it will ever happen.

","I'm not the biggest marvel fan but do enjoy some of their movies like the iron man movies and Thor 2. And I guess you can't expect much from them giving it's only action and little good plot (for the most part) and a lot of bad fight lines but I have to say this is by far the worst one. Everything just felt unnecessary, the whole movie seemed to be just to fill out and set up for other marvel movies in the future. None of the avengers decisions in this movie makes sense and just makes you irritated; if you liked Captain America before get ready to absolutely hate him. Have I never seen how annoying he is or is this just a terrible movie? Who knows. The only reasonable person in this movie is Iron Man.

","Captain America: Civil War serves as a sequel to Avengers: Age of Ultron and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Its' main focus is on Steve Rogers choosing friendships between Bucky Barnes and Tony Stark essentially. It features a wide array of many of the heroes we've seen before as well as some new ones like Black Panther and Tom Holland's Spider-Man which was arguably single handedly the best part of the movie. Holland displayed a fresh and young portrayal of Peter Parker and his awe of the famous heroes such as Iron Man and Captain America as well as his charming performance as Spider-Man which easily blew previous Spider-Man's out of the water. This film is carried in part by the emotional side as seen in Rogers and Stark's strained friendship and secrets emerging as well as the action sequences that were very well choreographed and put together. There was a good balance of quirky comedic lines and punches and kicks to keep it entertaining and true to the Marvel persona.

Without giving away too much, the 'Airport scene' in the movie is one of the greatest-epic-amazing-mind-blowing fight scene in the history of superhero movie. But I still miss Quicksilver.

Now I see that it's actually the opposite. It pretends to be anti-establishment but really it's just about justifying a sense of self-entitlement. Like Donald Trump, Capt.

This movie is about Captain America (Chris Evans) wanting to help his friend Bucky (Sebastian Stan), even if it means crossing the law. The way they introduced Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Crossbones(Frank Grillo) was amazing and fights between superheroes are not seen very often and i would always recommend watching this movie, but what makes this movie so great? let me tell you, this is my opinion why this movie is awesome. So the movie starts off with with a great introduction. The introduction is followed by an awesome fight with Crossbones, i wasn't expecting much from him, but overall they started it the best they could. Soon after that Tony Stark (Robert Downy Jr) is introduced and wants to stop the Avengers from doing what ever they want and wants them to abide to the law, because the destruction and deaths of innocent lives. Captain America, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) don't agree and think what Iron Man is doing is wrong.

I guess it had been too long since I last saw ""The Winter Soldier"" and ""Age of Ultron,"" because I really did not remember the Sokovia events and character interactions as portrayed in ""Civil War."" Granted there are twists in the story regarding the villain and his motivations, but the twist literally took me out of the movie when I realized he did more than just set up Bucky. Also I was really let down that this movie's darker depiction was such a departure from the other Marvel movies. Characters literally were about to kill each other over a series of misunderstandings, and we're left with no real resolution to the story's character conflicts.

","There are a lot of intense action scenes but they are not as detailed, unique, and intriguing as they are being praised for. To elaborate, the fight scenes seemed to be fairly average hand to hand combat that gave me the impression that I had seen all those sequence of moves done before on the big screen. In other words seen one seen them all. After a few days of processing my thoughts about the movie I came to the conclusion that many characters were not even necessary and could have been omitted all together along with their side story/sub plots. For example, the Vision, Ant-Man, Spider Man, and (dont kill me, hear me out) Black Panther all could have been left out of this movie and we would probably love it the same. Don't get me wrong they were all awesome in their own way yet they were also somewhat insignificant to the main plot that they could of all been introduced right before the main fight scene, like Spidey, to do their dirt really. The business side of this movie was evident that they just wanted more characters to push box office sales. Introducing black panther felt very ""thrown in there"" like. There was no mystery to it, just a ""hey, oh yeah Im now the King of Wakanda and Black Panther everyone."" I think his inaugural debut should have been an origin story seeing as though he is a lesser known hero in the MCU. Vision being in the movie made was a dud. He is far more powerful than he is made out and extremely under utilized when it comes to major threats against his allies, smh, and he misses his target like he isn't an advanced technological superhero. Did Iron Man really need to recruit a 16 year old to help out. Like where was MARK 50-100 right!? I could go on and on about unnecessary characters so back to the story. It was all over the place and you can tell that they picked and pulled from different decades of the original comics to make the story work for the movie, in which there isn't really a super villain....Zemo. It was like the Mandarin all over again in my opinion. That has to be the biggest upset in the story of all.

That being said there is very little else i can say that hasn't been done in every other Marvel film to date. Except in the last 2 minutes of the final battle i felt no character was in any danger at all. Its like WWE, you know everything will be OK in the end. Both leads are brilliant as always the supporting cast was brilliant and the new comers were very good. I cant seem to shake this feeling of I've seen it all before and the knowledge that Disney is hyping this into a masterpiece when its just a rehash of a rehash. To avoid spoilers its limiting me to what i can say all i can say is its standard Marvel, forgettable villain,lots of mid fight quips and no sense of danger at all.

","Enjoyed the film, although it wasn't particularly a stand-out. Action was decent though pacing erred in places; storyline was mediocre, overstuffed and all over the place; Evans was rather plastic. Downey Jr's acting was fantastic despite the poor choice made for the direction of his character. Hawkeye and Spider-Man had no place in the film; felt like the Russos were shoehorned into having Spider-Man in the film for marketing purposes. Chadwick Boseman was interesting on debut and was a good pick for Black Panther. Good to see Vision and Scarlett Witch finally get some much-needed character development, even if it was minor. Once again, we see a MCU edition with no real consequences. The story seemed way too forced. Bruhl was another missed opportunity by Marvel for a great villain, though that is the story's fault, not his acting.

","Firstly, you need to know that I'm a fan of Marvel, because they have unique characters and what I like the most is, that all meet each other in the end. Some earlier, some later. So they created a whole new universe which is incredible. Although they started mixing heroes together with the Avengers movies, they continued here with putting for example Ant-Man, Spiderman and the new hero Black Panther in. But now to the movie itself: I'm also a fan of dramatically scenes and obviously the movie had a lot in it and I'm #TeamIronMan, because Stark's kinda right about the whole situation and tried to get the best for the team and Cap shouldn't have that over reacted, but that's just my opinion. I also loved Starks Suit, it was really well done by the special effects team. I wished, he'd had this suit in Spiderman Homecoming or Infinity War, but unfortunately it got destroyed by Cap. Also the story line is really good in my opinion and it makes it even more interesting to see Infinity War, because they need to re-unite first before they can defeat Thanos.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

","The Captain America movie franchise has come a long way. Ever since Winter Soldier, when you first notice a change in the delivery pattern. It was now Cap 2.0. The actions were how you would imagine a superhuman would fight. With Civil War, it maintained that same tone and vigor. It was a fun ride to get hyped together with the internet with those memes speculating on how the war would broke out between Cap and Iron Man and when you finally get to hear the real reason on screen, I was like ""Ohh, okay... I am feeling this"". You understand what those characters were defending, it was not just out of greed, pride or for their personal gain but from what they, as their own experience and sense of honour and justice feel and they hold on to that and thus the dispute. Black Panther was so good. While watching the movie with my brother, I keep telling him ""Oh man, can you believe this, that's Black Panther, that's him, they nailed it"". He was my absolutely favourite. Chadwick Boseman was phenomenally perfect in that role, marvelous casting there. And coming to Spiderman, I know a lot of people out there said this before and I will say it as well, 'BEST SPIDERMAN EVER!'. He was great.

The destruction of previous movies are something which didn't go unnoticed and warranted the signing of the sokovia accords. This tries to establish the MCU as an universe where actions have consequences. at the same time no one seems to care that scarlet witch aided and abetted Ultron in the last film.

","This film was fun. Now, I know that doesn't sound amazing. And it's not. It's not amazing. There are flaws. Plenty of flaws. But you know what else there is? Fighting. A lot of fighting. Way too much maybe, I mean damn. You got... you got Spiderman, right? Spiderman's hanging off War Machine and... and then Ant-Man goes giant or whatever and... like... um... Black Panther, y'know? He stabs people and jumps from car to car... and the Winter Soldier, like, gets on a motorcycle while it's going... and Captain America holds a helicopter... and... and... yeah. God, this film was fun. Of course, the fun factor can only get you thus far. I mean, sure, it was well written (dialogue wise), well choreographed and it had Spiderman flying around Giant Man like-- sorry, sorry, got a bit excited there. Alright, so... what does this film do wrong? Well, it has a lot to juggle. You got way too many characters, way too many plot points and it gets weird. It does the best it can with the 56+ characters it has, introduces a new villain, and has a big manly testosterone man fight. And the intro sequence is very fun, too. But some of the characters feel off, considering the dark tone of the film, which, by the way, was WAAAAY better than Batman V. Superman (Aaaaand there's the obligatory jab at Batman V. Superman), characters like Ant-Man. Why in the hell does Ant-Man join Cap's team? Why does Iron-Man need Spidey for? He's got Vision in his team. Goddamn Vision, dude, the guy can fly, shoot lasers and go through walls. And maybe read minds, I'm not sure. And there's the villain, which comic readers will immediately recognize, but they seem underdeveloped to any casual moviegoer. Because they are. There really wasn't much time devoted to them with all the stuff going on. Hell, there wasn't even a big bad fight scene. Besides Loki (who wasn't that great in the first place) the Marvel movie villains haven't been that great. Most of them were guys in a business suit (Iron Man 1, 2, 3, Winter Soldier, Ant Man) and Ultron, who was pretty stupid as well. The big point of this film, the reason behind the ""Civil War"" (odd way of saying it, they kick each other in the face for fifteen minutes. Kinda like how the Age Of Ultron lasted like, what, a week? A couple of days?) is this discussion. Or at least, that's what they lead you to believe in the trailers. No, the reason why they fight is much different, the Hero Registration Act or whatever it's called kinda stays in the background. And there is a lot to discuss there. Stark says the Avengers need to be put in check. And they do. They can't just run around like they own the world. However, had the Avengers not been there the last three times, way more people would've died. It's an annoying discussion. The characters fighting feels rushed, too. Maybe if they sat down and talked it out they'd fix it in 20 minutes. Without broken bones. Especially in the final fight. Also, is the Winter Soldier really compelling enough to make two movies focusing on him? Overall, the good outweighed the bad. There was still bad in there, don't get me wrong, but I'm not grouchy enough to let that get in the way of Black Widow kicking people in the balls.

The story is very good. It keeps the essence of the comic book story line but makes the necessary changes to it. In the comic book story it was easier to pick a side as Iron Man was almost shown as a villain. Here it is not the case. We see both sides of the argument in a very meaningful way. So even though I was #TeamCap I could see Iron Man's point of view and understand where he is coming from. It is true for every character. There are so many characters but every character gets their moment to shine in the movie. The movie is mostly serious in tone but there are many humorous moments as well and all of them are done brilliantly. Spider Man is finally in the MCU! And he is great. His scenes are amazing and are among the several high points of the movie. The other big character introduced is Black Panther and he is awesome in the movie.

It made over a billion dollars and is the 6th all time grossing movie. Clearly it was fantastic. If not, then why did it make so much money? It was fun, exciting, and had a fantastic plot. Watch it again and maybe you'll see how great it is. 10/10! I can't wait to see what's next in the marvel cinematic universe. Where will the heroes go from here? Thanos is coming and it's going to be crazy insane. Will Ant-Man be giant again? Will Bucky show up in Black Panther? Will Cap get a new shield? So many questions to ask and little answers for now.

","Pretty good movie, although achingly cheesy at times. The only thing that i will truly say is that every single avenger character was in this movie, it felt more like it was focused around the whole squad instead of simply him. Are all of marvels movies going to have avenger characters in them now??? I get having to include them here and there but this movie was so similar to any other avenger movie that captain America just got lost in the jumble. Also with everything happening in the avengers series i feel like the writers are feeling compelled to keep them together. The timelines are also starting to get confusing and mixed up (i.e. X- Men), don't get me wrong i love the avengers series but i kind of feel like them creating it was detrimental to every other movie series they are now coming out with.

","I wanted to love this movie so much, when it ended I liked it, thats about it. I personally prefer story over action, and this movie is mostly just action scenes. Don't get me wrong! The action scenes were amazing! But that is about it... The story was so simple. ""I'm mad at you."" ""Well, I'm mad at you too, lets fight."" Whenever the characters were talking instead of fighting, it was just the same argument every time. The film had weak dialogue but made up for it in action. Black Widow seems to be more of badass in every movie. I found myself wishing Scarlett Witch would go away every time I saw her on screenI loved the new Spidey, but Black Panther stole the whole movie for me. I was clapping and cheering every time he showed up on screen. Baron Zemo was yet again another waste of a potentially great villain. Overall, I enjoyed the action but it did not live up to my hype and it is very far from a favorite in the Marvel series.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

","Civil War is a brilliantly crafted, action packed, full of story, fun- fest with deeper meaning. The movie didn't include as much humor as put into most Marvel movies, which I personally feel is right. The jokes weren't rushed and they were really funny. All the heroes got fair screen-time, not as so as Ant-Man, but later in the movie they made up for Ant-Man's missing screen-time for almost half the movie. Spider-Man was amazing, quippy, clever, and spectacular. There were some scenes where he doesn't look entirely real, and more on the CGI side, but I didn't mind it at all. There are many twists, and things you don't see coming, but it's very enjoyable. The last quarter-ish, it get's a little dark, and I loved it. I will definitely be watching it again, and buying it when it comes out on DVD/Digital/Blu-Ray.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

","This film is a masterpiece in super hero genre. Almost every character there was well constructed. The film is well paced, the action scenes were great, the story was simple yet well presented. Even when Spider Man was introduced it didn't ruin the film's pacing or made his insertion seem forced. Black Panther may be a bit of a disappointment in the beginning but as the character develops he gets much better and matures more than Tony Stark. The villain? He wasn't even necessary, and yet did what he had to do. Some of the characters question the whole new law thing and start thinking about their actions in recent events. It's not like the comics, but for me it seems that the director and the script writer did everything they could with the resources they had. I know that giving it a 10 may be a bit of an exaggeration for some people because there are better films than this one, but for me in the super hero genre this one is the best so far.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

","The King T' Chaka is speaking Zulu to his son. If you want to make up a fake country and use any African dialect or a made up one sure, go ahead, but we love Marvel also and you owe it to African viewers to be authentic. If you hire a South African actor, good for you but he has to speak a Nigerian dialect or then change the name of the country he is representing. You have producers you pay for that reason! But the Hollywood idea of thinking only of American viewers who see ""other languages"" as gibberish is offensive to us who understand and pay money only to see have our cultures misrepresented. Hollywood has produced quite a few movies with African actors speaking different languages and pretending to be having a conversation. Yes, its acting!

","People were hyping the crap out of tho movie, so I figured I'd go see it today. Long story short, this was the first time I actually got bored at the theater. The 3D was good, the action sequences were pretty cool, and the camera-work includes some neat shots. Where Civil War falls short is an extremely boring first half. The payoff is good towards the second half with spiderman and more action, but the story gets derailed and all over the place. Not only is the story confusing and all over the place, the many slow parts of the movie just made things boring. I mean REALLY slow parts. The villain is a Russian guy apparently and not at all important to the movie, only appearing for about 10 minutes and not showing any real significance. Speaking of which, no characters showed any significance besides iron man, despite being called captain America. Had this just been Avengers 3, it might have made more sense. Captain America was there, but most of the focus was on iron man and every other character felt like cameos besides bucky and captain America. I had to give this a 6 though, because even though there are some seriously slow parts and plot holes abundant, plus an odd choice of casting (why is aunt may like 35 years old?), the film has good action and I really liked spiderman and black panthers appearances, as they really added some weight to the movie.",/review/rw3470064/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_Civil_War_2016

Why just make avenger fight each other? if he was not able to beat the avenger, why not use a super soldier?
