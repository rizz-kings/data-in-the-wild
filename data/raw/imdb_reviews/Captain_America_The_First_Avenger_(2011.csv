","Essentially an origin story, this was exactly how I remembered reading the Captain America comic books when I was younger, mostly sticking around how the sickly Steve Rogers (a CG- ed Chris Evans) became the beefcake he was through a top secret military experiment, and his constant battles with his arch nemesis standing for all things Axis powered personified by the Red Skull, played to perfection by Hugo Weaving with a German accented voice as the Johann Schmidt version. At its heart it's a clear cut battle between good and evil, although in this Marvel augmented reality, Evil is aided by the powers of the Cosmic Cube and the megalomaniacal ambitions of Red Skull and his Hydra shock troops, threatening to conquer the globe unless someone can do something about it.",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

","Considering how fundamentally 'safe' the superhero action film has become in terms of box office and reasonable standards of entertainment, selling Captain America, age-old icon of American propaganda on cinema screens in cynical and economically unstable times could hardly have been a more difficult endeavor – tellingly, the film was marketed simply as The First Avenger in Russia, the Ukraine and South Korea. Indeed, skepticism and uncertainty have riddled the development of the project, which was first pitched as a Jon Favreau ""action comedy"" and later as a brutal, gritty, self-critical postmodern war epic. Such tonal fluctuation mirroring the social/political climate demonstrated that having a successful film with such a politically entwined protagonist, was anything but 'safe' – it's hard to imagine Peter Parker being subjected to the scrutiny of ""military propaganda"" or ""patriotic cheese"" that beset Steve Rogers.

Meanwhile evil Nazi Hugo Weaving believing he is Darth Maul, has his own plans for world conquest using sharks with frickin' laser beams. (Just kidding about the sharks.) Rogers is a 90 pound weakling who displays intellect, courage, and guts. He is selected for the military's secret program and is transformed into a muscular super hero. The special effects were very good, although we do know from ""Last Action Hero"" you can't really jump around car roofs.

","In preparation for its 'Avengers' who assemble next year, Marvel Comics ends the super- heroes showdown this year with its final prequel about the origins of 'Captain America' – the leader of the Avengers. Unlike the hi-tech flamboyance of 'Ironman', the might and super power of 'Thor' and the destructive temper of 'The Incredible Hulk', Captain America has little to offer but his devout patriotism and impenetrable shield as a hero. However, what makes him the captain, is the quintessential quality of compassion within the weakling Steve Rogers, that values both strength and power. After shrinking the kids, playing a live board game, recalling dinosaurs and creating werewolves in his movies, director Joe Johnston takes us back to the World War II era when in the midst of the Nazi turmoil, a country sent its troops to war with one hero, who would save the day for America.

","There's an air of genial and gentle good humor pervading the early scenes in ""Captain America"" whereby we're treated to the scenes involving the scrawny but scrappy young man Steve Rogers before his body transformation into the title hero makes him look like he stepped out of a recruiting poster. And this combination of humor and charm continues even as the tale becomes full of the revenge motif once our hero embarks on his more dangerous course as the man who must fight his nemesis, The Red Skull, rescuing the world as well as his good buddy from enemy hands.

","""Rocketeer"" director Joe Johnston's ""Captain America"" amounts to a timeless David versus Goliath tale set in the Marvel Comics' universe where good always trumps evil. Unlike ""Thor"" and ""Green Lantern,"" ""Captain America"" ranks as a thoroughly spectacular but larger-than-life extravaganza with a genuinely charismatic hero struggling against a marvelously malignant villain. Chris Evans' engaging performance as the 'First Avenger' is something else, too! If you recall, Evans had the time of his life several years ago playing egotistical Johnny Storm, aka 'the Human Torch,' in the two ""Fantastic Four"" flicks. Make no mistake; Evans is nothing like he was in those two super heroic sagas. Indeed, ""Captain America"" boasts some amazing special effects, but its best special effect is the sincerity that Evans brings to the role of Steve Rogers. Whether he plays Rogers as either a scrawny, 98-pound zero or a brawny, fleet-footed hero, Evans imparts heart to this $140-million thriller. During the first half of ""Captain America,"" Johnston gradually builds the momentum to let us grow accustomed to Evans as a scrappy little fellow who suffers the wrath of bullies. This pathetic weakling refuses to let anybody keep him down, and it's fun because Evans makes it look so authentic despite the obvious CGI effects. Hugo Weaving registers as the ideal villain who holds the upper hand throughout most of the supercharged shenanigans.

This plan got off to a hugely successful start with 2008's IRON MAN (9/10) and a decent reboot of THE INCREDIBLE HULK (7/10) later that same year, and started picking up steam when 2010's IRON MAN 2 (8/10) brought War Machine and Black Widow into the picture.

23,24 July 2011,jonnyhavey,," America's Underdog: Retrofied and Wow-Factor-Free
","This is the first ""Avengers'"" film from Marvel's contemporary franchise that puts aside imprudent jokes and replaces them with retrofied art direction and an old-fashioned superhero scheme powered by superbly written characters. However, while ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" avoids being classically campy, it falls short of being great with its lack of a wow-factor. Therefore, the film wields a double-edged sword tapping into new comic adaptation ground, but still suffering from clichés and an underwhelming predictable end of the world plot. Consequently, the real triumph in the film comes from Chris Evans's (""Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World"") portrayal of Steve Rogers. He becomes a star straying away from his arrogant roots; instead embodying a meek, courageous, man aspiring to serve in the U.S. army in World War II. After Rogers was rejected from the service numerous times because of his small stature and health issues, Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci, ""Easy A"") sees his valor. Erskine then offers Rogers a chance of a lifetime allowing him to join the army under the command of Colonel Chester Phillips's (Tommy Lee Jones, ""No Country for Old Men""). The Colonel begins to doubt Erskine's decision, but Rogers's courage allows him to transform into America's hero with the help of Howard Stark's (Dominic Cooper, ""An Education"") technology. Now Captain ""Rogers"" America must lead a group of soldiers on a quest to kill a Nazi named Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving, ""Lord of the Rings"") who delves into a mystic power changing himself into the infamous Red Skull.",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

Captain America is better and that is not taking anything away from Iron Man. Yes, still some aspects of the story was changed, but I felt this was a great translation that captured and added to Captain America. They handled the background story and cast of characters with intelligence. I think the original intent of Captain America's creator comes through and what his values were.

","Another perk of serving our country... an advance screening of a great film! Intelligent comic-book popcorn epics are rare and this one is definitely a cut above the usual fare. Besides being a tremendously smart and even emotional film, it's also refreshing to see a lead hero be just that... a hero. Steve is no morbid vigilante or narcissistic self absorbed anti-hero. He's the real deal. His tough life hasn't made him bitter or jaded. In fact, it's done just the opposite. He's needed to develop character because his body didn't develop. This is the key to Cap both in the books and in the film. Heart and character trump the physical elements and are what truly makes the character itself special. Even after he's given the great gift of being a ""super soldier,"" he still continues to do the right thing. It's not to prove anything to anyone other than himself because he has a high moral code. I love the fact that they choose his character for the experiment because he wouldn't take advantage of the gift. That's smart writing. Cap's first assignment from the U.S. government is to be the centerpiece in a traveling USO show, building morale and raising money for the war effort. Eventually, he finds he's wasting his new abilities and NEEDS to break away on his own to fight the Nazi menace. This brings him to conflict with the awesomely diabolical Red Skull. The Skull is one of Marvel's best crazed villains and they captured that perfectly. Here, the Red Skull was a guinea pig for a similar Nazi super soldier experiment that went very wrong. These clashes and confrontations are everything they should be and more. Shades of gray are great in film (and there are those tones present here) but sometimes it's good to have character of pure heart, pure integrity and true morality take it to what history and everyone knows was pure evil. It's refreshing to sit back and root for the ultimate good to take it to the ultimate bad guys.

45,4 August 2011,kevin-miller447,," The First Avenger ends the Avenger tie in movies nicely
","I knew nothing about Captain America prior to viewing this Marvel film. Many people were skeptical about Chris Evans being cast as the man in red, white, and blue mainly because he is previously known for playing Johnny Storm in the not so fantastic Fantastic Four movies. Despite, the fact that he had a lot of pressure going into this film, I thought he did a fare job. I personally don't think this was the best Avengers tie in movie but it was fine. The first half of the movie did a very good job of establishing the story behind the creation of this man and how he was initially just an experiment and then turned into a propaganda piece for the war in order to excite people and inspire them to fight the fight. Afterward, when he finally does take initiative and attempts to infiltrate and destroy the enemy, the movie turns into a pretty standard and generic action movie. Hugo Weaving is cast as the villain known in the comics as the Red Skull. Despite a good looking face (a red face), he never really becomes too menacing and isn't given enough screen time as the red skull to really effect us. Tommy Lee Jones is in his realm as an army commander who is in charge of operations including Rogers and is very funny as well as delivering the lines extremely well. Speaking of lines, this movie doesn't have the best or worst script and I think they (the writers) could have spent more time developing better dialogue that didn't sound so rushed. Director Joe Johnston who is know for The Rocketeer brings the 1940s World War feeling to the screen brilliantly and with great set designers and art direction. Tony Starks father plays a fairly significant role as the man behind the suit and weapons of the Captain. Played by Dominic Cooper, we get an inside look at how Stark got his attitude and knack for building new technology. The 3D added nothing, which is not unusual nowadays. The only time it was ever apparent was when the shield was thrown towards the screen which happened maybe twice. This movie does a nice job of finishing the tie in movie for the upcoming epic Avengers movie die to release next year. My only hope is that all of this build up with the individual super hero movies is not wasted. This is worth a rental and I will probably buy this on blu-ray when the price is greatly reduced.",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

","Captain America: The First Avenger is definitely up there with Iron Man as one of the greatest superhero origin stories ever told and it was done in fashion. Chris Evans as Steve Rogers/Captain America was born to play this role as a man who is smaller than most who just wants to serve and fight for his country, who is given the chance by a scientist to give him super powers that makes him become the ultimate soldier. Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes was one of my favorite castings of the film as Steve Rogers best friend who is also fighting the war alongside him. Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter was phenomenal in her own way as well while also forming her own relationship with Steve Rogers. Tommy Lee Jones as Col. Chester Phillips was great as well. Hugo Weaving as Red Skull was menacing. If I have any complaints, the CGI, compared to previous MCU films could have been better and I wished we would of gotten a little more of Steve's and Peggy's chemistry together. Overall, Captain America: The First Avenger is definitely one of the best superhero origin stories that has been told and also helped lead the MCU to forming the Avengers.

","After ""Hulk"", ""Iron Man"" and ""Thor"", this one is obviously a must-see as a pre-requisite to next year's major movie event: The Avengers. In what generally acknowledged as a more ""human"" story, the plot line follows the determined quest of titular protagonist Steve Rogers, a 90-pound weakling (miraculous CGI work on 6-foot Chris Evans) with Hercules-size heart and will-power, to get into the U.S. Army to serve his country in WW II. By a stroke of luck, his dream is fulfilled when he is chosen as an object of a scientific experiment through which he is transformed into not quite Superman, but certainly a man with above-human physical capabilities. Ironically, the ultimate role of this Captain America, as conceived by the authorities, is a ""chorus girl"" in a public relations and morale boosting road show. To cut a long story short, he finally achieves his goal, culminating in an epic dual with nemesis Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving), a German megalomaniac who seeks first to replace Hitler, then to rule the world. As expected, our hero wins, but not without cost. While fortunate to escape almost certain death, he ends up in a coma, only to wake up 70 years later, to find that he has missed a date with his love interest Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), British military agent with a face of an angel, fists of steel, and a heart that appears to be of the same stuff but actually has a soft spot in it. The cast is impressive. Evans handles well this meatier role after trivial pursuits like Human Torch. Those who ever doubt Atwell's acting ability show see ""Brideshead revisited"" (2008). Weaving appears in the first half of the movie in his familiar persona and look, and in the second half, while with persona intact, transforms into the hideous ""Red Skull"". Tommy Lee Jones, looking a little like Bob DeNiro, serves well as the typical army man. Stanley Tucci has a cameo-type appearance as the scientist who discovers Rogers. And there is of course Samuel L. Jackson who appears in his now customary Nick Fury cameo, linking all the component movies of ""The Avengers"".",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

","I was getting a bit weary of the Marvel super hero stories, but I understand that it is a necessity to introduce this younger movie going generation to them, in anticipation of the upcoming Avengers. To my surprise the film Captain America: The First Avenger was actually quite good. I love the Where's Waldo Stan Lee game we play with each of these Marvel movies. I believe that Mr. Lee has had a cameo in all the films, which is a really nice touch to honor the creator of all these rich comic book characters. I thought from the trailer that this would be another World War II movie, with a twist to the Nazi story, delving into a more colorful fantasy than what was the horrific reality of that war. In fact this film, in telling the Stephen Rogers (Chris Evans) back story gives us a really cool look at the fifties attire, automobiles and how the general public was entertained. We see that the senior Stark, Howard (Dominic Cooper) is a bit of a showoff, like father like son and a technological genius, again like father like son, so some of the weaponry as seen in the Iron Man films when Stark junior has taken over is way more advanced than at all possible. But all the weapons and visuals had a very authentic historical look about them. The one thing that I noticed that was a complete deviation from true history, was that no one in the entire film was shown smoking. We see smoking guns, smoking trains, smoking buildings, but not a single solitary smoking person. In the Fifties EVERYBODY, not just everything smoked. It was amusing to me whenever Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) addressed anyone, I kept thinking Agent K, has used an alien time travel machine and came to WWII to command. And speaking of agents, I am always in favor of a strong female role. Agent Carter (Hayley Atwell) was truly a bright spot in this film, I wanted to see more of a progression of her relationship with Captain America, but there's just never enough time. The special effects were palpable, the pace of the story kept my interest and the warring elements were not so graphic that I was flinching at gore. All in all it was a good action adventure and gets us one step closer to the Avengers. I give it a green light. - Emma Dinkins",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

Steve rogers (chris Evans) is a 98 pound weakling trying to prove himself worthy of joining the army. he feels he has no right not to do what the brave men in war have done. which is fight for there country. finally a German scientist, who switched sides to the Americans gives rogers a chance to join the army and show the physicality isn't everything. there is also colonel chester Phillips played by Oscar winner tommy lee Jones. who did excellent in his role. anyway he stars out judging rogers because of his weight. and tells the Dr Abraham Erskine e who recruited rogers to the army that to be a soldier you need guts. so to prove that Phillips throws a grenade to the team while there doing jumping jacks and everyone scatters. everyone but rogers. rogers runs and lays over the grenade. it doesn't go off, and Phillips says to Abraham ""he's still skinny"". always love watching tommy lee Jones in his movies. especially this one. tommy lee Jones was excellent in this movie. there is also Peggy carter (hayley atwell) who is the love interest in the film. she liked rogers even before he became all muscular. with the help of Howard stark (iron mans father) Abraham makes Steve rogers a super soldier. it was a fun movie to watch and there was a lot of comedy. the funniest scene to me is were rogers, Phillips, and Peggy are in a car after Schmidt and as he's about to jump out of the car Peggy kisses rogers. then rogers looks at Phillips who has a change of heart in rogers and grows to like rogers a lot and as rogers looks at Phillips, Phillips turns to rogers and say ""im not kissing you"". brilliant and funny scene. i strongly suggest you see this film. its a great lead up to the avengers and gets you even more excited to see the film, especially at the end where nick fury shows up. i think we all know what he wants from captain America/Steve rogers. anyway great film, and any superhero fan will enjoy it.",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

","To be very honest, when I saw the trailers of this movie, I felt it wouldn't do the job right.

Every comic book fan knows his amazing shield and that virtually nothing can stop the hero when he has it with him. And this is why I was afraid. Once someone would take the idea and make it into a movie, that was it. There would be no ""revised versions"" or anything of the sort. There could be new versions but that would have to be years from now. You wouldn't want a movie like this to go wrong. I saw the trailers and I felt that that was exactly what was going to happen. The great name of Captain America would be ruined by a bad movie. I researched a little bit more to find who the director was and my fears grew stronger. Joe Johnston, the man who directed films like Jumanji, The Wolfman, and Jurassic Park 3? October Sky was good but that's a drama film.

I thought it was written to perfection, the way they took time to show his transformation from a scrawny guy to a huge muscular man, and all of the things that lead to him becoming Captain America like the 107th with Bucky going missing and Steve, against orders, went in all by himself to save them, and that is exactly what he did, he saved all of them, nearly 400, that is what lead him to becoming Captain America.

I love war movies, and to make it better, this one had the Marvel touch added to it. Just like always, Sarah Haley Finn did a lights out job casting this movie, she never disappoints, and the actors she casts, all play their roles perfectly. Lastly, the final battle was pretty amazing. I think it ties, if not surpasses Iron Man 2's final battle.

","Captain America: First Avenger is the fifth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Its serves somewhat as a prequel. This film is not to be confused with the 1990 film Captain America, or the two Captain America TV movies from the 1970s, or the classic movie serials from the 1940s, all of which have no relation to this film, aside from being based on the same comic book character. Comic books such as the movie's source material, the original Captain America #1, gained immense popularity during World War II as cheap, portable, and easily read tales. Most of them, were about superheroes batting the Axis Powers. This movie is paying homage to those early comics! It has adventure mixes patriotism, and explosive action. Directed by Joe Johnston, First Avenger tells the story of US Army reject Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), who volunteers for a secret government program which transforms him into the world's first super soldier. As Captain America, Rogers goes to war against Nazi Germany's military forces — including HYDRA division, Johann Schmidt AKA Red Skull (Hugo Weaving), who has his own plans for world domination. Without spoiling the movie, too much, the movie is fun to watch, but somewhat dated. There was nothing new to be found. Honestly, I was hoping for a more Indiana Jones type story, here, but the movie doesn't have much depth. The story felt a little one-dimension. It didn't even bother explaining what the Tesseract McGuffin does. The movie kinda forces it's viewers to do some research, coming in. It's like the movie is imposing you to see Marvel's previous film, 2011's Thor, so you wouldn't get lost. That's not right. The movie could have, so much more, explaining than it gave on its own. There were a lot of odd plot-holes, and misdirection. I wish, the movie focus more on the super soldier formula, more than the Tesseract. It kinda pull the plot, apart. Honestly, I have no idea why the German try to steal the super soldier formula, if weren't going to use it. The super soldier formula never pay off, in the film as it rarely mention beyond the first act. Also, I still have no idea, why Steve Rogers was put on USO duties for so long. It's really strange. Why didn't the military use Captain America, better? It's like having an Atom Bomb and instead of using it, Harry Thurman sent Enola Gay to do airshows for the public for War Bonds. It doesn't make sense!?! Even in comic book terms. It's also very bizarre, how many years, it takes for Red Skull is bomb, America. It's like the villains were wasting time! They had plenty of time, to build it! Way, before Steve Rogers show up, and destroyed all their production factories. For villains with a powerful superweapon, they were very underdeveloped. Red Skull spends more time building his death plane and reminding us how evil he is, rather than, showing that he can be a true threat for Captain America. No wonder, why Nazi Germany lose the war. Even, the climax was a bit confusing; they never did make a good account on how Captain America reach the present day. If the director and the script took more chances with the material, Marvel could have had their best movie ever. Instead, they have an alright film. While, the story is pretty mediocre. I have to say, the movie had some good set pieces. While, I got the sense that I was in the 1940s, the technology for the film didn't match up, historical. It was a bit jarring. I guess, they were going for a World War Sci-Fi Futurama feel. The action is a bit unrealistic at times, but it's somewhat entertaining. The CGI stunt work was alright; but I was hoping for more real stunt work. I love the way, the movie photo shop and use visual effects to transform Chris Evan's buff body to make him, look like a small skinny weakling. That's really amazing! Mad props to those guys! I have to give, Chris Evans, some credit for having a well tone body as well. He looks the part. What I like about Chris Evans's performance of Steve Rogers was that he didn't come off with the same attitude and cockiest of his previous role as the Human Torch in 2005's Fantastic Four. Still, the movie didn't take any significant creative risk with any of the movie characters. Captain America is a plain old boy-scout. Red Skull is over the top plain evil. The supporting characters are worse, the lovely-and-capable Agent Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), and James 'Bucky' Barnes (Sebastian Stan) had little to no chemistry with Steve Rogers. I really didn't buy them, being Roger's love interest and Cap's best friend. Both of the actors, acting was a bit off-putting here. One of the film's highlights are the Howling Commandos, a group of ragtag soldiers whom Cap breaks out of a POW camp. They honestly deserve their own movie, rather than extended cameos, here. Having big names play Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) & Col. Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) was kinda a mistake, as they somewhat overshadow, the other supporting characters, due to how well- their acting was. While, the overall acting was meh, Captain America soundtrack was booming. I love the score by composter, Alan Silvestri. It really capture the over the top, superhero feel, without going all broody and dark. It's remind me so much of the original 1978's Superman main theme song. One thing that I love about the movie is the musical number, 'Star Spangled Man With a Plan'. This song would get me to buy war bonds. It was so catchy. One thing, missing in the film was humor. The movie was very lackluster when it comes to that. Overall: Captain America is like a firework. It's has explodes, but in the long run, it's get kinda smoky and unclear.

","During World War II, Steve Rogers is turned down for military service due to being about a third the size of a usual adult male, but he gets a chance to fulfill his dream of serving(this is surprisingly enough not as jingoistic and blindly nationalist as you might think, it pokes fun at that, with propaganda pieces and being more about real patriotism, courage and wanting peace) when he gets to test out a super soldier serum(try saying that three times fast). Meanwhile, The Red Skull has plans for the future of the world that need to stopped. The characters tend to be memorable, the supporting cast really adding. We have Tony Stark's father Howard who's the good guys' team's tech guy and just as careless as his son, a strong female agent who fought her way to her rank and Tommy Lee Jones playing himself and being the biggest badass in the entire thing(impressive, when you consider that he looks roughly 180 years old in this), and delivers every line of his perfectly(he could do it in his sleep, and possibly did, and it's still incredible). The acting is great for all concerned(who didn't know that Weaving could play a fantastic villain? And the nuance(same with the colors on our titular hero's costume) is well-chosen, it doesn't feel silly, and it seems like it's make-up, it follows his facial movements), and most of the dialog is, as well, with a lot of funny, natural and quotable lines. A lot of time passes before the action kicks in, at which point there is plenty of it and it's nearly all fun and effective. The look is remarkably well-done, sepia, art deco and really makes you believe that we're seeing the 40's. Cap fights(with his every punch launching people flying) Hydra(not Nazis... is this what political correctness has come to?), and they have awesomely designed suits and weapons powered by an amazing energy source. The 3D is seldom obtrusive, and it's done really well. This relates very directly to Iron Man 2 and Thor(You'll appreciate it more if you've watched those), and sets up The Avengers. While I'm not sure, I think this follows the comic book pretty well. I recommend this to any fan of Captain America. 8/10",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

The main problem with the film is that it is so well done at first, the second half almost seems a bit rushed. Not bad mind you, just like they were running out of time or something. That being said it did have a really cool battle between hero and villain at the end. This would be the fifth and final Marvel film leading up to the Avengers and basically where Disney took over pretty much all the Marvel films.

","I love superhero movies when they are done right, and Captain America is one of the better ones I've seen recently and a big improvement over the 1990 film. Is it perfect? No. Entertaining? Yes, I think so. It is a very well made and efficiently directed film, with wonderful costumes, effects and settings and the cinematography and editing also impress. The music is rousing, and I just love Star Spangled Man, one of Alan Menken's best songs in my opinion. The script is witty and smart. Cheesy also? Perhaps but in an endearing sort of way. The story has a strong start, but loses its way to sluggish pacing and clichés in the final act. The characters are clichéd too in a sense but like the actors are engaging. Chris Evans is perfect in the title role, and he is joined by sassy Hayley Atwell and a wonderfully gruff Tommy Lee Jones. Hugo Weaving wasn't quite there for me, he is a great actor and he is charismatic and menacing, but his accent is inconsistent and the character could have been delved into more.

","I separate this movie into to parts, the first and second half. The first being my personal favourite of the two with the most character development, main plot of the story and best dialogue. The second half being straight and fun action. The character that is Steve Rogers is by far the highlight of the movie, he is so courageous despite all his many flaws and continues to overcome his seemingly limitless barriers. It is wonderful to watch how he uses his new strength to fight his enemies and help his allies. Speaking of his enemies, red skull isn't portrayed extremely well, his is shown as a crazed man with a god complex, no other development or back story is given to the character, you could argue that it isn't really needed though. The introduction to Bucky Barnes's character is quite small but obviously leads to more later in his character arc. Besides this I don't have much else to say besides the action towards the end is quite good, a little drawn out a little silly and over the top but intense and enjoyable to watch. Also the soundtrack is incredible, it fits extremely nicely and is very uplifting. Also Also the comedy in the movie, which there is few, is far better than I remember and isn't just thrown in at the most random places.

","What I like about Marvel's superhero movies is that they all have a unique tone and feel. Where something like Green Lantern (I can't help but compare the two movies since I've watched them only a day apart), despite it's extraterrestrial scope, it feels so generic. It doesn't play up its strengths or use its unique mythos to its advantage. On the other hand, the Iron Man, Thor and Captain America (and to use a DC example, Batman) movies feel completely different from each other. And that's a good thing, because with the many superheroes crowding the big screen these days, they have to have something to offer to make them worth the time and money. ",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

","So, after spending the last month watching the previous films that depicted Captain America in live action, I finally watched this latest one in 3-D with my movie theatre-working friend and I have to say right now, this was the most awesome of them all! I mean, finally, they get it right in having the true origin of how Steve Rogers went from a skinny weakling classified as 4-F to one becoming 1-A because of a scientist named Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) showing an interest in him. Those scenes with Tucci and Chris Evans as the eventual superhero bring gravitas to what makes Cap such a great patriot. Also great are the supporting cast of Tommy Lee Jones as the doubting Colonel Chester Phillips and Hayley Atwell as Agent Peggy Carter whose spunk and looks make her one of the most alluring leading ladies in these comic book superhero-based movies. Then there's Hugo Weaving as the great villain Johann Schmidt a.k.a The Red Skull. He's sure a hell of a lot more menacing than the one depicted in the 1990 Captain America, that's for sure! If there's one disappointment, it's that while there's a Bucky at last in one of these CA movie adaptations, he's not a teenage boy and he doesn't even wear the costume associated with him. Instead, he's just an enlisted friend about Steve's age who happens to travel with him when they go on missions. Though at least there's still enough of a friendship between them that we get it when Steve tries to drown himself in drink after James Buchanan Barnes (Sebastian Stan) falls off. And I also believed in the almost-relationship between Steve and Peggy. And most of the action scenes were great especially Cap's chase with a stolen taxi. And how about those humorous touches like Steve's shilling for war bonds with dancing girls and ""Adolf Hitler"" in tow?

Just because a character is out of a comic book does not mean that character should be treated as a caricature. This movie is set during a time of great and momentous change. That does not mean the movie is poorly crafted, rather it means that their is paucity of content as the director opted to dazzle the audience with special effects to keep the audience's attention.

","The film that could have been one of the worst by Marvel Studios instead turned out to be one of the best. Captain America: The First Avenger gets everything right, but the studio hasn't really released a bad film yet. Chris Evans as Steve Rogers is pretty much perfect here. He's believable as someone who goes through a big transformation, but more importantly he's believable as a righteous sickly young man who wants to serve his country. He's transformed into the super soldier Captain America, and he gets a good-looking costume which looks perfect for its era. The 1940s in this film is an optimistic retro-futuristic time that's important in world history. Director Joe Johnston (The Rocketeer, Jumanji) captured that era very well. The talented supporting cast includes Tommy Lee Jones, Hugo Weaving, Hayley Atwell, Sebastian Stan, Dominic Cooper and Stanley Tucci. Jones is great as usual in the role of Colonel Chester Phillips. Tucci gives an interesting performance as the deeply humanistic Dr. Abraham Erskine. And Atwell as the tough Peggy Carter looks just like one of those pin-up girls of the 1940s. Captain America: The First Avenger is an action-packed summer blockbuster, so there isn't a dull moment. One of the highlights is a motorcycle chase reminiscent of the one in Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade (1989). But there's still a good deal of drama, and the film takes an honest look at its hero. Even though the Nazis, or more precisely the terrorist organization HYDRA, have things like laser weapons this still seems perfectly believable. Some people might interpret the film as a piece of American propaganda, but I don't care because it's an exuberant great-looking superhero film. For some reason Captain America has always been one of my favorite superheroes (maybe it's the cool costume and shield), and I'm glad that now there's finally a good film about him.

","Here it is: the final ingredient for Marvel Studios' ambitious Avengers crossover film in the summer of 2012. Honestly, I wasn't all that excited in the months leading up to Captain America's big budget induction into Marvel's film canon for a few reasons. When I'd originally read that director Joe Johnston would be stepping in to helm the film, my mind kept going back to JURASSIC PARK 3 and how it had tainted a fun franchise. Combine that with the fact that I've never been a die-hard Captain America fan and the knowledge that the filmmaker's were going to have a lot of story on their hands if they wanted to bring the Captain America story to the point where he's ready for an Avengers crossover (covering his origins, his time in WWII, his arrival in contemporary times, etc.) in one film; I had severe doubts going in. For the non-Marvel fans, Captain America tells the story of Steve Rogers, a young man desperate to enlist in the military and fight for his country in World War II. Unfortunately he's got a list of physical problems that more than ensure he'll never see combat; that is, until he's approached by Dr. Abraham Erskine who wishes to test a new serum on Rogers. The procedure turns Rogers from a scrawny weakling into a super soldier and he becomes America's hero. As Captain America, it becomes apparent that he might be the country's only real hope against the forces of HYDRA and it's leader, the Red Skull.",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

","Captain America: The First Avenger (2011, Joe Johnston)
With this movie dropping in July of 2011 the MCU finally gets the last of the major players on the board in their own film prior to 2012's Avengers team up extravaganza that would really cement the MCU as a force to be reckoned with. I was extremely interested to see if this film could succeed. I was never a very big Captain America comics guy, and I couldn't help but wonder in this day and age if you could reintroduce a character like Steve Rogers/Captain America and not make him seem too archaic and out of touch with modern society. Little did I know that Cap's brand of just genuine good guy patriotism was exactly what this world needed and winds up playing as an excellent counterpoint to the likes of Tony Stark and Thor. This is another of the MCU films that, it seems to me, like many people aren't very high on and I really don't know why. I found this a great film and an immensely enjoyable origin story. It does lack a bit in huge action set pieces but makes up for it in some good old fashioned story telling and it combines super hero movie elements along with war movie elements and the Nazi treasure hunting angle gives it a bit of an Indiana Jones vibe as well.",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

","After creating several other Avengers movies, such as The Hulk, Iron Man and Thor, it was finally time for creating a film about the beloved action hero, Captain America. And this one does not disappoint. We see the story of Steve Rogers, who has been constantly rejected by the army, finally getting the chance he deserves. I have to say, Chris Evans's leading performance is rock-solid, and the performances by Hayley Atwell, Tommy Lee Jones and Hugo Weaving are no disappointment either. The entire film's production is top-notch, ranging from excellent sound design to eye- popping visuals, to a solid film score by Alan Silvestri. Some of the action sequences feel a bit too comic book-ish in my opinion though, and at some point you feel like you're watching a trailer rather than an actual movie. But, nonetheless, at other times they are brilliantly executed and I have nothing to complain about. The driving force of this movie is not delivered trough action or CGI though, but trough the emotional connection between the characters, especially the one between Steve and Bucky, his friend. Anyway, I won't be spoiling anything, overall it's a very solid, humorous and action-packed superhero movie, and it's one of the best Marvel movies to date.

The use of CGI isn't even evident even though you know it's there it's really well hidden.

Still just average and not good enough that anything stuck in my head. The only things worth remembering are the training sequences in the military because they are really funny. The setting from 1940 or so in that direction is also well chosen. But once Steve becomes Captain America, the movie just sucks. From then on, many superhero films get really exciting, but from then on this film is just boring because the action is forgotten and the rest doesn't work either. Especially from the time you see Red Skull for the first time, the film only looks cruel and cheap animated. The film is on par with Captain Marvel or even Red Notice.

A great storyline, wonderful recreation of the 1940s, honorable characters, fun humor, nice cast of talented actors.

Or lets say with the world's first Avenger in the center of it all as Chris Evans' character also showed up in other recent Marvel movies. The cast includes many known names such as Tommy Lee Jones and Stanley Tucci, who are fun as always, especially in their scenes together. The main antagonist is played by Hugo Weaving who you certainly know from the Matrix trilogy. And if you take a look at some other cast members, you will find the likes of Hayley Atwell for example who got her own series afterward. In terms of the story, it is almost always entertaining and rarely just another generic superhero film. I liked how they emphasized the American military aspects, for example that we see the Captain attack with an army of soldiers and some are killed because this is war. It fit the character nicely unlike for example in the Avengers movie where he is a lone wolf character like the others. But back to this one here: There are moments like this like for example the TLJ steak scene (and I am saying this as a vegetarian) and many others like the brilliant ""Star Spangled Man with a Plan"" sequence that should have won a Best Song Oscar or how we see the Captain struggle to gain the forces' respect and support on one occasion especially.",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

The concept of a brave imp with a heart of gold being the center of a film is interesting. The only problem is that Steve Rogers is a less than nobody, a man of little to no value, until he's juiced up on sci-fi 'roids.

I suspect the latter is deliberate, as 'Captain America: The First Avenger' actually isn't a WWII movie: although Nazi Germany is referred to a few times at the beginning, Steve Rogers is basically portrayed as a young man desperate to serve his country in A War Overseas. And from about a third of the film onwards, the Third Reich, Hitler, the Axis powers, and the Allies' campaigns on various fronts simply aren't mentioned, and instead the narrative is exclusively about Cap and his band of elite commandos targeting the Hydra organisation.

","Well, my wife was out for the night so I thought I'd indulge myself with a big blockbuster super-hero flick. I'm much more of a DC than a Marvel fan, so Steve Rogers and his red white and blue alter-ego mean little to me, but that may have helped me enjoy the movie more, not trying to reference every character and scene back to the comic. As a movie, despite its being primarily set in World War II, it lacks the darkness and psychological depth of say Christopher Nolan's Batman and to be fair doesn't once threaten to go there. Thus most of the characters are very 2-dimensional, either very heroic or very evil and as you'd expect, a good portion of the running-time is given over to action sequences and while there's a smattering of humour throughout, I could have stood some more. The early, scene-setting section works the best I think, particularly the remarkable shrinking technology which reduces Chris Evans to a mere pipsqueak. Can it be a coincidence that another 98lb weakling who morphed into a fearless muscle-man, Charles Atlas, shared our hero's initials? To be fair, that's about as much depth, if that's the right word, as you get here. However the story zips along like a good comic should and the acting's okay too. Tommy Lee- Jones gets an easy pay-day as a sub-Patton crusty C.O. while Hayley Atwell does a nice all-action English rose. The Red Skull makes for a good villain, with Hugo Weaving hamming up it up convincingly as the other mad Nazi out to rule the world. I did find the tying-in of the film to the upcoming Avengers movie as blatant as Stan Lee's pointless cameo, but all-told this was an enjoyable if not exactly marvellous comic-strip outing, the better for its war-time setting.",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

For people like me that are a Marvel fan and specially a captain America fan this movie is a diamond. Personally I loved all the script, the set, the story, the great love story between Cap and Peggy and how they made Steve's personality. The script , all the dialogues between characters helps you get personally involved in all types of relationships between them, specially friendship and love. How they made Captain America personality is just so good , a man that went through tough times but never changed a thing of what's inside of him and always looking for the opportunity to defend his country even when he got rejected many times.

","It's the early 1940s and the United States military has employed all of its resources to try and bring about the downfall of the Nazi regime. Steve Rogers is a feeble but courageous young man from Brooklyn who's only goal in life is to join the military. Having been continually passed up for enlistment, he volunteers to become the first test subject of a ""super soldier"" program that grants him enhanced strength and ability. Not only does this boost the morale of his country, it also makes him the only suitable candidate to combat the Hydra--a scientific Nazi faction led by the maniacal and astonishingly powerful Red Skull. The latest comic book adaptation to be set in the Marvel universe has special effects to please the eye, a vivid sense of time and place, and the expected action scenes, but without a compelling story, a sense of wonder or excitement, or an effective climactic showdown, it feels like just another run-of-the-mill origin tale. Evans acquits himself well as the hero, and Jones provides some fun as his ornery commanding officer, but both Weaving and Atwell are underused as the villain and love interest.

","*WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* Captain America: The First Avenger is a fun movie with lots of action, and a touching story line. We as the audience grow to care about Steve Rogers because we see him as a guy who is down on his luck. That way, when he does become the superhero, we feel a sense of triumph, because we see this little guy becoming the ultimate fighting force for freedom. This is a common theme in superhero movies, but this movie nailed that perfectly. The choice to set this in the 1940's and show us Cap's golden years before he came to the modern day may have been a turn off for some, but I thought it was handled excellently. The fact that this guy really believes in the good o'l fashioned American ideals is hard to swallow for every character in this movie. And they play off of that really, really well. The final scene where Cap is forced to crash the plane and ultimately send himself into the present day is very tragic, and Peggy's reaction to hearing him die over the radio is heart- breaking. As I've already hinted, I think Chris Evans is really good as Captain America, and I think they handled his character next to perfectly. The supporting cast is great, we have Tommy Lee Jones, Hayley Atwell as Agent Carter, and Howard Stark. We also have a villain for parts of this movie: The Red Skull. I like Hugo Weaving's Red Skull, but I don't think they handled him all that well in the movie. The Red Skull should just be the anti-thesis of Captain America, and he is, but they don't ever really drive that point home. It's just there, and it doesn't really go anywhere. Really, he just feels like a generic Nazi super-villain with super- strength for Cap to fight. I still like the character, but I just have a few gripes with how he was handled, that's all. In the end, Captain America: The First Avenger is a good, fun movie, with a great cast, some great action, a great theme, a good tone, and a good story.",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

Having read these books in my youth, I was looking forward to see what they would do with it. I was very pleased that they did not try to inject an anti USA message here. This is a Good vs. Evil story as most comic books were. Having Tommy Lee Jones, and Hugo Weaving who brought their professionalism to this production certainly made the difference. Different film editing would have made this an Oscar contender for sure is the only weak point I could find. This film coming out when the ""Super Soldier"" programs that various governments are working on makes it timely and more believable. The Special Effects are not overdone they work well with the story and are done is such a way that enhances the story without taking it over to make up for a weak script or acting, not the case here. Very well done. Chris Evans did a wonderful job, and I look forward to more from him. The director Joe Johnson did an outstanding job with the screenplay. I look forward to see what comes next.",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

All 4 of the superhero films this year were a big risk, involving period pieces, sci-fi, or Norse mythology, and only Green Lantern failed to be great. Anyways, to a lot of people Captain America may seem like a joke. Over patriotic propaganda. Fortunately, the film realises this and plays off it. Once Rogers becomes a superhero, he is simply used to sell war bonds. He's popular with the kids, but a joke to soldiers everywhere. Evans gives an excellent performance as a kid just wanting to do the right thing. He doesn't want to kill Nazis, he just hates bullies. Everything comes together to work in Captain America. Cooper is a fantastic choice as a young Howard Stark, Tucci is funny and touching, Lee Jones is gruff and comical, Atwell is professional and sexy. In fact, this may be one of the best played casts in years. Captain America wouldn't work without its heart being in the right place. We care for Rogers, and see how pure he is, but that doesn't mean he wont blow the bad guys away. The action scenes are brilliant, and throwing a shield has never looked so attractive.

","The movie introduces us to Steve Rogers, a character with a below average physical strength but an above average wish to protect others, defend his country. We are shown how Steve can't stand doing less than others for his country, how he can't just stay comfortably at his home while there are people dying to protect others, this determination is one of the best aspects this movie has.
From the other side, the movie isn't able to completely convince me how worthy Steve is, which is the main point of this movie, showing us why Steve Rogers is worthy of acquiring this power, while others are not. It was already decided from the first time the doctor saw Steve he would be the one to get the Super Soldier serum, but the movie could have shown us more of why he is truly worthy. He is never really put in real danger, a situation in which he takes a risk to save others (there is the scene with a fake bomb, just imagine it taken even forward, Steve attempting to save someone even though his strength isn't enough, using his intelligence and even almost dying for it, then I would be completely convince he is more worthy than anyone else, but I wasn't).
The side characters are pretty average, serving the regular rolls: the love interest, the best friend and some extras to keep the plot running. I don't think they are really memorable and the relationship with Peggy Carter came out of nowhere just because it was supposed to happen.
The villain isn't that memorable either, he never attempts to do something that directly harms Captain America, he is just somewhere trying to do something else for some reason. He is supposedly related to the Captain because he also used the serum, but it had other effects on him because it was not ready, and that's all, they don't even have a fight you will remember when you finish the movie.
In conclusion, this is a very simple story that could have been done in less time, or, if they really had to do 2 hours, it could have been better executed.

","For the recent rash of Marvel Comics oriented films from the last few years, I found this one to be the most enjoyable for me. Why? I am sure it has to do with the primary setting of the film as war-torn America in the 1940s, Nazis(they ALWAYS make the best villains), a story with loads of heart, not too over-done special effects, and how about Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter(va-voom!) Anyway, this film starts off with a wonderful patriotic tune with some montages of the 2nd world war done credibly and with inspiration. The settings, the mood, the atmospheres mirror much of what we think of during that time - and yes, it is bent toward patriotism. Hey, the guy is called Captain America! I enjoyed the unfolding of the story. Director Joe Johnston, while not a premier director by any means, does what I think might be his best film. This was a popcorn roller-coaster ride, a Saturday morning serial, just good-old-fashioned movie entertainment - the stuff that good comics are made of. The CGI effects are done well for the most part, the set pieces are very credible for their time period, and the acting is pretty good. Chris Evans makes a very affable hero. Tommy Lee Jones is perfect as a craggy, no-nonsense army general, Hugo weaving is a good Red Skull slash Nazi pain-in-the-ass. Hayley Arwell is an adequate actress and breathtaking to behold. A buffet for the eyes to be sure. Two character actors stand out for me though: Toby Jones as Dr. Arnim Zola(he looks like the perfect Nazi scientist) and, most especially, Stanley Tucci as Dr. Abraham Erskine. His portrayal gives the jump-start for this film in terms of how it evolves. he does a very good job with a fairly small role.

Maybe I just love people beating the crap out of Nazi's? Also, I really liked the characters, especially Steve Rogers. He seems kind of like me. Unlike Thor and Tony Stark, this guy isn't a douchbag half the time. He's very likable and you really root for him. And his love interest is good as well, she's a tough female lead in a the time of World War II. But my favorite was Phillips, he was just so stereotypical war colonel that it was funny. And the film has a very good sense of humor without going over the top with it. The villain was cool, and Hugo Weaving was perfect.

But once in a while, someone a director or and actor or a writer comes a long, to reinstate at least some hope back in all that bland unoriginal theme, and in the right way.

That's the word - originality and ingenuity, - you don't get that often in Hollywood now- a-days, and this really slapped it on like well ridden material. A true homage, and even though my ""fellow"" viewers found it a bit ""unrealistic"" and the humor ""obvious/offbeat comic-relief"" they don't know what the movie competitors are, to truly know how much other movies now a days are off beat in humor and ""weird"", my fellow viewers are insane, and don't know what they're talking about. There were no boring bits, and it was funny and quirky all the way. And most of all it was GENUINE, - weirdness and offbeat humor are made splendid when like in the movie where the main character learns from the scientist that value of strength is what's important, - this movie shows how the value of the genuine is important, and that can triumph over occasional unrealistic marvel aspects and offbeat humour (if any) any time of any day in this current movie industry.",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

","From director Joe Johnston (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, Jumanji, Jurassic Park III), with Superman, Wonder Woman and Spider-Man the superhero of this Marvel comics based film has a very iconic costume, and I was keen to see what it would be like. Basically, set in 1942, World War II has begun, and Steve Rogers (Fantastic Four's Chris Evans) from New York City is keen to join the fight, but he has been rejected a few times because of his health and physical problems. It is only after overhearing a conversation that Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) helps him enlist in the army, the scientist has recruited him for a new ""super soldier"" experiment, with Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) and British agent Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) also keeping an eye on him. Phillips is for a while unconvinced, but Steve's conviction and self sacrifice change his mind, and before the real experiment treatment goes ahead Steve is warned of what happened to Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) who suffered bad effects after an imperfect version. While Schmidt and his sidekick Dr. Arnim Zola (Toby Jones) are harnessing the energies of the powerful tesseract cube, Steve goes through the super soldier treatment, with special serum injected into his body with doses of ""vita-rays"", and he emerges from the chamber bigger and muscular than before. The success of the experiment is short lived though when Schmidt's assassin Heinz Kruger (Richard Armitage) kills Dr. Erskine, and destroys the formula tubes, and Steve goes after him in a big chase, but the assassin kills himself with a cyanide capsule before he can be questioned. With the experiment lost Steve is given a position so scientists cannot study him and rediscover the formula, he is given a colourful stars and stripes costume to become ""Captain America"" and promote war bonds, before hearing his friend James Buchanan 'Bucky' Barnes (Sebastian Stan) may be in trouble. Steve has Peggy and Howard Stark, Tony's father (Dominic Cooper) take him behind enemy lines to rescue Barnes and other captured soldier, also meeting Schmidt who reveals his true face under his skin mask, a skull-like red face, hence his other name ""the Red Skull"", and they all return to base. Next Steve, Timothy 'Dumb Dumb' Dugan (Band of Brothers' Neal McDonough), Gabe Jones (Derek Luke), Jim Morita (Kenneth Choi), James Montgomery Falsworth (J. J. Feild), and Jacques Dernier (Bruno Ricci) attacking other bases run by the evil organisation HYDRA, and Stark gives Steve an experimental circular shield made of rare vibranium, an indestructible metal. A mission on a train sees Barnes fall to his death, and they capture Zola, and he gives them information that leads them onto a mission to stop Schmidt using weapons of mass destruction on American cities, and in the process of the fight the tesseract is damaged. Schmidt handles the powerful cube, and dissolves into bright light, while the cube melts the floor and falls to Earth, and Steve is still in the plane, and with no way to land it safely with the weapons on board he starts it heading to the ground in the Arctic. Stark is seen finding the tesseract in the ocean, while Steve awakes in a 1940s style hospital room, but he recognises a radio broadcast he already heard, and he breaks out of the fake scenario to find himself in present day New York, Times Square, and meeting S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) who reveals he has been asleep for 70 years. Also starring Harry Potter's David Bradley as Tower Keeper and Stan Lee as General. I thought it was odd that Evans was cast as another Marvel comics hero, having already been The Human Torch, but it is actually a really good choice as he is straightforward and determined, Weaving is a good power crazed villain, and Jones gets some good moments as the concerned Colonel. The story obviously sets up that he is the first Marvel hero in history, and will lead onto Avengers Assemble, the story is pretty easy to understand with the world destruction trying to be stopped concept, less so with the political war stuff, and the special effects accompanied with good fights definitely keep you engaged, an entertaining wartime action adventure.

","¨General Patton has said that wars are fought with weapons but are won by men. Our goal is to create the greatest army in history, but every army begins with one man. He will be the first in a new breed of super-soldier.¨ Summer is synonym of superhero action movies. It seems as if every week we get bombarded with new superhero films, whether it be from the Marvel universe or the DC comics (I know, I've said this before). This summer started off with Thor, then it followed with the X-Men Origins franchise, next came The Green Lantern, and now finally we approach the end of the season with Captain America. I don't have a problem with this at all since they usually end up being pretty good and some of my most anticipated movies for 2012 are actually superhero films (The Avengers and The Dark Knight Rises). The question is how long can the producers keep on making these films entertaining and fresh for audiences. Captain America seemed to suffer from some of this overexposure these comic heroes have been having on the big screen. It's still a good movie, but it didn't feel all that fresh and we've grown used to seeing these heroes do great stuff and fight some terrible villains. The visuals are great as usual, the characters are interesting (comic book characters usually are very well developed since they've been in circulation for years), the stories are well developed, and the performances are great (especially from the supporting cast). So the question still remains: why wasn't I that excited about Captain America? I found it an average and forgettable film despite all these great factors contributing to the movie. I guess I've already answered this: it just didn't feel fresh enough, and it didn't bring anything new to the genre.

","Captain America: The First Avenger (2011): Dir: Joe Johnston / Cast: Chris Evans, Tommy Lee Jones, Hugo Weaving, Hayley Atwell, Sebastian Stan: Here is a superhero who is all about the home front and protecting America. Chris Evans isn't new to the superhero roles and here he is in his element playing a young adult who desires to defend his country in the heat of the second World War but because of his small size he is rejected. Finally a scientist takes interest and has him go through an experiment that broadens his muscle tones. Now he can assist in the fight against the war but instead, he is placed in a ridiculous costume and doing commercials. He will eventually take charge and go after the leader of the Hydra cult whom he will do battle against with his trusted shield. How this concludes is somewhat depressing in its venture into an Avengers film. Where the film goes wrong is in its formula placement of supporting roles. Hugo Weaving does well as the Hydra leader who turns out to be some sort of mutant. Tommy Lee Jones has the standard role of military leader who down plays Evans and discourages him until Captain America proves his skill. The worst element is Hayley Atwell as the female Lieutenant whose role consists of looking tough and being Captain America's potential bed buddy. Sebastian Stan plays Captain's best pal who ends up the victim of a nasty accident. Director Joe Johnston previously made Jumanji and The Wolfman. Here he presents tremendous shield swinging action that represents the comic book despite obvious corny patriot elements.

Chris Evans is good (though I do miss the cleverness he exhibited in Fantastic Four, in which he was about the only good thing) as Steve Rogers, a 90lb weakling (created through some good CGI effects) who undergoes an experiment to make him a superman. Although he immediately exhibits heroics, no one knows what to do with him, so they just use him as a war bond salesman. He feels kind of worthless about it, especially at USO shows where he just ends up as the butt of jokes by weary servicemen who would rather just see the dancers come back on stage. Soon enough, he gets another opportunity to be a hero, and, after that, he becomes a full-fledged soldier with an elite team to fight Hydra, a secret Nazi scientific organization working on super-powered weaponry (Hugo Weaving and Toby Jones are great as the villain Red Skull and his lead scientific mind). The film is quite respectful to the era and WWII (it easily could have come off as insulting), while still being an exciting and fun modern action flick.

","Steve Rogers was a bit cliché, but then the movie was about the 1940s, so clichés were common. There's really no way to spoil this movie, if you know anything about Captain America. Also the movie is mostly gun fights and explosions, just like a Michael Bay movie! The premise is an American made Superman through science. A lot of experiments when on during the 1940s, we invented the atom bomb, etc. So a scientist making a super soldier would have been on their ""To Do"" list, if it were an option. As for characters, Steve Rogers wasn't that cliché, or at least, I didn't think so. He didn't have too many emotions though. He's not witty or charming. He's just your standard save-the-day super hero.I did enjoin the scenes where he used his brain instead of brawn, but those scenes are scarce indeed. The other characters were so bland, I can't even remember their names. There was ""Uncle Ben"" as the scientist. ""Lois Lane"" as the only female main character. Tommy Lee Jones as a stereotypical colonel( it was his dialogue, not his fault!), and there was the best friend. Not a whole lot of character development. Actually, now that I think about it, there wasn't any...Steve Rogers stays exactly the same through out the movie. He doesn't reach some profound understanding of anything. He just fights a lot and blows things up. I'm not joking, the movie is 70-80% explosions and gun fights. The whole movie is just to set up the back story for that Avengers movie, just like Thor!

In my opinion Stanley Tucci steals the show in his early appearances as the gentle scientist who prefers the spunky but skinny Rogers for his project. And the CG action scenes which crop up during the movie are a little more realistic than the cut-action/rock video Michael Bay style, where you can't even tell what's going on most of the time. It also does well in projecting the WWII atmosphere. That being said, this movie suffers from two major flaws shared with other Marvel entries - it's TOO DAMN LONG and it is too derivative in its story line. These movies really don't work at over 1:30, it often seems like there's filler thrown in to stretch the time for network resale (or whatever the reason is). There's very little flow from one scene to another. The plot turns are almost formula, this one has elements of Spiderman I & III along with some Star Wars and Lord of the Rings thrown in.

That period happens to be the WWII Era in the United States. This is a period of time when Americans probably felt the most patriotic. We were sending our young men into war to save the world. Men signed up willingly and those who couldn't fight, found ways to contribute. I think that if any of us suddenly woke up in 1940s America, we'd find it a very different world.",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

","I just finished watching this and I absolutely love it!
Steve Rogers is a short, skinny guy with several health issues - but he is desperate to get into the army and fight in World War 2. He tries several times, but is rejected due to his health issues and his shortness. Then, he is approached by Dr. Abraham Erskine, who works in the military, and is drafted. While he is nowhere near as fit as all the other soldiers, he turns out to be smarter and a bigger heart than all the rest. He is chosen to be the guinea pig, so to speak, of a serum that Erskine and Howard Stark created, that will make him bigger, more muscular, stronger, and his senses, bodily activities and abilities are at least 4 times more enhanced than a normal human. It is successful, and he becomes Captain America.
Instead of going on to fight in the war, he is simply used on TV to try and inspire Americans to fight against the Nazis - which isn't as successful as they would like. After the 107th is attacked by Germans, and most killed or captured, Rogers goes alone to one of the Hydra bases and rescues the survivors, among whom was his best friend Bucky Barnes.
Meanwhile, the movies villain, Schimdt (I think I'm spelling that correctly) or Red Skull, harnesses the Tessaract's power to power his weapons to take over the world. Catching wind of his plans, Captain America must try and stop him.
(Sorry for the soppy plot description).
This film is set in the 1940s, and I found it rather refreshing. It seems to be accurate with it's historical setting - the costumes, the vehicles, etc., etc. I like how the lighting effects reflects it's time setting. Chris Evans, Sebastian Stan, and the woman who plays Peggy all do an awesome job in their roles as Cap, Bucky, and Peggy - well, everyone does, but they are the most notable, alongside Dominic something or other who plays Howard Stark, Tony's father. The saying like father, like son strongly applies with Howard and Tony, if you get my drift.
The action scenes are awesome and one-hundred-percent preposterous - but you'll still love it. You just have to laugh, though, at its unrealism and cheesiness.
Hugo Weaving does a stellar job as Red Skull, the villain. I like the Garden of Eden references and the Raiders of the Lost Ark parallels - particularly something in the climax, which I will not spoil. The mystical themes were quite an interesting addition, as well.
I totally enjoyed this vintage movie and am looking forward to watching the next film!",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

","Captain America is my much younger brother. He is small for his age and has challenges (of course, we all do). This wasn't a typical Superhero transfered to the big screen. Nor is it one of those underdog stories like The NeverEnding Story, where a boy faces the obstacles of his size to become a hero, unlike almost any other. Instead this time it was almost a tear-jerker to a guy who almost never cries, being how good of a heart he had from the beginning and how he was so humble and gentle and didn't like bullys and wanted to join the Army because of all the men risking laying their lives and how he felt he shouldn't be doing any less. But here Seeing very, very skinny and short Steve Rogers being transformed into a perfect body, over 6 feet tall and muscular; perfect for patriotic combat and doing among many, other stunts, jumping from Army planes to break in and rescue captured soldiers from Red Skull and his men was so cool. He has the most ideal physique, not huge, but fairly large and pumped up, but the same heart and humility as the very, very little and Frail Steve Rogers. The supervillans are in line with Adolf Hitler, as you all know. Tommy Lee Jones made the movie a winner itself. It was a little disappointing seeing Stanly Tucci's character, Steve's good, kindly friend who saw him as war material from the beginning dies right after Steve Transforms into Chris Evans in his real physique after a man in league with Hydra blew his cover by terrorizing the lab. Red Skull could've done fine just as Hugo Weaving without the ugly mask, but it made him more scary as he is first seen when a building is burning and he jumps from great heights saving his best friend who was his bodyguard before he became the poignant physically strong and agile superhero.

He defines courage and commitment; quite literally he has inspired thousands of people, men and women, to don their nation's uniform as soldiers – and Chris Evans doesn't hump the bunk. He was Human Torch in Fantastic Four as well, and that character was a real punk. With Steve Rogers, though, Evans brings a more serious presence to the classic shield-wielding super soldier. As his creator reminds him, a strong man loses respect for strength and power, but a weak man will never take it for granted. Still, none of that matters a hill of beans, because Tommy Lee Jones as the ever charming, Colonel Phillips, steals the whole film!

Knowing all of this I still enjoyed the movie. Though I will mention my two friends that went with me and knew very little about CA enjoyed it a little bit more because there were a few more surprises for them. Of course this is no Dark Knight, very few if any superhero movies are but I can tell you that this to me was better than the recent X-men first class, which I also enjoyed. This was also better than the two Iron man movies because the character is more relate-able in contrast to Iron man's rich playboy with everything becomes a superhero.Chris Evans fits in perfectly as CA and as one other reviewer also mentioned, He is a much better CA than he was as the Human torch. You take to heart the evolution of his character from a scrawny kid from Brooklyn to one of America's greatest heroes. The supporting cast is also an awesome supplement, especially Tommy lee Jones' and Stanley Tucci characters. The movie takes liberties with the history of WWII, but just pretend this is taking place in an alternative universe (which most of these movies are anyway) and you will be fine. Overall this a good movie to go to if your are into superhero movies with a lot of action, which with respect to few CGI, seem realistic(in terms of movie action).I watched it in 2D because let's be realistic, the only movies I would like to see in 3D is Avatar because it was hyped as an awesome 3D movie.

Cap's is a story that's terribly tricky to translate from the printed page without slipping into an ocean of cheese somewhere along the way, and though this latest attempt does lose its footing from time to time, it always seems to recover with grace and dignity. It's more a living, breathing comic book than any of Marvel's big screen properties to make the leap thus far, with motorcycle chases, laser beams, crisply uniformed enemy forces and pseudo-iconic freeze frames around every corner. Chris Evans lives his role as the star-spangled Avenger, the white bread everyman with an unnervingly positive disposition, Hugo Weaving clearly relishes his chance to play the thoroughly evil, black leather-clad Red Skull and Tommy Lee Jones enjoys more than just a cameo as the brilliantly-cast drill sergeant in charge of the whole operation. Though I had hoped for a more honest depiction of the period, as I think a genuine WW2 setting is when the Captain is truly in his element, it's tough to maintain that perspective when bright blue lasers are firing from the enemy's hands throughout the picture.

The main reason I considered watching this new version of the ""Marvel Comic"" superhero Captain America,"" is because it is an adaptation of one of the most popular characters in comic book history. In addition, that diverse character actor Tommy Lee Jones is in this film. I was slightly surprised to discover that this ""Captain America"" film was put together with some glimmer of professionalism and imagination. The leading man isn't required to do much except look tough and handsome (not much else comes to mind). I quite like the 1940s look. That was a smart move by the writers because Captain America was created when the United States entered the Second World War, so this film is fairly faithful to the source material.

Therefore to watch this movie has brought old memories to me though this version is quite different from the old ones. But sticking to the movie, this is an action movie that adds something more to the story than average action movies usually do: it has an ideology and a healthy one: antinazism. Notwithstanding that the villain here (Johann Schmidt / Red Skull) is some kind of a Nazi dissident who wants to exploit his superpowers to his own profit. The rest is the usual amount of classic brilliant computer made special visual effects, the thrilling action and the no less usual suspense clichés.

Some sixty or seventy odd years on however, and the political landscape, and the landscape of entertainment itself, has shifted dramatically. So much so that even Batman—the same guy that starred in that super goofy TV series back in the day—has adapted himself into something of a cultural phenomenon, making himself matter once again by switching gears and adapting to that change in the way society views a hero, and in turn, what that means.

I wanted to see that for so long, and still haven't mind you, but as soon as I saw the trailer for Captain America I knew I wanted to see it more. I just thought it looked cooler, seeings as I hardly ever watch Sci-Fi's anyway. The best character was Howard Stark, yes he was in it. Something so cool, you would never have seen that in Green Lantern. Sorry I was just excited because Iron Man is like my favorite superhero.

","Captain america the first avenger stars chris evans as steve rogers in his third superhero outing after fantastic four and push.
Set in 1940s, it narrates the story of steve rogers who is trying passionately to join the US army but is constantly rejected due to his poor physical condition. At this time, he's spotted by Dr. Erksine who at that time is working on a super soldier experimentation program and chooses steve for his experiment because of the latter's pure heart. Steve joins the army and falls in love with agent peggy carter. Steve is sent for the experiment and turns successful giving him super physical strength. But few minutes after the experiment erksine is shot by a hydra agent leading shield in dilemma because without erksine one cant successfully experiment with other soldiers. Hence, steve is reduced as a character actor for army plays. But steve proves his worth by saving american soldiers from hydra camp thus becoming captain america. He fights many wars along with his best friend bucky and lock horns with hydra leader red skull.
What I loved in the film is the character of steve rogers. Such an honest and sincere persons are rare to find. One could understanding his qualities in that fake grenade scene. The transformation of the short and skinny steve rogers to tall and muscular captain america was great. Hugo weaving played red skull very well. Though I didn't find the love track of peggy and steve intriguing but it managed to play an important part in future films of steve. Also his friendship with bucky. In civil war, steve didn't support bucky just because he was his friend but because he was always the one who gave him moral support in his bad times. That's what in one scene bucky says that I am not following captain america but that skinny guy who is so idiot enough to get beaten up. If you have seen chris evans off screen then you will be shocked to see how such a cool and fun loving guy can play a no-nonsense steve rogers.
But the film has some drawbacks too. First is the film's narration is slow which is not good for a superhero film. Second is film lacks humour because of which it becomes the least favorite mcu film. And the action scenes are not upto the mark.
Overall, captain america the first avenger lacks the popcorn entertainment of a regular mcu film but is watchable because of chris evans performance and good presentation of 1940s.",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

","It's garbage. I had a feeling about it being awful when i saw the trailer and cast. Nonetheless, I wanted to see it because I WAS planning on watching ""The Avengers"" and wanted to know all the background stories. So, where to start (being that the entire movie was a piece of shi.t)... The love story: The chick didn't even care about him before he got buffed and emerged from that stupid contraption without his shirt. OK, after his out she keeps checking him out, hardly restraining not to touch him, after witch, in the rest of the movie, she keeps on meeting with him for no apparent reason and at some point they actually kiss. Why did she like him ??? Just because he pumped himself full of steroids ? I can't recall any other reason... And, what was her role in the movie ? I can only guess that she was the army slut, having no other particular use for anyone actually. Always dressed up and wearing makeup regardless the scene, not doing anything at any point... I don't know, i just couldn't stand her. Next: That stupid Captain America. Only the name gets on my nerves. WHY WAS HE A CAPTAIN and everyone in the movie started calling him that way ? HE WAS NOT A CAPTAIN. Disregarding this, i hate seeing metr0sexuals portrayed as an icon and the absolute good guy that everyone should look up to. that's not making a film for intelligent people. it's for idiots who don't know any better.

The last thing i want to mention... what year was the movie in ? i mean... they had absolutely everything they wanted. laser guns, super planes, super cars, what happened to evolution since then ? anyways, dumb movie for dumb people and a waste of time for me. it got a 7 average rating so maybe it was aimed at the right audience (if you know what i mean)",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

","Thawed-out war hero Steve Rogers (Evans) is ever more uneasy about his affiliation with deep-spy network S.H.I.E.L.D.. And when the organisation turns on him, he uncovers a horrifying conspiracy.
There is something pleasingly, and no doubt deliberately, ironic in Marvel Studios' flag-wearing hero fronting its most subversive movie yet. Not that writers Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus are being subtle about it. ""You're holding a gun to everyone on Earth and calling it protection,"" Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) tells Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) early on. During the very same dialogue he says, ""I thought the punishment usually came after the crime,"" and - just in case we hadn't got the point - ""This isn't freedom, this is fear."" Even so, what we have here is the key to Captain America's real appeal, the answer to any criticism that he's just a stiff-necked, steroidal boy scout. As a 95 year-old thirtysomething with an early-'40s value set in War-On-Terror America, he is less the USA's poster boy than its most steadfast foil. Something co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo (Welcome To Collinwood) clearly relish getting their indie-cred teeth into on a blockbuster scale.
Post-Chitauri invasion, Rogers is a useful asset for shady superspy network S.H.I.E.L.D., but also a pain in the ass. During a great opening set-piece in which Rogers, Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and a squad of S.H.I.E.L.D. goons take out a crew of French/Algerian pirates, our blond hero complains of being forced to play ""Fury's caretaker"". This is not what he signed up for. This is not what America should be doing. History has seen the nation gradually diminished from world's saviour, to world's policeman, to a ""caretaker"" over the course of decades. For Rogers the moral decline appears instantaneous, and it rankles intensely. There are then indirect tributes to Edward Snowden's whistleblowing and shades of the NSA privacy-invasion scandal. Pretty bold stuff to be sneaking under the canvas of this primary-coloured marquee.
It's uncertain how much any of it will land with the film's young, core audience, although this does feel like Marvel's most 'mature' picture yet, an admirable risk to take. It is certainly the studio's most talky and plotty, and the big wink that is the casting of Robert Redford (who, by the way, would have been ideal Cap casting in the '70s) as S.H.I.E.L.D. suit Alexander Pierce suggests 1975's Three Days Of The Condor as its most obvious inspiration. The Manchurian Candidate (1962) is in there too, for sure. But, as Rogers' journey manhandles him out into the cold and makes him a hoodie-wearing renegade advised to ""trust nobody"" and targeted by a similarly empowered super-agent (the titular Winter Soldier), the influence of the Bourne trilogy weighs down, too - the Russos even going so far as to steal a famous Bourne shot directly towards the film's end.
The action and violence are the most grounded we've seen in a Marvel film. The First Avenger, with its steampunk-laser weirdness and numbing, never-ending montages, felt dull and insulated. Iron Man, Thor and Hulk all dodge (or brush off) bullets via their self-evident fantastical/sci-fi trimmings. But, apart from the fact that he lobs a big metal Frisbee around and has been artificially pumped to the very peak of attainable physical fitness, the Captain is operating on the same plane as Jason Bourne, Jack Ryan and James Bond. He even throws a knife at someone.
Evans has settled comfortably into the title role, and bolsters its appeal with a precise charm, never letting you forget that the heart of a regular and sincere wimp beats beneath that rock-sculpted chest. He spends much of the film working up a will-they-could-they? partnership with Johansson's still-sparky Black Widow, who enjoys her greatest chunk of Marvel screen time yet. It's an engaging double act. And when he isn't ticking off Fury, running righteous rings around the cycloptic boss' persistent, end-justifies-means ambivalence, he's fostering a whole new buddyship with Anthony Mackie's likable veteran support-group organiser Sam Wilson.
And then the wings pop out. Wilson, after all, is also The Falcon. Not just any ex-forces guy, but someone with secret impossi-tech that enables him to flap about like a supersonic swift. To chide this development as silly in a comic-book movie may be like spitting out a jellybean for tasting of chemicals, but even so, after the Russos' first-rate work setting up a smart, Washington, D.C.-based conspiracy thriller, it feels like a backstep into formula. And The Falcon does look naff: Three Days Of The Condor giving way to Condorman.
Inexorably, the whole enterprise drifts into business as usual. The more the story refers back to the first Captain America film, the less interesting it becomes - its subversiveness becomes subverted. The twists are easy to figure, and certain reveals are just stamp-your-foot hoary. Plus, given the constant reminders that this is just one adventure within the greater Marvelverse, you can't help but be distracted by one, nagging question: wouldn't Tony Stark have something to say about all this? Especially when those huge, deadly S.H.I.E.L.D. machines - now propelled by his technology - launch into the sky.
Speaking of which, The Winter Soldier is the third of the last four Marvel movies to take its final-act set-piece into American airspace and feature a lot of shiny CG things whizzing around amid orange-blossom detonations. In Avengers Assemble it was exhilarating. In Iron Man 3 it was acceptable. Now it's a case of, ""This again? Really guys?"" There's also an earlier action gag, in which the Captain single-handedly takes down an aircraft on a bridge, that is almost a beat-for-beat repeat of Heimdall's dark-elf ship takedown on the Bifrost in Thor: The Dark World - and it, too, feels like a last-minute, studio-led insertion.
None of this is ruinous, though. The Winter Soldier does go out on an intriguing note, which should have big repercussions on future Earthbound Marvel stories. Captain America is an interesting character, arguably the most interesting of the Avengers, the one with the greatest thematic scope. And that can only bode well for his next solo, hopefully Helicarrier-free, outing.
It may climax with an overly formulaic splurge, but The Winter Soldier benefits from an old-school-thriller tone that, for its first half at least, distinguishes it from its more obviously superheroic Marvel cousins.",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

But he's just as strong as a strong man, and yet he has this confidence. And that's what made him special for me. I had literally no idea what I was going to expect in this movie. I watched it with a complete blank slate. I didn't even know Captain America's real name is Steven Rogers. That's how less I knew of him. I just admired him because, well, I've already said it.",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

","CAPTAIN America. is that rare film that makes you feel good. the story follows the comic book. The Story is this. 1943 America is at war and the United States government is banking every thing on the Super Soldier formula. Steve Rogers is the test subject who was selected out of a small group of men to test the formula. The Serum works and Rogers becomes the world's first American Super soldier. Then a German spy kills the inventor of the serum and Rogers goes after the killer when he does so in public and pictures are taken of him the Government decides he would be more useful selling War Bonds on a USO tour. Rogers is angry because this is not what he believes he was given the super soldier serum for. Then he finds out a friend of his Bucky Barnes is trapped behind enemy lines along with most of his unit. Steve Rogers now code named Captain America disobeys orders and rescues Bucky and the Howling commandos. once he does this the government sees the worth in him fighting the battles that need to be fought. His greatest challenge is the evil mad Red Skull who was given a earlier version of the serum which disfigured him and gave him immense power. The rest of the film is the conflict between the Red Skull and Captain America and how Cap is trying to stop the Skull's ultimate plan to destroy the allied forces. It Ends up with Captain America defeating the Red Skull only to be thrust into suspended animation for over 75 years and when he awakes it's to a strange new world. Not a bad movie I enjoyed it greatly,Chris Evans proved to me he can carry Captain America's Shield and Hugo Weaving oozes evil as the Red Skull. Tommy Lee Jones gives a strong performance as General Chester Phillips. The movie's biggest strength is the fact that it adheres to old style film making values it felt like watching a old style action film from when they really did know how to make films. Joe Johnston is a old style film maker right up there with John Ford and Howard Hawks and he never seems to get the credit he deserves. With Captain America he makes his best picture yet.

He even goes on the road, also starring in some films before he is taking serious when his comrades in war need him. It is the adventure of a lifetime for Rogers, who will become Captain America, then the films falls apart. It becomes a little boring and predictable. The fault is not the cast, especially Chris Evans, who shines in this role as an all American hero. He is perfect for the role. The fault does lie in the writers and directors hands.

The story isnt boring at all, it is in fact the start of a much later storyline about super soldiers and the danger they can represent. And it culminate comics with real life; Steve Rodgers, aka Cap, thinks the infusion to make him a super soldier is made to send him out to make spaghetti of Hitler. While reality is that the US government wants to use him to sell war bonds and give the population bread and circus in trying times. Off course, what happens, Mr. Rodgers turns rogue and goes after the villain, Red Skull (a poorly underused Hugo Weaving), who possesses something that will be very important in many MCU movies in the future. In the end, a point weaker than the great start with Iron Man. But it's again WERY different then the rest of the movies. It even gave Cap's love interest, Peggy Carter, an own, shortlived tv show.

","Have you ever dreamt of being an American hero? Steve Rodgers certainly has but he hasn't yet found much success in making his fantasy become a reality. Steve is small, weak, and awkward. He has tried to enlist in Army but has been refused. After meeting a friendly doctor who decides to give him a try, he joins the Army and soon after becomes part of an experiment to test drugs that will strengthen him and give him a better chance to be successful. While all this is going on, a madman named Schmidt is attempting to take over the world. This film, set in the 1940s, feels more like a war movie than a superhero movie. Either way however, director Joe Johnston pulls it off and does it very well. It is highly entertaining, with perfect acting, grand sets, and a first-class story. I especially liked Tommy Lee Jones' performance as the rough colonel. As it began, I was comparing the characters of Steve Rodgers and Peter Parker, from Spider-Man, who both are week and not at all hero-like but become powerful as the stories go on. However, there couldn't be a bigger difference between the two because Steve Rodgers is so much more of a stronger and likable character altogether.

","I thought this movie was really good but it definitely wasn't the ""best superhero movie ever"" like so many people have proclaimed.

The ending could've been a lot more emotional as well. I'm not asking for sobbing and ridiculous crying but if you actually think about what was happening, having some more emotion would've made it feel more genuine and authentic. Chris Evans is great as Captain America though. His role doesn't call for the darkness of Bruce Wayne or the charisma of Tony Stark but it does call for a certain level of confidence and straightforwardness and arrogance. Chris Evans hits all of those well. One of the few other weak parts was the villain. The Red Skull just wasn't all that terrifying or intimidating.

","As I see, people like Joe Johnston, believe in him, it seems that Marvel and the producers believed in him too, but why they didn't choose a more successful or a master director for the project? And another question, why they didn't think much about the actor who would play Captain America? I am not sure about the director, but I have had a name in my mind from the beginning and he is Chris Pine! What a coincidence that both of the actors' name is Chris. At this point, I have to say that I like Chris Evans and hearing some news about his reactions towards the negative criticisms saddened me and I know that we, you, whatever, like him too. And I have to say another thing, as you know, Chris Evans played another super hero before in Fantastic Four, Johnny Storm which creates another problem itself, because simply it is a bad idea, but what I am going to say at this point is that he was great as Johnny Storm, the chemistry between Evans and his character was flawless. In Captain America, I couldn't buy him as Captain America and believe me it was a really bad thing! As for direction, the production quality, technical quality, art direction etc. are outstanding and if you say if an entertainment movie is really entertaining, that's enough, that's OK, but don't expect a Byran Singer, Tim Burton or Ang Lee. And the negative hype about the action is partly true. I couldn't see any great action scene here. The action is satisfying, yet standard. It doesn't leave an impression on you. As for the problem with the script, this is may be the biggest problem of the movie, the movie has a very long introduction which is good, but a short and fast development and conclusion. This has a negative effect on action either unfortunately, because you know, if you focus on the origin story too much, then you can't find a lot of time for action and adventure or Captain's powers. Tommy Lee Jones just shines in the movie and with cliché terms, he steals the show in the scenes he appears. There is not any problem with Hugo Weaving and his villain too. May be the only problem is that we can't learn much information about his background story, but it is fine. One of the good sides of the movie, at least for me is that the movie is not a propaganda movie (there is a big difference between heroism/patriotism and propaganda) or it does not try to give the audience some political messages and it is not a populist movie like ""Battle Los Angeles"" for example, I loved this, I appreciated (I don't know is it important for anybody but) As for some details, I know, they had tried to make the costume realistic and they did, which is not a bad thing, but as a person who seriously gives importance to costumes and appearances, I didn't like Captain America's costume very much. Yes, I don't hate campy or kitsch super hero costumes.

Not sure if I ever gonna finish it, anyway, let's start!
I liked this movie a lot, was a kind of emotional, action-filled journey through Steve Rogers' origin story. Emotions weren't missing, that grenade catching scene proved me that Steve was the perfect choice for Captain America's role. Even though the movie's main concept seemed sort of banal (felt that Wolfenstein vibe :D) but thankfully a twist was given to it. The ending felt reallly fast-paced for me, at least it became understandable at the very end.
I'd give a light 8 as a start.

","Captain America: The First Avenger is an action-packed look at what can happen when you mix old fashioned soldiering with then modern-day science. Take for instance Steve Rogers, played wonderfully in this movie by Chris Evans (Fantastic Four) who is clearly undersized and asthmatic in the movie via special effects, in a film taking place during the World War II era. Bring in one Dr. Abraham Erskine (Staley Tucci) who meets Rogers one night at a a fair who gives him a legitimate shot at US Army boot camp & Rogers proves the good Dr right through his bravery. That was not all Erskine had in mind for the badly undersized Rogers though, they wanted to make this private a super soldier, in fact they wanted to make a whole line of super soldiers to go over and fight Hitler and his men. Rogers would be just the first. So after showing all of his military superiors his great qualities, Rogers was chosen to be the first super soldier and was a set up for the experimental transformation. With great courage the transformation occurred, but there was a HYDRA agent on site, an agent working alongside the Nazis that assassinated the good Dr Erskine ending the program then & there but Rogers, now a super soldier, was able to RUN the assassin down through the streets of New York and kill him. Because of his heroics Rogers earned the nickname Captain America and a new phase of the movie began. It was not a bed of roses of Captain America right away though. His military higher ups did grant him the rank of Captain because of his heroics on the streets of New York but instead of serving over in Europe they though it best he raise bonds for the war by entertaining crowds at home and abroad because he was such a unique specimen. When one of these performances went bad in front of a crowd of tired soldiers abroad, Captain America had had enough and devised a plan on his own to help save some troops behind enemy lines. Captain America, as I will call the movie for the remainder of this review, is simply a good movie done well. Clearly they call it the First Avenger because it sets up the Avengers movies that came later that featured Marvel superheroes Thor, Black Widow, the Hulk and so fourth and saw Captain America as the historical starting point. The action in the film is very good, as are the special effects. The writing is good. The soundtrack in the film is good as well as is the period costuming both in the mid 1940's and late in the movie in the early 2010's. Captain America, the movie once again, simply is a fun movie to watch with family, friends or by yourself!! 6 out of 10 stars!!",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

","The story of Steve Roger is unprecedented in cinema until now. Unlike most comic book movies this film is set in the 1940s. Rogers is your everyday nice but skinny weak looking guy who cares about others. A man who would be seen as the last you'd send into battle, but maybe...just maybe, the man with the biggest heard. Chris Evans is a splendid choice as our protagonist Captain America, and the scene where he dives over the grenade makes you feel another level of emotion. Picked to become a super soldier for his uniqueness, intellect and heart, Steve Rogers must lead soldiers into war to stop his ultimate nemesis Schmidt aka the red skull. With the side story of Rogers and Agent Carter slowly falling for each other. Both willing to wait for the right partner. Carter and Rogers must first get through a threat maybe even worse than Hitler himself. Hayley Atwell provides a strong independent woman in Carter and has depths of emotion towards the end. Rogers is rejected from doing his part in the army to begin with for being to small in stature. Tommy Lee Jones character Chester Philips had little faith in Rogers and is mainly standard Tommy Lee probably slightly under used as this character. The red skull is very caricatured and typical of what you expect a comic villain set in World War Two to be. Admittedly Hugo Weaving doesn't really stand out as an amazing charismatic villain or even as of much threat as he could have.

It has remained a typical superhero story on the ground and not quite so super natural.
That's an advantage sometimes a disadvantage the interactions of the people are the best.
There is a place where a child is kidnapped and then it is thrown into a river by evil our hero wants to go after but the boy says ""no, no, I can swim, run after him""
There is a very dramatic place where the hero and his dear interest have to say goodbye, he goes away she kisses him first. He is surprised and Tommy Lee Jones just looks at him weirdly and says, ""I will not kiss her""

687,23 September 2013,JPfanatic93,8," Great comic book fun!
","The last of the single Avengers films, though ironically the 'Living Legend' is the oldest Marvel comic book character of the bunch. Applying a delicious comic-y retro visual style to the Second World War and the introduction of the super soldier, the adventures of the 'First Avenger' resemble their drawn counterparts the most, making for a very fun action film. Eager to sign up with the armed forces during WW II, brave but physically feeble Steve Rogers (Chris Evans, who previously played another Marvel character, the Human Torch, in Fox's Fantastic Four) continues to be rejected for service. However, his strength of will and general boldness eventually make him a good candidate for a secret super soldier project, which turns him into an almost superhuman character, physical and sensory abilities all functioning at peak efficiency. Dubbed Captain America, Steve is initially used only for propaganda performances, but after pulling off a heroic rescue mission deemed near suicide, allied command realizes he's of most use at the front lines, where he soon gets on the radar of the Red Skull (another great villain on Hugo Weaving's resumé), the leader of a covert Nazi organization called Hydra, which dabbles both in the scientific and the supernatural. Meanwhile, Steve also has a hard time finding time for romance with feisty army dame Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell). If you overlook the blatantly patriotic American overtones and you don't mind the fact Captain America's battles look nothing like the actual WW II due to their use of near steam punk levels of science (partially courtesy of the Thor influence, continuing to successfully set up a larger, shared Marvel cinematic universe) and the presence of the somewhat silly, overly politically correct, ethnically diverse Howling Commandos (Wah-Hooo!), you're in for one awesome roller-coaster of a semi-superhero action flick. Plus impressive visual effects, including making a tall, muscular man look short and skinny (yes, those were actually Chris Evans' real muscles, but he never looked like that wimpy little guy).",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

","Captain America: The First Avenger, directed by Joe Johnston is one of the most mixed films of the MCU.

Even though his story telling skills aren't the sharpest, with a lot of unsolved plots being moved around and botched together; Cap's origin story carried most of the load, with the compliment of some of Johnston's direction and style, to an extent. He used a lot of specific framing techniques, with a few certain sized lense' to really capture that 1940's feel; other than that, Johnston struggled to find a steady tempo, leading the film to be messy, and pretty dry. If they embraced this to be just a stepping stone, rather than trying to do that, while also trying to make a great origin story, the narrative would've flowed much better. At the end of the film, it was truly just a by the numbers, super hero film, that didn't take too many risks.

","After watching lots of comic book adaptations movies. I have come to the conclusion that some do not translate as well as others to the big screen. Captain America is one that to me is in need of some punch for the big screen. This movie does deliver some nice action scenes but those are few and far between - a lot of the in between fodder with his origin and back story do get bogged down with some cheesy dialog and scenes of the old USO type shows with beautiful but boring girls glamorizing the war and using Caps image for propaganda. Main thing is , of all the Marvel heroes that have been made into movie roles , Captain America IMO is one that may be a tough sell for a sequel. I mean he has been around a long time in comics but do people really follow him ,not until he was supposedly killed off in a recent storyline did people take notice with even some news stations like CNN doing a whole story on a fictional characters' death. Like with Superman when they killed him off and then of course the character ends up not being dead and brought back which is done quite a lot in the fictional comic book world ,usually to bolster falling sales of the comic book which is what happened for both Superman and Cap when the writers had them both bumped off albeit temporarily. So now people are interested in Cap again but for how long , is he as exciting as some of the other characters. In the comics , I say hell yes but on screen that's iffy . They need to really go no holes barred with him , I mean he has lots of great enemies and co heroes to work with and so much material for stories. If they do it right , Captain America could be a serious blockbuster franchise like Spiderman but if they do it cheesy with a bad director and tepid writing you can kiss it goodbye.

And the scenes before he becomes Captain America are quite boring to be honest I would like this movie a lot more if he was started punching Nazi's earlier. Another complaint might be that their isn't as much Nazi punching as there should be, its only really in one montage (admittedly a great montage).

","It is obvious that Captain America is an enormously popular flick, and although there will always be people who find some fault in one aspect or another, just looking at the numbers makes it clear that this movie strikes a chord in the hearts of a good majority of Americans. Many people have already given their opinions on the movie itself – whether or not it follows the original storyline well enough, or whether or not the characters were believable enough – and I have nothing novel to say on that point. However, I do want to point out some of the themes that struck me within the movie because I firmly believe that Captain America's popularity springs from something deeper within it. We've seen Hollywood spit out one action flick after another, but not all of them have the same appreciation, so what's the deal with this one? Captain America's action scenes are cool but they're really not any more stunning than the next movie, it has comedic elements without being overly funny, and there is very little in the way of sexual material to grab the audience's attention. No, I think the reason for Captain America's popularity lies in its themes of character and sacrifice.",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

","The next chapter in the Avengers saga has arrived. And, like Thor before it, it is dumb, big, and loud. However, this is slightly less dumb than most action movies these days, because of two main factors. One of these is the film's style. In an uncommon twist of the comic book subgenre, this is an undeniable period piece. WWII-style dialogue, cinematography, and technology are everywhere, and could not have provided a better backdrop for the action taking place on the screen. However, it is at this point that I think the film could use some improvement. The action scenes simply were not that compelling or entertaining. Honestly, this is the last complaint I expected to have about this movie, given that Thor and Joe Johnston's previous film, The Wolfman, both had this as their selling points. However, the dialogue was one of the finer points of the film. It was better-written than I had expected, and that's no small thing. The other main positive factor of this film is that it has a message. Unlike the last two Marvel movies, this one has a theme that most, if not all, people can get behind: simply that, no matter who or what you are, if you try hard enough, you can make a difference. This is something that the lead actor, Chris Evans (Scott Pilgrim) exemplifies extremely well. He plays both the pre- and post-op Steve Rogers with great emotion and deftness. Oh, and for all you Marvel fans, there are A LOT of little nods to Thor and Iron Man, as well as other (read: non-Marvel) stuff.",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

","I was an avid reader of the Captain America comic up until the mid-nineties, about the time it seemed to be coming off the rails (about the time he got caught in the meth lab explosion). I think it was revitalized later and gained popularity as a result (he was saved by a Red Skull blood transfusion? Bucky Barnes resurfaces as a villain, the Winter Soldier! The discovery of a black Captain America from WWII! a Super Hero civil war--culminating in Cap beating up Iron Man(!?) Wow! I dropped off at THE wrong time, apparently). Still, I was delighted that they were making a gigantic summer movie out of it and getting fully behind it. Top-notch talent was being put together for the project with the SFX to go with. The result is what I expected: A huge, action-packed (though it does drag a bit at times) movie that's immensely entertaining. They really get the character right, as best as a condensed movie version could be expected to. It's amazing how the writers and director deal with how he becomes Captain America, how he gets his abilities, how he gets his name (he's a propaganda piece, selling war bonds). The costume he uses on his U.S. bond tour is just about exactly the one from the comic (sans chain mail). Then, when Rogers chances upon real action, his costume is modified for real combat. There are some bad one-liners in it, which shows that the production may have been more rushed than, say, Thor or Iron Man, which where more polished. But overall I found that Joe Johnston (highly underrated as a director) finds just the right combination of heart, fantasy, and action here.

","Let me start by getting one thing clear, Captain America is not a bad film. Just a major let down at least for me. It is actually quite alright movie overall but that is overshadowed by the disappointment streaming from because of what it could have been. It felt like it could and even would succeed in being more than just the average Marvel superhero movie. The trailers seemed really promising but after having seen the whole film one realises that there was nothing more than what was shown in the trailers and also stuff looked like being great turns out to be not quite so much. The set up is practically the usual becoming a true hero idea but still gets some fresh feel being set during WWII which I feel is not just a set piece and works fine. Even with the serious tone it sets there are some standard superhero silly stuff but never that it takes the overhand, it works quite alright. The tone, settings and old fashioned war music are the good parts of this. But sadly the lesser good parts seem to weigh over. The action which not seldom are the central parts of superhero movies feel really weak. Some critics have pointed out and enjoyed the kind of old time fight scenes, comparing them to Indiana Jones. OK they are old styled but that doesn't automatically make it great. The problems are a total lack of suspense or thrills, one never ever gets any feeling of excitement of what will happen and what cap will do next. Yes I know he is the hero and can't be really defeated but still one can create interest in action scenes involving those also. The cast is kind of good. Tommy Lee Jones is best not surprisingly. But Chris Evans just does not quite catch it, he looks cool once he's become Cap but the charm and substance in the performance to create any real relation between him and the audience is missing. When one is supposed the feel some sympathy or whatever I just give it a shrug of the shoulders. Red Skull is another failure. He seems to just fill the role that a hero needs a enemy. Hugo Weaving doesn't do a bad performance the problem is rather the directing or script. A villain in this kind of film is not scary but Red Skull is neither interesting, he is just there because he must. He is doing some evil stuff but at the end I've just forgotten what it was and why. A weak bad guy doesn't really create any thrill for the good guys fight against him. The rest of the minor roles are however perfectly alright, Hayley Atwell, Toby Jones and Stanley Tucci all very good. None of the Joe Johnston movies have had much of character development. I was worried when I first heard he was making Captain America. So I understand almost all I've pointed out here is negative but the thing is that the movie was such a disappointment and could definitely have been better. It's a alright movie but nothing more. It's better than THOR but my anticipation for The Avengers has declined again, which began with Iron Man 2.

One of the things i found very boring and also needed to be shorted or taken out was the part where captain America was promoting war bonds and rallying up the troops in the old costume it went on for far to long and I was sitting there thinking can we get to the next bit. Another part I found really underused was the bike chase scene I feel that he should of used his shield to take them out it would of been quick but it would of also been entertaining to watch. The characters were also a let down extremely but the worst was the red skull didn't find at all evil or menacing what so ever he cared to much about world domination and less on crushing captain America and the hydra which made no sense. But the worst part of the entire film was the final where Steve rogers wakes up in the modern age but we don't know what year because they do not specify anytime in the film besides the 1940's and the the avengers tie in was just ridiculous and rushed it seemed like they just wanted it out the way and it was like they were saying to us the avengers is coming dumb and stupid.,/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

","This is, without a doubt going to be one of my top 10 movies of 2011, quite possibly the number one film. You can rest assured that Captain America is an absolutely amazing movie. I'm so glad Marvel got in to the solo movie making business. Instead of leasing out their characters to other studios, they're making movies themselves and have not missed yet. Cap may very well be their best effort yet! This movie really takes the comic book genre to the highest level. It reinvents epic adventure by ""Marvelizing"" characters by making them more believable and more relatable. Spider-Man and the X-Men did this to a degree but only as far as their respective studios wished to stay true to the source material. Anything added or amended was for the benefit of the live action adaptation. Director Sam Raimi pulled this off by talking to the summer crowd, not down to them with the Spider-Man series. Jon Favreau did the same thing here but maybe even better with Iron Man. Now, Joe Johnson continues that tone but adds an old time movie flare which is exactly what the character calls for. He also adds nice bits of humor but not too much. Like the great films of the past, he grounds the action and the concept of a ""super soldier"" in firm reality. I've said it before but it's brave to reach for the highest common denominator with a big budget film and Captain America delivers a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity.

",First off this review may be bias because I am a Captain America fan and this movie is great. Now if you know nothing about the character then you may not like it as much but that is with any type of comic adaptation. So lets start from the beginning it starts with Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) being this small weak guy who just wants to serve his country but he can't due to his physical stature. Now thats great because it shows how this character is full of heart and it really makes him respect his power when he gets it. The middle after he becomes the captain is great he doesn't go straight to war he is selling war bonds and introduces his yes ridiculous costume. Now the villain the Red Skull is not that interesting he is just evil Nazi guy in short terms the actor who plays him does great but his story was just boring. This movie excels at all the little hints and easter eggs it does for the comic fans like having Dumb Dumb Dugan and the original Captain America costume. The end with no spoilers this ending is great the end fight with Captain America and the Red Skull is great.

","In the campy, ridiculous world of comic books, Captain America and the Red Skull have the potential to be some of the most goofy characters in a goofy universe. Thankfully, The First Avenger doesn't falter in such ways, and can actually be rather interesting to watch. The dialogue is overall done well, and the overarching narrative is well written and thought out. In my opinion, the film falters when it is forced to be a superhero movie. Because all the ideas that are brought up are very interesting, and a Nazi cult let by an insane man who believes himself a God could have been an extremely threatening foe if Captain America didn't blow up every fortress and factory they had with ease and beat them up harder than an amateur going up against Ali. I understand that superhero films have to contain a certain amount of action in order to draw in the more casual geeks, but if we've learned anything in the past few years with the explosion of the comic book movie is that audiences are open to experimentation with the formula. And a slower paced film would have much better fitted the narrative that a generic action movie that offers nothing new to that genre. The first third to half of the film was really good, but when it became just another superhero film I lost interest in it. There are a few good moments after that, but all the praise I had for the film was quickly lost after Cap suited up and went off to war with his chums.",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

Unfortunately he's just not fit enough. After trying several times and being rejected as medically unfit he is spotted by a scientist Dr Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) who is impressed by his relentlessness. He has him recruited to a special scientific division under the command of Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) in the care of sexy English agent Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell). Rogers is picked for a pioneering experiment to create a super soldier.

817,9 March 2017,yvonneshusband,10," The Best Superhero Origin Story Yet!
","Sorry, Nolan. Your Batman origin movie is very good, but this is far better. First and foremost of the reasons why: it doesn't take liberties with the comic book version to facilitate its own plot. Second, Chris Evans is absolutely spot-on casting for the brave, righteous but sickly young man who becomes America's living secret weapon in the fight against the Nazis; despite his limitations as an actor he projects all the qualities the role requires without resorting to a ridiculous growling bellow while in costume. Third, it's set in a period in history we've all come to believe (or would like to believe) when a global conflict really was about 'good vs evil'; 'Captain America' fits perfectly into the role of a hero for that age, giving his subsequent projection into the modern world, with its relativistic moral view of conflict far greater force. Fourth, the character established in this origin movie remains constant in his future appearances in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, unlike the subsequent iterations of Nolan's Batman. It is the constancy of Cap's character that 'assembles' the superhero team in 'Avengers Assemble', unites it in 'Age of Ultron' and ultimately destroys it in 'Civil War'. By contrast, Nolan's Bruce Wayne grows weary of his crusade against crime in 'The Dark Knight' and seeks to pass the task on to Harvey Dent so as to preserve his relationship with Rachel Dawes (all three developments contrary to Batman canon). In 'Rises', the character is portrayed as an imbecile who understands neither the basic principles of tactics nor elementary detective work. Fifth, Tommy Lee Jones. Sixth, its ending isn't shamelessly ripped off from the train fight in 'Spider-Man 2' (a better movie) and the subway train crash sequence from 'Die Hard with a Vengeance' (an equally good film, but with a far better executed 'crash' sequence than 'Begins').Production and costume design are first rate, particularly Cap's 'operational dress', the interiors of the SSR HQ (clearly based on the actual Churchill War Rooms)and the Valkyrie bomber, the 'exteriors' of 1940s New York and the Red Skull's six-wheel automobile.

Leaving Rogers the loan subject to be paraded around the country to gain support for the troops, until he gets word that his friend Bucky has been captured, and even though Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) tells him not to, Rogers saves his friend's life along with several other troops. In the wake of this event Rogers is awarded his own team to lead as they go in to clean up Nazi Germany.

I'm looking forward for The Avengers and I'm sure it'll be pretty good. Captain America: The First Avenger (By the way, I have no idea why did they call it The First Avenger cause Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Hulk, The Incredible Hulk and Thor were all released before Captain American, so it should be called Captain America: The Last Avenger, but whatever...) is just an attempt of an extraordinary movie, I mean, it provides fun and entertainment, it also brings action and some other good stuff, but it's just not that great and Iron Man is out of its league. I liked Captain American pretty much, it's entertaining and enjoyable, but, I didn't like many things about it, first of all, I hated the fact that the movie's bad guy is a guy with a red and weird head, second of all, I hated that Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) was a weak kid with a very low height and he was always being beaten up by people and he was accepted to go to war, one day, he's sent to try an experience that will give him super abilities, when he tries it, he grows up (on height) and he gets huge muscles and then, right when he owns those powers, something bad happens and all the certain, he starts running like crazy, throwing things, swimming inside water to catch a submarine and later, someone asks him something and he responds ""I'm just a kid from Brooklyn"", like if he was awesome just cause he got muscles, I mean, how annoying is that? But whatever, despite the fact that it's very flawed, Captain American is a good superhero movie about war and stuff. I liked it's concept, I liked its concept and I liked its cast. Here's a simple superhero movie that entertains and leaves you enjoyed, I don't highly recommend it, but I do recommend it, it's an okay movie that leads the countdown to the beginning of The Avengers to its end.

In this movie he battles Nazis and an evil antagonist named ""Red Skull"". The technology level of both sides in the conflict is high and it gives you the feeling of an alternate universe. The quality of the production and props is state of the art and Chris Evans isn't a worse superhero as others, although his acting is not going to win against the likes of Robert Downey, Tom Hiddlestone or Jeremy Renner, to name just a few other actors in the superhero genre. Someone said that Hugo Weavings figure looks ridiculous and there's some truth behind, but hey - how about ""Hellboy""? Speaking of ""Hellboy"", the connection between Erskine and Rogers could have been displayed in a more deep, more emotional manner, although I have to admit, that ""Hellboys"" relationship to Bruttenholm is one of many years. The romance level is thankfully small and Hayley Atwell reminded me so much of Kate Beckinsale. I'm not used to reading any DC or Marvel comics, but I enjoyed all the little hints to the Marvel universe. As an introduction to a new superhero for cinematic use, ""Captain America"" is well narrated and gives plenty of opportunities to go deeper into character development or just more action with more bad ass antagonists.

","Relying on the reputation Marvel Studios has created over a period of time, I finally thought of giving a shot to Captain America: the First Avenger. But, seriously, I regret wasting my one and a half hour on such a film. I mean, such a film would have been justified if made in 70s or early 80s. Acting-disappointment, story-disappointment, execution- disappointment. For god'sake if you don't know how to make a period superhero film then don't, do not destroy the character completely. Start was a little good, but as soon as he is convinced to become a national hero, the film loses itself completely. Didn't like Captain America's transformation from an elite army men to a sort of superhero.. His sacrifice for country was although meant serious but was completely humiliating, the end 1 minute however, was really good I would say but that again was connected to a very unrealistic event.

841,31 July 2014,thedudeabides-2,7," Admirable effort for a rather dull superhero
","When you take a look at the line up for Marvel's Avengers Assemble it's easy to see where a lot of the fun and excitement is going to come from. You have Iron Man, with a suit of armour that can do almost anything including fly – The Incredible Hulk, who turns into an oversized green giant with superhuman strength- Thor, who is an actual God with the ability to control lightening. Then we have Captain America, who has a shield. And so it is perhaps inevitable that, of all Marvel's origin movies, Captain America:The First Avenger feels the least exciting. That is not to say it isn't enjoyable, or even fun, but it often pales in comparison to what came before it. A lot of this is down to the fact that Captain America, as a character, is actually rather dull and his overly patriotic manner can be a little grating when it's being digested in the cynical 21st century. Still, Chris Evans does a wonderful job of portraying Steve Rogers as a wannabe soldier with a heart of gold and the body of Where's Wally. Due to his extreme physical shortcomings, Rogers volunteers himself for an experiment in which he will become a super soldier with all the skills associated with it. It's a solid origin story and makes up for an enjoyable first half with director Joe Johnston's decision to frame the action in a 50's setting also allowing Cap to retain his goofy patriotism without it ever feeling out of place. The problem comes when Marvel realises it also needs a supervillain with a suitably evil masterplan for Captain America to foil, leading to Hugo Weaving's woeful interpretation of Red Skull and some nonsense involving alien technology. It makes little to no sense, it wastes not only Hugo Weaving, but also Toby Jones and it all leads up to the most anti- climactic ending that Marvel have ever produced. This was always going to be a tricky prospect for Marvel when you consider the rest of their line up. Yet, despite a number of flaws, Captain America is by no means terrible and will certainly whet your appetite for some fun superhero action.",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

","Captain America was a character I was obsessed with but knew little to nothing about the character. I think it was because at this point, I knew that this Universe was going somewhere. That it was real, and an Avengers movie was underway. Again, I didn't see this one in the cinema. But I really tried to. I finally got the chance to see it a few months later and left the film extremely underwhelmed by the film and character. Over time it has changed, but I, personally, don't understand audience's strong appreciation for The First Avenger.
POSITIVES!
The plot is enjoyable. It's interesting to have a period piece set in a comic book film, but also set around one of Marvel's icons. Chris Evans stars in the title role and for the character he was given, Evans does a very acceptable job. Evans in this role hadn't received the exact praise that I give him now but was still a good performance. The real standout was the gorgeous and talented Hayley Atwell as Agent Peggy Carter. Not just a strong female character, but just a great character. Evans and Atwell shared incredible chemistry onscreen. Although I wasn't a major fan of her spin-off series, I was still happy she got the reception the character and actress deserved. Tommy Lee Jones is always an entertaining presence, so it was great to see him. Hugo Weaving as the Red Skull was awesome. Just the perfect choice to deliver that character. Joe Johnston directs this project and he does a fine job. As a director, he can create an incredible atmosphere that really feels like a throwback to '40s cinema and just that time period. This is also a praise to the sets and the costumes within the picture. I really enjoy this Captain America uniform. There's a lot of inspiration taken from the Ultimates run, but we also get the classic suit which is a lot of fun. The shield that Cap uses is such an obscure weapon but is very memorable for its prop and sound design. The score and music utilized in the film is another cool throwback to that time period and is quite catchy.
MIXED!
A big mixed element on the borderline of a negative for me would be the writing. Although I enjoyed the look of the film and so forth, as a war film it feels very held back. I understand that they couldn't go too dark with it, but they could've explored deeper themes and have some controlled imagery. This would've made Cap's ideals and characteristics stronger for the character he was. Even though he does these impossible things that makes him a legend, I didn't find him to be a ""legend"" character. A problem I had with the Red Skull was that he felt like a cliché villain. Wasn't bad, just had the feeling of recurrence.
NEGATIVES!
It's probably not an editing issue but it's an issue. The amount of montages in this film, glossing over very important events, is unacceptable. As soon as Cap is on the frontlines of the war, the film goes into montage-madness. Basically, skipping over what could've made Cap a stronger character in this film. Something else that would be a major con would be the CGI. So many shots and visuals are clearly fake. Shots of an obvious greenscreen. Not as bad as some films, but still disrupting.
CONCLUSION!
So, Captain America: The First Avenger is a film that a lot of audiences enjoy, and some audiences have grown to appreciate. For me this film feels rushed. It feels as if that they needed a Captain America film, but Avengers was right around the corner. I think if the filmmakers took a few more risks with exploring WWII. Quicker storytelling so we get to see Cap in more of a war setting. Really adapt some of those incredible concept arts, making this one of the darker entries into the MCU than this would've been one of their greatest films.",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

This movie was enjoyable, I was not bored while watching it but it was not as action packed as I had heard it was. I found that with any movies that introduce a comic book hero, this was filled with more dialogue and background history than the actual daily adventures that makes one a super hero that we love to watch. However, the acting was good in this movie, nothing over the top. I like the choice for Captain America, as I feel Chris Evans carries the charm of the underdog that we all cheer for. The reason why this movie did not get a 8,9 or 10 out of 10 was because I didn't feel the excitement that I usually feel during super hero films. Overall, it is a good movie but it will not be added to my favorites list.",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

","I really like Captain America as a Marvel character. He is very interesting to me. He is intelligent, charismatic, and opinionated. What he is not, is a singing and dancing monkey. I rented this movie a few days ago because I saw Hugo Weaving was in it so I decided I would give it a go. But all the movie turned out to be was a set up, explaining how the f*** he ended up in the modern world with the rest of the Avengers. If it wasn't the overly modernized technology and the villain who was a poor rip-off of the G.I.Joe: Rise of Cobra movie villain (who wasn't particularly intelligent EITHER), I would have to say the downfall of the movie was the musical number. Beyond that fact, it is STILL stuck in my head (""The star spangled man with a plan""). That and (*and this is the spoiler*) he falls and love with this woman, Peggy, and then lands a plane in the arctic and is cryogenically frozen, apparently. He's discovered by us, modern Americans, and then he breaks out, ends up in the middle of Times Square, freaking out, and Nick Fury appears out of nowhere as if traffic didn't exist and tells him he's in the future, to which his response was ""...I had a date."" And that's the last line of the movie. I assumed that at the very least, he would find 90-year-old Peggy in a nursing home and dance with her. But no, we're left hanging about poor old Peggy and he just chills in the middle of Times Square looking sad and confused.

","Right. So the first thing I definitely liked about the movie was the choice for the role of Caps. Chris Evans truly looks perfect for this role. I saw his ideal face in in the red, white and blue costume, and, as cheesy as it sounds, I actually thought that he truly looks like an Amerian hero. His determined look and serious Brooklyn dialect goes amazingly well with the portrayal of this iconic character. And this is not cheesy (I'm addressing the people, unfamiliar with this character right here) because Captain America is one of the first major comic book heroes in history. He's as equally important, if not more, as Superman. And that is why the film makers made him look so 'flawless'. Because he comes from a REALLY long time ago. Even the story is set in the 40's, when the superhero world was much simpler. Good guys were good. Bad guys were bad. That's it. Not like modern superhero's, where's there's a twist around every corner, and the bad guy turns out to be the good guy, and the good guy turns out to be the bad guy, and so on... I was really glad to finally get a really simple, but quite enjoyable hero in a movie to lay my eyes upon. Of course Chris Evans was not the only star of the film. The cast is superb (Tommy Lee Jones, Hugo Weaving, Stanley Tucci, etc.). Hugo Weaving surely gives an equally impressive performance next to Chris Evans. Probably even more impressive. He really managed to pull of the German accent portraying the German Nazi evildoer. Also a very clear character. A perfect bad guy, with no noble or kind values. Pure evil. The only problem about Hugo Weaving in this picture was that there was too little screen time for his role. His character was really appealing to me. Frankly, Hugo Weaving was actually the first reason, I wanted to go see this film. And it turned out to be a similar situation to Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"". Everyone who loved that film, loved it for one good reason - Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker (of course that's not the only good thing about that movie). And as many times as I see ""the Dark knight"", I can not get enough of the Joker. I wanted him to get more screen time. And it's the same with Hugo Weaving here. He could definitely had more on screen time. It felt as if Hugo Weaving wasn't 'maxed out'. And all of the other characters are really appealing because of their 'simplicity'.

Steve has trials in boot camp that allow him to showcase his ingenuity, resolve, and dedication. Not since Madonna has such Ambition grabbed America by the balls. With a little help from Howard Stark, who has one hand in the future, and the other on a random hot-dame's tushie, Steve is injected, erected, electrocuted, and pretty much comes out the other side as Marvel's American Adonis. It's like he read one issue of Men's Health, and all the tips worked! (!!!) The tone of the movie is self-effacing yet sure-footed. I was only annoyed by the line, ""This is not about me"". How many Marvel Movies about Chris Evans must he remind us that it's not all about him? (???) Peggy, the love interest is pitch-perfect as a tough-as-nails high-brass broad who doesn't just dance with anyone. Bucky is strangely Steve's Age, and almost gets a hero moment before he falls off the train. There's some fun Iron Man post-foreshadowing (wrap your head around that), and we see where Tony Stark gets his mojo, his moulah, and his machines. The Red Skull could have benefited from a bit more back story, but he is serviceable, and no one sheds a tear when he suffers Odin's wrath (wrap your head around that one, too). Captain America is a feel-good ego boost at a time when we are all at each other's throats. I honestly never questioned whether Cap was a Democrat or a Republican. He certainly didn't seem concerned with what tax bracket he was in. There was enough multiculturalism in the cast to feel good about. And for the first time, a 3D moment really got me, and I actually flinched. ***Big Spoiler*** There is ""The Avengers"" trailer at the end, which feels kind of cheap and breaks tradition of having an credits end-cap scene. It was slick, and unfortunately only showed Scarlet Johannson as a female Avenger. So far from the female buffet Marvel served up in the X-Men flicks.

","Up front you should know that I went into this movie knowing nothing of the characters and their backgrounds, so my review is from an entirely comic-book clueless perspective. That being said IMO, As far as comic book hero movies go, captain America fills the bill. It's got everyone and everything it need that makes it an entertaining and memorable. Leading man Chris Evans does well, pre and post captain America transformation. His believable vulnerability and noble ideas make him (of course) a hero worth looking up to. The only bone I have to pick with the studly Evans is in his voice. Various times in the movie he mentions his brooklyn background, and each time it (to me) awkwardly pointed out his obvious lack of the subsequent accent he should have had. Otherwise, he wore the outfit well, was impressively sized, and did a great job staying true to the small guy persona in a tough guy body. Hayley Atwell portrays Peggy, the female of the film. I don't have any criticism for her acting, but I wasn't thrilled with her character as a whole...it almost came across as one dimensional. I suppose it's not a big deal, as this is a comic book film and the women there are primarily there to be the love interest for the hero, but I was left thinking the character deserved more then the role of the sharp shooting beauty. Hugo Weaving's red skull has a (fitting) scary sort of German Voldemort-y feel to him, so no complaints there. The same goes for the rest of the well- wordrobed supporting cast; a very well chosen out group of actors. I did not see this film in 3D, but the special effects were cool without having them thrown in my face. Also the effect that put Evans's head on a scrawny body for the beginning of the film was *seamless* and impressive. In summation, the film did what it set out to do and did it well. It is what it is, and what it is is a lot of fun. It's the journey of a lovable hero, set in a world war two backdrop. In the world of comic book hero movies, Captain America is definitely high on the list.",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

The red skull was a really fun character and a perfect villain for Captain America's first movie, and they chose the perfect actors for the Captain and the Red Skull. Honestly all of the actors did a great job in this movie, even getting me a little choked up watching Bucky slip away. The story and pacing was also well handled and to see such a believed character treated with as much love as he was I am happy to say I was able to experience it.

He wants to serve his country by joining the army, however he is too small and physically weak to pass the boot camp training. Lucky for him the good guys have just cooked up a Super Solider Serum. Since Steve is such a noble patriot he is chosen to be part of the super soldier experiment. The experiment is successful and he becomes Captain America. Unfortunately, everything after Steve becomes Captain America is just plain awful. The first half of the movie was pretty good. There was nice sets, the boot camp scenes were enjoyable, and CGI they used to put the head of Chris Evans on that small body was seamless. However the entire second half is terrible. We went from a well done period piece with nice sets and characters to a dumb action movie where a superhero wrapped in an American flag fights Nazis with laser guns. All of the world war 2 centric action is glossed over in a 30 second montage. Instead most of the action is between Captain America and an evil Nazi group led by the Red Skull. Red Skull is an awful villain. Whereas Captain America is pure good, Red Skull is pure evil. He is a very cliché bad guy, his motives make no sense, and his evil plan is laughable. For the most part the second half of the movie is just a bunch of dumb action. Despite it being world war 2 there is no realism or grit to any of the action sequences. There is a funny looking superhero fighting against a funny looking Nazi with a red head, all the while there is a bunch of lasers firing everywhere. The CGI in the second half is so fake looking and is a big part of why the action looks as bad as it does. Overall the second half of the story is nonsensical, the action is forgettable, the villain is a joke, and Captain America just isn't that interesting.

I've never really been a fan of Marvel's villains (except maybe Thanos), so I had mixed expectations walking into the theater. And...my skepticism was correct, because Red Skull is NOT a good villain, by any standards. In my opinion, he's easily one of the WORST Marvel villains because of his boring, predictable dialogue and unconvincing appearance. Another problem I had with this movie was its memorability. Surprisingly, when I think of the trilogy this movie is the hardest to remember. Shocking because this is literally his ORIGIN STORY! It's supposed to be memorable AND better than the sequels!! SO how is ""The Winter Soldier"" and ""Civil War"" the movies that pop up first when I think about the Captain America trilogy? I really love how the movie ends with Cap saying, ""I had a date.""

I never really liked this character, but after seeing him in ""the Avengers"" in 2012, I decided to get acquainted with his films. And you know, this movie is really stupid, kind of like the first Spider-Man from Sam Raimi. Chris Evans doesn't annoy me as much as Tobey Maguire does... Okay, I got carried away, back to Cap.
Looks the film well. The atmosphere of war and America of that time is tolerably transferred. The effects also do not cause facepalm. The plot, as I said, is a bit silly, just like in the old comics.
The main character of the film, Steve Rogers-a typical hero, nothing more to say.
Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) at first seems like a typical female character, but gradually reveals new sides, and when you see her emotions, her experiences at the time of Steve's ""death"" in the ice, you believe it without question. And in the series she is generally fine. And besides, Hayley is such a woman that... Again I was carried away.
The main antagonist of the film, the Red Skull performed by Hugo ""Agent Elrond Smith"" Weaving terribly caricatured, though it looks good.
Watch can be, but his, as and many films MCU, not very want to revise.",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

","This is utter drivel. It reminds me of green hornet, which was up till now the worst comic book movie of 2011. This however sets a whole new standard and might be a contender for worst professional production with a serious budget, ever. It is impossible to assess whether the characters or the cardboard cutout decors are the thinnest. Arnold Schwarzenegger was frankly a more credible actor in Red Sonia and the Conan movies then the cast of this misbegotten drama. Sebastian Stan proves that none of the Gossip Girl cast can act, and Tommy Lee Jones phones in his performance in order to stay within shouting distance of the rest.

","First I have got to say the reason I am writing this is the gut wrenching feeling I got in my stomach of all the bad written reviews of this film by people who just quite frankly don't know comics, understand and from the sounds of it is just the wrong person for anything comic related. This is a comic book movie based on one the oldest marvel super-heroes, a character that was created during the war by one of the legends because she was an exceptionally patriotic man and figured the best way for him to help the effort was make comics about super-heroes and the war. So far most of the bad reviews I've read on this movie focus on a few things which make me face palm. As follows 1. Wtf is this Hydra?! Where are the Nazis?! And similar complaints about red skull being a bad character with no backstory given (even though sufficient backstory is given to his creation) and the movie explains that hydra is a nazi science division, this is not only straight frm comics but straight from the established origin, without hydra there isn't really a captain America 2. Technology too advanced, characters unbelievable in abilities. These people clearly missed the point that this is a marvel comic book movie where the evil villain's plot revolves around a very powerful Norse god energy source....why do you expect realism with that? And really all the weapons did was release that energy in controlled bursts, they didn't develop this new energy source, they found it in the first 10 minutes of the movie. And captain America is a super hero, a super human, that is the point of him, he has unbelievable strength and speed (for a human) if you don't like that, see another movie 3. It's just another America flag waving feel good movie, LAME! seriously I'm a Canadian, and captain America is in my top ten all time favourites, I love my country, my people and I'm not entirely fond of the American military or government, but I love the cap, mostly because he isn't about blind patriotism to the stars and stripes (anymore) and stands for the ideals of the flag, not the flag itself (despite being a walking flag, he more recently went completely against the American government during Marvel's Civil War because of ideals) back during the war this was very much more blatant patriot propaganda basically and very much he was the patriot and if the movie followed that same format I would agree with them , but the movie tries very hard to establish that what makes cap great is his heart, not the flag that's strapped to him and shows the whole captain America thing is literally marketing to sell him. The movie is called captain America, there's a lot of history to the character, respect what he was during the war (also the first comic book movie which was made during the war) ",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

The acting in this film was perfect, I myself not being able to pick out one actor who I thought didn't do well. The plot of the film does feel a little split, but besides that it is a very great story, with the film getting me to care about the characters and events in the first 20 or so minutes. The story introduces the audience too a bite sized portion of prominent MCU characters without overwhelming you with to many. If you try to think of this movie as a war film, you will be disappointed in every aspect, despite picking up the WW2 theme it did, this is still a Superhero film.

","like all marvel movies i made the case of seeing this film in the cinema and not waiting for it to be released on DVD/blu-ray, and like all other marvel movies i went to see it with my close group of friends and among ourselves the movie has been decused many times. captain America is the retelling of the ""comic classic"" origins story of the loved hero captain America and in a somewhat common marvel movie style with a few twists and changes that alter the story but with the up-most loyalty to the original work. the movies style is not that of Christopher Nolan's dark knight trilogy and although the three movies are enjoyable this doesn't make captain America bad. captain America excels as what it is an action movie with essence and story (i am willing to admit the development of characters in the story is not as strong as in other movies, this is disappointing as much of ""caps"" development was cut from avengers). Nolan's movies or story driven to the core but doing movies like this is not alway good movies would not be as big if they were all citizen Kane a ""three hour"" duration that completely engulfs you and your concentration making it a bad film to go see with your friends when your looking to see some explosions and action. i also disagree with the other site of the coin with movies like Micheal bay travesty transformers which was explosions, some teasing of flesh and the selling out of a loved children's cartoon for nothing but finical gain. the movie picks up rather slow but convincing we meet Steve rogers/captain America in a movie theatre watching a war propaganda film of the day were a local jock type man taunts and laughs at the film the small rogers then engages the boy in a fight out side the movie theatre refusing to give up the losing fight until he is saved by his best friend Bucky who has just signed up to join the war effort. the sign is probably the most important of rogers early development showing his over commitment to defending what he believes in most (there is also a little cheesy foreshadowing of the use of a shield. as the movie progresses it is revealed that rogers has attempted unsuccessfully many times to enlist. following the story Steve eventually meets a scientist who gives him power etc. read the synopsis if you want to now. the movie introduces the villains hydra and red skull. and a montage of the war years follows.then following the death of a good friend ""cap"" jumps on a bike provokes a high paced action sequence, gets the girl and saves the day not before making his own sacrifice, re-awaking in the modern day a few weeks/month before avengers. the movies villain red skull was wonderfully portrayed and i would once again love to see him in the role if he didn't express his complete dislike of the idea. thourgh-out the movie he always wells menacing comparable to a dilled-back Hannibal lector completely in control, overly intelligent and with some super powers and Nazi stuff threw in just for fun his plan holds solid as he wants to take over the world but believes everyone even Hitler is unfit to lead. the characters back story is never explored in-depth only hinted at making it promising for a return of the villain.",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

The thing that impressed me most was how they put in the necessary Avengers info with out being *too much* or bringing down the story. I had trouble deciding how the combat would be incorporated besides a run of the mill gun display, especially out of a cartoon. However the director, Joe Johnston and the writers, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, did an exceptional job with how they spiced up fight scenes. Chris Evans and Hugo Weaving adapt to their roles quite well. Evans is pretty much what everyone who grew up with Captain America would expect in the role. Weaving was not who one would expect in the role of Johann Schmidt/Red Skull besides, perhaps, his unforgettable performances as antagonists in The Matrix trilogy, the current Transformers and many more. I wasn't sure he would fit the role but I was impressed, especially because his character was built extremely poorly. There aren't any points in the movie where one is bored even in the slightest. Overall this is an undoubted See It! The main reason I would say it isn't higher is because of some slightly overly used scenes that have been appearing in many superhero movies recently.

Not knowing the comic effectively disqualifies me in the eyes of many; however, we are talking about movies here, therefore I will write a couple of sentences. The movie heavily resembles ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"". It has much higher budget, a bit weaker cast, and it is not as aesthetically accomplished, but plot details aside, Captain America is a brash echo of the Sky Captain. The Comic books, however, preceded the Sky Captain movie, - nevertheless, it was questionable to use cliché aesthetics. Speaking of the cast, Hugo Weaving is really good as long as he is allowed to use his face, and a letdown once the stupid mask replaces it. The lady ... sorry, I have almost forgotten her. The Captin himself - it could have been worse, but given the considerable flatness of the character, I think he did a good job. But the best friend ... sorry, he did not persuade me. The movies as a whole was rather boring. Too predictable even for a person who is not familiar with the comic book. And the generous amount of CGI. Explosions, - tons of them, and so boring.

Overall, a good movie but the MCU certainly has a lot better stuff, including this movie's sequel, Captain America: The Winter Soldier.",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

","Despite a low rating, I love this movie. The captain is likeable and the story itself goes smooth without any boring parts. If I will need to say some negative thing, then it will be a weak villain. A big plus for me is a retro atmosphere which gives the movie a nice vibes.",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011

","82/100
This is the first film in my watch through of the mcu in chronological order on rewatch. It was just as good as I remember with some very in depth characters and a cool story. The first half of the movie was much stronger than the second imo because it set up Steve as a character. I felt that the second half contained too much action with less interesting story.

1073,5 January 2014,Who95,7," Marvel's most peculiar
","When you make a movie based on something, you have to make it independent from its source, yet not unrecognizable. That's what Johnston did with elegance and ability. Indeed Captain America is not just a nice movie amongst other superhero movies. What's mostly peculiar of this movie is its 'retro' style. It really seems an adventure movie from the 80s, due to its simple plot, soft tone and pleasant pace. It looks and sounds like an older movie with modern special effects. And those special effects are generally nice; CGI is 'less intrusive' than it is in other superhero movies. The only noticeably digital thing in the movie is the bad guy... and here's the main flaw, in my opinion. He just looks fake and inappropriate, he doesn't work... He doesn't seem as evil as he should and his character isn't well defined. Instead, the main character is greatly developed, I really liked his story and the theme of 'doing what you can with what you have'.",/review/rw2935898/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger_(2011
