2,24 October 2015,ivo-cobra8,10," The best Marvel comic book superhero movie of 2014 so far!
","Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) is the best Marvel comic book Action Superhero movie and one of my favorite films of The Avengers! Big, busy and action-packed - like the first movie, but with better pacing. It is a huge improvement over Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) I am sorry but I don't think Joe Johnston is making a good films. He even screwed up my favorite film Jurassic Park III. Great movie! I didn't like the first Captain America but I LOVE this one. Great acting, great story, great action, great EVERYTHING. Marvel Studios continues to improve upon and expand this superhero universe and it shows with Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The action is turned up, the performances are top notch, plus with the addition of Robert Redford raises the bar yet again. Chris Evans certainly owns this role know just as Downey owns Tony Stark.

3,14 November 2020,SebMoz,9," Definietly one of the best MCU movies
","Oh man, was it good to get back to a great movie again after Thor: The Dark World. This movie, unlike that one, is well constructed, written, acted and directed. There is so much to love about the movie it's hard to name it all. The plot is well thought out and realized, complete with great twists and turns to keep you on your toes. I love the spy thriller astethic the movie presents, and it complements the more straight forward action very well. It also presents its themes of trust and morality in a solid and thoughtful way. The pacing is solid, the plot advances in a very natural way, and the movie sets up its important plot points ahead of time to make the movie more enjoyable on rewatches. The movie also does a great job with its characters. Steve, Natasha and Nick are all great characters with their own struggles, while also being very likeable, and they also have excellent chemistry. I love that Steve and Nat's relationsship isn't romantic, as that wouldn't work at all with these characters. I also really like Sam, he's sympathetic and a nice addition. The Winter Soldier is a great villain as well, which mostly comes from the fact that he is just a human, not some evil monster like so many other Marvel villains. I love watching his struggles with indentifying his past and resisting the changes made to his brain, as well as his relationsship with the hero. All this is of course helped by some solid performances from almost everyone involved. The direction is solid as well, with the perfect mix of wide shots and close-ups. The fight choreography is great, one can really feel the weight each fight carries. My only slight issue with the film is the fact that the heroes seem to be saved by plotholes a little too often, for example by a bad guy waiting to killing a good guy just long enough for something to appear to save them. It feels a little stupid, but it's not a big deal and it's pretty easy to ignore if you feel like it. Overall, this movie is extremely good. It does almost everything right, its flaws are small and inconsequental, and it's just a really entertaining movie. I recommend it to anyone who likes superhero movies, or just action movies in general.",/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014
4,10 August 2014,TheLittleSongbird,9," Excellent sequel that outdoes the first film
","That is not to knock the first Captain America film because I enjoyed that too, just that Captain America: The Winter Soldier personally came off as superior. Some of the second half does try to cram in too much giving off an at times bloated and convoluted quality, other than that Captain America: The Winter Soldier was excellent. It is a great-looking film with stylish cinematography and editing that give off a gritty and audacious look, and the special effects and the stunts are of the quality that you can't take your eyes off them. The music is not quite as good as it was in the first but it has enough of the rousing excitement and haunting intensity to make it a good score that matches what is going on on screen. The action sequences are spectacularly choreographed and of edge-of-your-seat calibre whether it is a highway car chase or a sky battle with some of the destruction authentically harrowing, and the screenplay is one that is smart and snappy with heart aplenty. The story is mostly compelling and very cleverly constructed, it mixes action, comic-book adventure and political thriller and does it in a way that is well-balanced, that is alive with nimble nuances and in a way that the film gives off a sense that it knows what it's trying to be. It's suspenseful and exciting with its fair share of themes that gives the film emotion and depth. The characters are engaging and interesting, with their personalities deeper and more expansive, and there is a much more believable villain this time around(the big reveal was actually quite surprising). A great thing considering that the cast of cast is quite large if not quite to the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink extent; the interplay between the characters works a treat also. Anthony and Joe Russo direct astutely and the acting is fine, with Chris Evans even more confident than he was in the first, Scarlett Johansson at her fearless and Anthony Mackie fitting comfortably in his role. Samuel L. Jackson is as dependable as ever, Robert Redford in a bold move gives seasoned support and is not stiff at all and Sebastian Stan is similarly authoritative. All in all, while there are a couple of issues with the second half Captain America: The Winter Soldier is an excellent sequel and manages to outdo the enjoyable first film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014
5,12 December 2020,sammielimehouse,9," Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) Review - 8.7/10
","Definitely one of the best sequels in the entire MCU. It's everything you would expect and everything you could every ask for in a Captain America sequel. There's nazis, HYDRA, Nick Fury faking his freaking death, and action. Lots of fantastic Marvel action. This isn't just one of those films that are just 95% action, 5% storytelling, one of the things this films does best is balancing story with action. For example, the Winter Soldier and Steve have some of the best fights in the MCU, but whenever Steve finds out who the Winter Soldier is, it becomes not only an amazingly choreographed fight, but also an emotional one. In conclusion, this is the first truly great MCU sequel.",/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014
6,1 August 2020,haydenluz,8," Captain America: The Winter Solider
","Captain America: The Winter Solider, directed by the best two directors that MCU has on the team, in the Russo Brothers, crafted this well directed, brisk paced spy/action film, that has a lot to be praised for. The Russo Brothers took the MCU style, and completely flipped it into their own, which completely works, while becoming a model film for the MCU. They incorporated this darker and gritter tone, that essentially grounded the film well, while inevitably throwing in some well timed humor. Even though this new approach to the MCU was a breath of fresh air, the Russo Brothers set themselves up for some nitpicks, by transforming some things that were already set and stone, for the most part.",/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014

8,27 April 2020,arnohardwell-41638,10," Maybe the best MCU movie
","The fact that I rate this movie with 10 is not an exaggeration. This particular movie I really consider to be the best of MCU as the character development, the story, the action scenes, the direction and many more details still shock you.It could be said that this is a political drama with a strong Marvel dose in it. The dialogues are also excellent and careful written as well as the casting.
I understand that many other movies like Infinity War, Avengers etc. are considered by most to be 'better', but if you watch this specific movie twice or more, you will realize that you are facing a masterpiece in all respects. In most parts of it, you think that you are in the movie and you feel that you are experiencing the emotions of the characters. In my humble personal opinion, I will repeat that Captain America: Winter Soldier is a masterpiece and will always be my number one Marvel movie.",/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014

","""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" gives super-hero sequels a good name. Not only is this $170 million blockbuster far better than its superb 'origins' predecessor, but it also is a real game-changer for the Marvel Universe. Former ""Fantastic Four"" actor Chris Evans reprises the title role as Steve Rogers, a 90-pound weakling turned 240-pound heavyweight, whose exploits inspired millions in World War II. Remember Rogers spent about 70 years in suspended animation in an iceberg after he contributed to the defeat the Nazis as well as Hydra. Rogers maintains his sense of honor, or naivety, throughout all his trials and tribulations. Evans makes his old-fashioned, nice-guy antics appear both convincing and charming. Meaning, Captain America remains essentially a goody-two-shoes-bachelor-with-a-shield. Our hero takes a licking but keeps on ticking despite whatever adversaries he tangles with in the second, in-name-only theatrical ""Captain America"" feature.",/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014

","Captain America: The Winter Soldier is the third film in Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (after last year's Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World). Compared with the mighty giant green monster, the hammer wielding Norse thunder god or the 'genius, philanthropist, billionaire, playboy' armor man, the Captain was never quite as appealing as the rest of the 'Unusuals'. Steve Rogers is portrayed as an old-fashioned, straightforward, honest, courageous, sincere, patriotic superhero. This makes him a less-interesting, boring character.

","This is the best of the Phase 2 Marvel movies. It's what ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation"" should have been. While its definitely the most serious of the movies, it still manages to have little moments of subtle humor that we've all loved since ""Iron Man."" Nick Fury plays his biggest part yet in this movie, and Black Widow is an important factor in the plot as well. Even though this is a superhero movie, it's not just turn off your brain and enjoy. It has a complex plot that you have to pay attention to. As always stay halfway through the credits, and until the end. Both scenes are extremely important to the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

","With Rogers, Fury, and Romanoff previously established, directors Joe and Anthony Russo do a magnificent job at expanding these characters – along with some secondary characters we've seen before – providing more depth to understanding their actions and how they will affect future stories. Sam Jackson has a stronger presence this time around, validating Nick Fury as a main staple in the MCU among the big boys. Captain America is stronger, faster, and a more refined soldier, equipped with better fighting skills and understanding of current technology. Evans plays the earnestness of Captain America's black and white morality with convincing finesse in an age of grey that he has yet to find a comfortable middle.

23,14 April 2021,Morejambo54,7," Unique, exciting and quite serious
","What I love most about this movie is the villain, which there isn't really one. This is what separates it from most average superhero movies. It takes a spin and says that a whole organisation of people are the villain, but even the characters in the movie don't know who is bad and who is good. It creates a very uneasy viewing as no one can be trusted as said and shown throughout. The opening scene on the boat is so very special. It instantly opens deliberately fast paced and gets the viewer on the edge of their seat. And just once they are completely focused on the action it takes a step back and allows an amazing and sophisticated story to be told. Unlike most other superhero movies, the plot of this one actually takes risks, it is far less predictable and has a less linear story. This does make some things get muddled up, but nothing that you really need to know to understand the film. As far as characters, they're alright. I don't expect incredible character arcs from a movie like this but I really enjoyed following Nick Fury, and also Steve and Bucky's relationship. I've heard major praise about the soundtrack, I thought it was a bit underwhelming, it doesn't really make a difference.

I still need to watch the first movie to actually figure out the whole ""Shield"" and ""Hydra"" thing and how it works and what Captain America has done.

","The winter soldier is one of the best sequels ever in cinema. Not only does it build upon its predecessor, but it expands on it so well it can hold its merit by itself. This movie discusses politics but in a subtle way. It shows how we approach politics in general. Like Captain America, it is our core individual beliefs that motivate us. This movie focuses on Captain America to the max. This is a character-focused film without giving anything much to the plot, but it manages to fit in the massive story it has. I have no issues with the film, and maybe the antagonists could've been more explained and fleshed out in the film. But it gives enough of what the movie needs.

64,5 April 2014,ironhorse_iv,8," O' Captain, My Captain. All Hail, the Captain! Captain America: Winter Soldier was pretty badass.
","From an optimistic WWII Pulp-inspired adventure movie to a morally ambiguous modern espionage thriller. While, Captain America: The Winter Soldier was indeed, a sequel to 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger, the movie is only somewhat similar to that. Rather than facing cookie cutter type evil villains like the Nazism Hydra. Captain America (Chris Evans) find himself, in a world where it's harder to find who the villains are, as everybody has a shade of grey becoming more and more disillusioned as members of S.H.I.E.L.D attacking him. Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, the movie deals with a 2002's Minority Report precognition type plot that somewhat mirrors a lot of the post-Watergate political fears of the government will create something that will preemptively eliminate any future threats to national security without fair trials or judgment. It's also is a metaphor for the actual surveillance crap done by the NSA & drones strikes that most Americans find disturbing. Another motif is the increasing security measures the United States government has done since 9/11. The movie also tend to want to bring up Hydra again into this, as I thought it didn't had to, as it kinda made the realistic political power structure more cartoony. The Hydra subplot is just as ridiculous as the real life belief of Illuminati taking over the government, but I guess it kinda make sense, as Operation Paperclip was indeed a real life event thing. Still, I doubt a bunch of Nazism are leading the country. I thought it would better suited for H.A.M.M.E.R or the Thunderbolts. Something new from the comics. Still, this movie truly respects the philosophy and moral aspect that Captain America as a character represents towards America's society. ""This isn't freedom. This is fear,"" -Captain America, he quotes about what's happening to the country. While, the movie is title, the Winter Soldier. Without spoiling who he is, he plays more like a henchman, than the leading villain. Adapted from the comic book, the origins of his past is way different here on the film as the movie blends elements from various sources and continuities. A good example of big change is key comic characters like Aleksander Lukin and Vasily Karpov are replaced. Still, the Winter Soldier isn't underplayed as he get a lot of scenes throughout the film. He is pretty awesome and match well to Captain America. Some of the hand to hand combat are just intense to watch. Most of the action scenes seem extremely realistic grounded and believable, even if it's bit over sci-fi and Captain America almost looks like God-like. I like how the action isn't all CGI orgy. The limit CGI in the film was used well in the last part of the film. The live action scenes get better with all the paranoia sub plot as you don't know, who is to be trusted and who isn't. Sadly, the movie is pretty predictable as who is the villains. The plot twists are not delivery correctly. I do find it, distracting that the movie makes up new or bring up new inventions on the spot, just for the villains or the heroes to escape. Too much deus ex machinas. Another thing, I dislike about the comic book movies is how often, they give us these 'fake' deaths, only to bring back the character later on the film, or in a sequel. If you going to kill a major character. People need to stay dead, or the film will lose a bit of sense of danger. There is a few shaky cam that hurt a little bit and some awful cuts. Another thing is while it's can be watch in 3D, there isn't much in the film that makes you want to. It's better off, if you watch the film in 2D. One last thing, there is a lot of nods to the first Captain film, 2012's Avengers, and even 2011's & 2013's Thor's movies as video clips, sight gags, or name references are throughout the film that pretty cool to see. It also felt like dumb recapping or exposition. Still, it was a bit odd to hear Dr. Strange. That would be interesting if he ever show up in a Marvel film. There are sight gags to other films like Pulp Fiction, Star Wars, War Games and others, worth watching out for. The acting in the film is pretty good. Falcon's (Anthony Mackie) presence is similarly unnecessary, but it's cool to have him around. He's pretty useful. Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) has nothing to do with his comic book counterpart, but he's just amazing. I love how Redford is hired for this film because of his work in previous political thrillers. I like how Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) opened up more in this movie. We got to see more of her vulnerable and human side, and her deeply hidden desire to connect with someone on a human level. A great female character for women. No, silly love story here. Still, how could she be a byproduct of the Cold War KGB if she was born 1983 and the Cold War ended in 1991? That doesn't make any sense. Also where is Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) in throughout the events of the film? I thought he was a top S.H.I.E.L.D agent and he doesn't shown up. Not even a cameo! Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) got a pretty good action sequence. Also looks out for other nameless cameos that you would play bigger parts in the next Captain America movie like Agent 13 (Emily VanCamp) & Brock Rumlow (Frank Grillo). Without spoiling the ending, it's bittersweet. The monochrome, symbolism-packed closing credits are reminiscent of the credits for a spy thriller such as one of the James Bond films. There is two after credits scenes worth noting. One is hinting 2015's Avengers: Age of Ulton. The other one is more closure. Also look for the Stan Lee Cameo. Overall: A wonderful thriller, conspiracy and adventure that delivers a great film",/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014

Constant non-stop action. Great characters with great dialogue. Smart rejoinders. The occasional shot of estrogen to mix it up. Honor the ""origins"" and integrate the plot arc from the earlier entry. Constant non-stop action. A ""staggered"" story that keeps presenting ever-greater challenges to the hero. Surprises. More estrogen. More non-stop action. More witty dialogue. Mix well and bake for about 2 hours. The end result is so good you almost wonder aloud why all the ""other"" superhero movies you have seen in your lifetime were not this good. Makes THE DARK KNIGHT look like an afternoon TV soap.

","With a much needed change in direction, endlessly fun action sequences, and the best acting Marvel has had to offer up until Infinity War- Captain America The Winter Soldier is a giant improvement upon its predecessor.

The plot of this film is a bit bloated at times- throwing information at you at rapid pace that it can be hard to keep up with everything as it goes on. The look of the film can also be a bit dull, mostly subtle grays and slightly grittier shots- but thankfully the film itself is able to pull it out of feeling the same way throughout. I loved the acting in this movie, all the stars really stepped it up a notch, including Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury- giving his best performance throughout the MCU so far. I'm glad they gave more depth into Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow- not forcibly sexualized like some films before it, and I truly enjoyed Chris Evans and Anthony Mackie's chemistry on screen- something that for two action stars is not always very easy to do. The action scenes are incredibly well done throughout, the Russo brothers truly live in the excitement of each shot, as if they are making it to enjoy themselves- and really it works so well. The film is decently entertaining, a bit bloated as I stated before, but it definitely keeps your interest for its nearly 2.5 hour long run.

After being frozen in ice for decades and helped formed The Avengers in the battle of New York, Chris Evans returns once again as Steve Rogers/Captain America that is still getting use to the new world around him and how to move forward. While he is doing that, he is also working with S. H. I. E. L. D. on a tactical team for top secret missions alongside Natasha Roman/Black Widow. After a rescue mission on a cargo ship goes a little awry, Nick Fury is being cornered by not only the worlds top leaders, but also Captain America on what is really going on behind S. H. I. E. L. D. While Fury is questioning himself what is going on behind closed doors at S. H. I. E. L. D., a deadly attack against not only Fury himself, but other colleagues of S. H. I. E. L. D. leaves Captain America and Black Widow on the run to discover the truth and uncover Hydra's plan with the Winter Soldier being one step ahead of them. With that being said, this movie manages to capture and make this film more solid than Captain America: The First Avenger. From the action, to the gunplay, to the stunts, this is a film that stands on its own and gives us one of the best storylines of the MCU while also introducing us to not only different sides of characters we haven't seen before, but new characters included. For starters, the standout character in this film is definitely Sebastian Stan's Bucky Barnes/ The Winter Soldier. The way he captures the trauma, abuse, and the psychotic side of the Winter Soldier was pulled off masterfully, making his villain in this movie one of my favorites ever in the MCU. Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce was a great casting choice as well as Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson/Falcon. Back to what I said before, I was glad to get to see a different side of characters particularly in Black Widow and Nick Fury. I was also glad we got to know a little more about Steve's and Bucky's friendship as they were growing up. Overall by the end, the film leaves you more than satisfied and makes you want more from it while giving you hope on what's to come in the future.

89,23 March 2014,abhishek-upadhayaya,9," Marvel makes a bold move!
","Marvel showed pretty clearly in Iron Man 3 that they are not afraid to take risk, bend comic stories and venture into unknown territories. I was pleasantly surprised by Captain America : The Winter Soldier because Marvel is able to do surprise audience like never before. This movie has mostly everything a fan could ask for. A political drama, conspiracy theories, Chris Evans portrayal of a ""out of his time"" superhero who is trying to blend in with the world and thinks that ""Internet is helpful"", typical Marvel's laugh out loud moments and above all some mesmerizing action sequences. Threat in this movie is not as big as the one in Thor :The Dark World since only our tiny planet is at stake rather than entire 9 realms with imaginative difficult to pronounce names, but thanks to some very smart blend of direction, acting and close to perfect background scores, threat seems to be much bigger and more importantly, real this time. You actually care for the fate of entire planet and characters. You do come face to face with the full potential of SHIELD and its structure, its influence on world politics and when the actual villain is revealed, you just cannot hide your excitement. SHIELD acts as a central character in the movie and shows itself to be far bigger and complex than what we suspected after watching all the Marvel offerings. There is Nick Fury as usual hiding secrets, keeping secrets and digging secrets but watching him vulnerable in this movie is much better than watching him acting all almighty in Avengers. Chris Evans shine in this role and I can imagine he won't be at the bottom of favorite Avengers list after this movie. His portrayal of Captain America is near perfect. Scarlett Johansson is a surprise package in the film portraying Black Widow character. She gets ample screen time presence this time, even in scenes where she is not kicking someone. It is actually the first time we learn something about Black Widow, duplicity in her character just adds tension to the already built suspense in the movie. Sebastian Stan is good in his portrayal of winter soldier. He is a perfect nemesis to Captain America in the movie. I bet you haven't seen such creative combat scenes between these two ever before. Action here is not as loud as Thor movies, it is more real, every bullet which find its target hurts, every punch delivered matters, it is so enjoyable to watch just because it is so real. I wish I could write about some more characters but that will be giving away some key points. Please be assured there are some great character comebacks, some you expected, some you didn't. I was a little let down by the climax of the film by its simplicity after the real motive of the real villain is revealed, but of course you have to remember its a Marvel film, there doesn't exist any situation alien/political/social which can't be solved by few explosions and kicks. Overall it's a highly entertaining film from Marvel, I will put it behind only Avengers and first Iron Man, this movie deserves your weekend. And of course it goes without saying, don't dare to leave your seats until last credits have rolled out, you have probably all heard the rumors about Joss Whedon directing the end credit scene. Yes it is awesome and offers an insight into the next Avengers movie.",/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014

","#MCUrewatch. Captain America: The Winter Soldier really feels as a game changer within the MCU. After the huge success of Avengers, the subsequent two films (Iron Man 3 and Thor 2) kinda felt repetitive. The MCU was already feeling predictable in the early stages of Phase 2. But then came Captain America 2 (and followed by an even better film; Guardians of the Galaxy). What makes Cap 2 great is first of all the great work of the Russo brothers as directors. No wonder they became the go to directors for Marvel. How they stage action sequences is fantastic (especially the Fury assassination and the tense elevator scene). The film feels more like a very strong action thriller than a superhero film. Secondly, the Russos managed to make the somehow dull Steve Rogers and interesting character. Sure, he's still no charmer such as Tony Stark but his dilemma (a man out of time, struggling with themes as trust and following orders) is worked out quite well in this film. The overall feeling of paranoia (great casting of 70's paranoia film icon Redford) is present and feels makes for an unnerving feeling. For me, this is the moment the MCU became more than a bunch of generic superhero films. Job well done!",/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014

",So another superhero movie. I was hoping it might be at least as good as the first if not better but alas this was really weak (just like Thor II). Some one needs to let movie directors know that action sequences (lots of sequences) do not make up for a really weak plot and exceptionally bad dialog. I agree with a lot of others that they should have developed Cap's story more. His time with his old girl was short and amounted to nothing but I guess they didn't know how not to make it too sad. You know that you're in trouble when the supporting characters are more interesting than your hero and all of your villains. Samuel L again rocks Nick Fury and we all know that Black Widow desires a movie of her own. I could have cared less about the Winter Soldier and poor Robert Redford was really out of place. Everyone should be glad that Shield folded because they really need to start over with some better guys. I hope the next one is a while cause I'm not looking forward to anymore action sequences.,/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014

103,28 March 2014,dreamtakers,10," Marvel Slays it Once Again! Bravo!!!
","I had a feeling that Captain America: Winter Soldier would be an amazing movie once the trailer was released. Turns out, I couldn't be more accurate. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is not the usual superhero movie, it underlies a dark theme of politics and conspiracy beneath it. Haunting pasts, betrayals and fake deaths all come into play. In this film, we get to see Steve Rogers' full potential in terms of his heroism and leadership. When the leader of S.H.E.I.L.D., Nick Fury, takes the fall, it is up to Steve Rogers to determine the fate of S.H.E.I.L.D and most importantly, the livelihood of mankind. As the stoic and fearless hero that he is, Rogers takes charge and enlists the help of Natasha Romanoff aka The Black Widow as well as a new sidekick, Sam Wilson aka Falcon, to defeat HYDRA. He exuberates skills that we have never seen before with his gravity defying flips, kicks and punches, even single handedly defeating a whole vessel of villains. It is also exciting to see the strong bond between Captain America, Black Widow and Falcon. The trios are as loyal as ever to one another, never once faltering despite near death scenarios and with multitude obstacles being hurled their way like a violent hurricane. They displayed excellent teamwork in the process of defeating the baddies. The movie also sheds some light and heart-warming moments as well. The playful and snarky banter between good friends Natasha and Steve is fun to watch. The escalator scene, anyone? Also, the scene between Steve and his former love, Peggy was priceless.

Captain America goes rogue when he is a suspect in the shooting of Nick Fury and has to unravel who has infiltrated S.H.E.I.L.D. Black Widow and Falcon help him out, and they are both made to be very resourceful on their own. I like Johansson here better than the Avengers--she seems to be putting more into the performance. I noticed that Captain America doesn't really use stealth in combat--when he fights, he goes through the threat in spite of what he's up against. There's a scene when a jet is trying to stop him while riding a motorcycle. Instead of jumping the bike to somewhere the jet can't follow, he engages and disables it. The Winter Soldier villain does this also, taking out Nick Fury in spite of his training, not going around any defenses. All the fights were lightning fast and had a level of interest to them where so many other action movies are full of scenes that never make us care.

But even with all the fan services Endgame (& other MCU movies) gave us along with big cgi battles in 4 Avengers movies and all the colorful Guardians movies + Ragnarok, Winter Soldier still is the best thing MCU delivered us. Rather than being a fun, colorful hero vs villain fight Winter Soldier gives us something else. It's suspenseful, it's thrilling, it's badass. The action scenes are so well done especially that Cap vs Bucky (that knife flip is too good). Also the elevator scene, Cap's monologue, Falcon, Black Widow, the first action sequence everything is just perfect. My favorite thing about this movie is that it starts the journey of badass Steve Rogers (before we get started, does anyone wanna....) instead of just a guy on steroids talking about patriotism.

The biggest problem with the film is that it has no rhythm. It has quiet talking-loud action syndrome with uninspired set pieces, unpolished effects, melodramatic dialogue and unconvincing fight scenes. It tries to have atmosphere but it feels more cobbled together than anything. Now I kind of like its idea, the idea that Captain America is unfamiliar and anxious about the surveillance of our modern world, but it feels blown out of proportion in a way that's illogical and needlessly convoluted. It can be mildly entertaining at times with witty one liners and clever action (Scarlett Johansson excluded) but its biggest crime is it drags. It makes me wonder if kids really enjoy this.

The cinematography and visual effects are breathtaking, and you are completely unable to distinguish what's a physical set and what is CGI. The casting, once again, is perfect. The villains are the best the MCU has offered to this point, beating their competition easily. The fake-out with Samuel L. Jackson's character was done perfectly, as well as the reveal that Sebastian Stans character had been saved in Captain America: The First Avenger. This film is easily the best in the MCU to date. My only complaint would be to the fact that I find it strange that no one would have contacted Iron Man or anyone one else in the Avengers for assistance, especially with the stakes so high.

","My title might sound ambiguous as to whether I enjoyed this film or not well let me assure you that I did. I have such a great amount of respect for Marvel/Disney and what they've done with this Superhero Universe. It is so diverse and instead of bottoming out with each film they release they seem to continue to set the bar and open up new avenues in this world. Captain America: Winter Soldier serves to do exactly that...add layers and layers to the Avengers world. This is both its success and its curse. At times Captain America: Winter Soldier feels like an epilogue unlike Thor 2 which stood firmly on its own two feet. It does attempt to create its own story while making sure to fast track the Avengers storyline but even the main story is really just more for The Avengers to cover in Age of Ultron. This isn't a bad thing, it just means that Captain America: Winter Soldier doesn't stand out very well on its own. There is a myriad of terrific action scenes, apparently done with minimal CGI and I LOVE that!! The hand to hand combat scenes are plentiful and really well choreographed. Then there is a ton of story development, thrills and twists and turns (some are a little obvious I think) but the comparisons to the spy/thriller genre are apparent. This, again, is both its curse and success. Sometimes it felt like it dragged just a little bit and when you go into Captain America you aren't necessarily prepared to see a thriller with a lot of story. Its all very well done, please don't get me wrong, it just is a little off-putting after seeing the non-stop thrill ride that was Thor 2.",/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014

There are so many twists and turns and to quote Rotten Tomato critics it's ""politically astute"". Awesome, awesome movie. Captain America is now my top favourite Avenger alongside Black Widow.
It's quite brutal and violent, but not overly graphic. It's themes are entertaining and the emotions hit hard, which along earns this movie a high rating.

All this provide Captain America a distinct identity in Marvel Cinematic Universe. To balance the fun, beautiful Scarlett Johnson playing agent Natasha, her boss Nick Fury played enjoyably by Samuel L. Jackson and loyal sidekick to captain played by charming Anthony Mackie provide enough jokes. To complete the story, we have a ruthless mercenary The Winter Soldier who is amazing with the mask but surprisingly average without the mask. Movie takes its own sweet time before starting the action in full blow when Nick Fury is attacked by the evils. Action scenes are full of well edited man to man fights and climax is overblown much in the lines of The Avengers. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Captain America: The Winter Soldier.

","Captain America: The Winter Soldier, a cinematic spectacle that had me cheering for justice and questioning loyalties like a Marvel maestro.

","Straight off the Marvel assembly line, Captain America: Winter Soldier has a convoluted plot about S.H.I.E.L.D being compromised and a mysterious villainous soldier who has a link to Rogers' past. A half assed attempt at subversive material about surveillance, is a couple of throwaway lines of dialogue. A sequence showing a Captain America exhibit at a museum, is a poor expository recap of parts of the first film and why Rogers would show up to an exhibit of himself so he can be reminded of his own past is forced and silly. Who needs memories when you have a narrator and museum artifacts to remind yourself what your purpose is. The new addition to this material is Anthony Mackie who is forced into this story like a jagged puzzle piece. In typical Marvel fashion, the third act is generic action that takes over the narrative. Very little of it is exciting or practically staged - it's mostly animation and feels pre-visualized by committee filmmaking and has no real vision. A soul deadening scene at an Apple store add to the assembly line feel.

","A movie that is well paced, enjoyable and full of talent. The director and production staff reached into that big Marvel 'bag-of-tricks,' and voilà. This flick has good guys overcoming insurmountable oddsat-the-very-last minute; bad guys turning into good guysat-the-very-last minute; good guys coming to the rescue at-the-very-last minute; the world being saved at-the-very-last minute and – last but not least – Samuel L. Jackson brought back from the dead – YES – at-the-very-last minute. It all sounds like a formula designed for comic book successgood whoops bad – all in the nick-of-time. What spectacular plot-candy and all these are complements of Marvel Comics. I know there are those out there who prefer the more dismal, and almost macabre superheroes, which are churned out by, 'those other guys' – I like them too. They are a very different breed, they almost paint themselves as victims or societal outcasts – well cry me a river. I don't care if the other guys churn out more thoughtful superheroes – they are comic book characters toolighten up. Besides, you make too deep of a character, you may find acting is required. Meh – acting is over-rated. Who needs acting? Come on, this is a story from a comic bookabout comic book characters. Now don't get me wrong, there is good acting in the movie. Samuel L. Jackson IS Nick Fury, no denying that and it was time for him to get a bigger part. Now Robert Redford, as THE villain - that was a bit of a surprise. He played his part so convincingly. Alexander Pierce's collectivist crimson hue fit Mr. Redford so well the studio probably had him believing his character WAS the hero. Scarlett Johansson looked comfortable in spandex and did a fine job kicking and punching and shooting all those nasty evildoers. OH – and I really like Anthony Mackie as, 'Falcon.' The guy is a great actor, but I must admit that I can't help that every time I look at his face, I weep a little and want to yell, 'We Are Falcon!' Anyways – go see this movie.

","If I had to use one word to describe this movie it would be thrilling: it just keeps going on a on without ever slowing down and it is constantly involving, I was genuinely on th edge of my seat for most of the movie. All the cast is doing a great job: highlights apart form Chris Evans for me would be Scarlett Joansson and Sebasian Stan, giving a great presence by using just the eyes. The set-pieces are breathtaking and they are used for great action scenes which always carry on the storytelling with them, never did they feel useless. The story is very intricated yet it never confuses you or takes you out of it, but there is some great stuff left there for multiple viewings that I loved. Special effects are flawless as always from Marvel Studios and the character design for the winter soldier was wonderful. I do think that the first action sequence is very messy and has some poor cinematography, all around the first five to ten minutes of the movie didn't feel like the best opening but anyways it picked up quickly after. I do think the story takes a couple of minor shortcuts that bothered me, but in the end the plot was very well thought out and the storytelling was most definitely successful. I will have to see this movie another one or two times to fully enjoy it and I mean that in a positive way. As comic book geek I cannot thanks Marvel enough for all of the fan service there was in this movie, these are the things that make me happily freak out and that make comic book movies great for me.

The plot was way superior to the other Marvel movies, the acting was great, and there were some amazing action scenes. I don't want to get into spoilers about the plot of this film, so I won't, but what they did, being able to tie two movies together when one takes place in 1945, and the other takes place in 2014 was some of the best writing I have ever seen. The acting as usual was great, I was particularly fond of Sebastian Stan's acting in this movie. It was unbelievable. I think I read somewhere he only had 8 lines the entire movie, he was able to express the emotion and some of the reason as to why Bucky is the Winter Soldier, with only 8 lines. I am shocked he didn't get nominated for an Oscar.

Still, in a misguided attempt to keep up with popular ""culture"", I endured this shoot-em-up to the end. Here's my take... While the main character has his moments and was actually almost convincing in his deadpan sincerity, the Black Widow girl seemed silly, with no subtlety at all - her facetious lines were bad instruments of girl power and didn't come across at all with almost no reaction from the audience. The super-bad guy has already been done in a recent Batman movie and came across as a very poor copy of Darth Vader (without any presence or enjoyable lines). Redford was completely miscast - Robert de Niro or Viggo Mortensen (although I bet they would have turned the dismal part down), or hell, Martin Short could have done a better job! Instead of an interesting, hopefully novel plot line, once again, the Writers/Director chose to moralize (in a hackneyed way) and expend unlimited ordnance; do the exploding/flying cars thing yet again. To top it off, there were stupid flying vessels and helicopter hijinx. None of the CG flying machines are as much fun as in 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow'.

","I can't understand the lack of imagination in so many comic book movies. While this movie is put together well, and the acting is great, it lacks the vision and humanness that compelled the actual comic books to be so enjoyable. Kids and teens read comic books because they speak universal, mythological truths' in the language of unconscious energies. This is also known as religion. Deep down everyone understands powerlessness, inferiority and immortality within the framework of one's personal history, time period and culture. Given we grow up in families, these issues are all the more important to kids and teens, especially issues of power and growing pains inherent in the developmental stages. Captain America personifies the sensitive and vulnerable person who is transformed into a superhero with superhuman abilities in the blink of an eye. Add patriotism and unquestionable evil (Hitler and Nazism) and the formula for a great character is born. He represents the fears and potentials we all hope for but cannot achieve due to our animal, mortal nature. One reason why Star Wars was so successful was because it understood that myths are alive and well in the modern age (though obscured by Rationalism and Science) and it transferred this psychological need onto celluloid. Movies are no different than superstitions; we just don't believe them as such. But they are still private dreams in the public domain, and because of this it feels dishonest and mindlessly inauthentic to gloss this value over with endless CGI action, lack of depth, and most of all characters who are so one dimensional and simplistic they could not have come from anywhere but a derivative formula. A convenient villain with a metal arm forged in the same time crucible as Steve Rogers who looks like one of the werewolves (in human form) from Twilight and is so totally devoid of imagination the viewer is easily distracted by the most mundane of distractions. How about this for a villain: Deep in the depths of lunatic asylum, festering and wasting away in a cell of powerful medications and medical experiments, the villain one day begins to hoard his meds and slowly remember who he is and where he is from—a Nazi experiment that used the same technology as that which was used on Rogers. And instead of a lame metal arm, when he is consumed with hatred and revenge his superpowers become more powerful, more diabolical and more fascinating whatever they may be.

Robert Redford was very miscast in this mess of a movie. They didn't let the winter soldier have enough screen time and they certainly didn't ask for that. What happened is that the Winter Soldier was never fully explained and he never really spoke. He said a line or two in what sounded like Russian and then a few other lines. I was very disappointed in Samuel L Jackson's lackluster performance as Nick Fury. He was also very irritating when they brought out the character he once played in that movie called Pulp Fiction. Did this movie have a beginning, middle and end? I would not call the END a true ending. Also, I am getting sick and tired of Stan Lee's cameos.

","Of all the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films – ie, any that relate to The Avengers – the first Captain America is my least favourite. In fact, I think it's a very ordinary movie that can't even match the other subpar MCU entry, The Incredible Hulk. This follow-up however, now set in present day rather than during WWII, is extremely well executed and enormously enjoyable. Taking Joe Johnston's place behind the camera, the Russo brothers inject the action with a ferocity lacking in Cap 1 and deliver on numerous set pieces both big and small; a slick and stealthy raid on a ship kicks things off, whilst a gigantic battle on, in, over, around and through a trio of heli-carriers offers a breathtaking denouement. The screenplay and characters are also better served in round 2. The plot throws more curveballs than any other MCU instalment and, tantalisingly, directly influences and shapes the path of the upcoming Avengers sequel. At the same time, the eponymous hero, who in previous outings has been righteous and morally steadfast to the point of boredom, is given room to evolve from boy scout symbol of all that is right in America, to a more charismatic, but no less incorruptible, defender of liberties that has his own shades of grey to contend with. Chris Evans has worked his way into the role wonderfully over three movies and now embodies Steve Rogers with ease, although he arguably loses the limelight to Scarlett Johannson who turns in her best Black Widow performance to date. Either way, the repartee shared between the two is electric and almost rivals Thor / Loki in the witty back-and-forth dialogue department. Anthony Mackie is likable as Cap's new pal Sam (alter ego Falcon), Frank Grillo is solid as hard arse special ops leader Brock Rumlow and Sebastian Stan's indefatigable assassin the Winter Soldier is a superb matchup for our super soldier hero. This blockbuster is not without its faults though; there are occasional narrative contrivances to deal with, a rather silly exposition scene at the midway point involving an underground computer hub, a wasted Robert Redford as SHIELD executive Alexander Pierce and the franchise-wide plot issue concerning the whereabouts of other Avengers during these times of woe.

Such was the case in the early 20th century when Smedly Butler walked out of the US army in disgust when he realised that what he was not frighting for was the freedom of oppressed people, but rather the interests of the corporate elite, when he realised that he was overthrowing legitimate governments in favour of business friendly tyrants who exist only to enrich the shareholders.

This would be to abandon freedom so anyone that might be a detriment to Hydra's plans is targeted for extermination. It will be up to Captain America (Chris Evans, who has made this character his own; this character will define his career for the most part) and former KGB officer, current S.H.I.E.L.D member (that was until Fury was attacked), Natasha Romanoff, the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson, with red hair and toned, athletic body) to stop Hydra. Joining them is former soldier, Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackle), going by Falcon because he has a special device in his backpack that unfolds metallic wings that allow him to fly. Assisting Hydra besides an equipped strike force called S.T.R.I.K.E is a former buddy of Captain's named Bucky (Sebastian Stan), captured by the Germans and built into a supersoldier called The Winter Soldier. With an arsenal of hi-tech weapons (including a computerized metallic arm akin to Captain's shield, explosives, and guns), impressive strength (he is one that can go man to man with Captain America), and fighting prowess (when Captain and the Winter Soldier do battle, neither can get an edge over the other), The Winter Soldier is quite a threat; he's the perfect solution to the pesky Captain America. Within S.H.I.E.L.D, Fury thought he had an ally in Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford; this role a direct departure for the actor), who is a high ranking member within the organization, but is wrong.Pierce is Hydra and believes the solution is to coral the human race into rule.

Iron Man 3 was good, but relied a lot more on comedy and felt at times separate from the rest of the Marvel universe. Thor delved a bit more into Asgard, but something about it seemed somewhat low budget. Captain America, though, felt like part of the larger Marvel universe as it dropped names, had multiple characters other than Cap and had the best villains in the Winter Soldier and an organization long thought defeated.

Jackson: Superior sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger. The heart of this action adventure evolves around grief at its most extreme. The Winter Soldier is a solid villain, played by Sebastian Stan and he is discovered to be Captain America's soldier friend who he presumed was dead in the previous film. His body was kept alive and corrupted into a super villain with an iron arm. Chris Evans returns as Captain America and he leads a charge to rescue aboard a ship where pirates have taken over. Scarlett Johansson reprises her role as Black Widow and Captain America questions her when he catches her extracting information about S.H.I.E.L.D. Captain America questions Nick Fury, who arranged the mission, on honesty, and he responds indicating that S.H.I.E.L.D has been compromised. Fury is soon ambushed in traffic and is presumed dead, and Captain America is on the run with information that regards an organization called Hydra. Anthony Mackie is added to the cast as Falcon. He is a sidekick to Captain America whose hero gimmick sprouts wings and a jet pack. Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury ends up a target and presumed dead when he summons Captain America. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo manage to upgrade from the previous film with an ending that opens for more possibilities.

","When I first saw the first Captain America movie on DVD, I thought it was OK, slightly boring with the over-the-top Hugo Weaving as Hydra and the mad scientist. Only the last scene had me in tears. So when I said I wanted to watch this movie, many of my friends said it was quite boring, comparing it to Man of Steel. But I was glad that I watched it, because I think it's comparable to Avengers! First of all, the acting. All the good guys can act, Samuel L Jackson (How can he even emote with 1 eye? Marvelous), Sam, Chris Evans, Agent Hill etc. I liked how that the women were given more prominent roles, with Black Widow being the brains of the operation. Although she did have to be romantic with Steve and keep on talking about dates. Luckily, Steve kind of rejected that. He is just the type to love one woman forever! I think that kind of devotion is really the norm back in the 40s, and that is so rare, nowadays movies have a lot of kisses and hugs, more doesn't mean that it is meaningful. Another thing I really like about the movie is how Steve showed us to be true to ourselves. Just because he is a soldier doesn't mean he had to follow orders. It's what we do that matters, not who we are. Lastly, I am so shipping Captain America and Winter Soldier. Well, at the end Steve face a dilemma, whether to kill his friend or be killed. If it were me, I think I'd just save myself. But that is not his style. He just has so much faith in everyone that it just blows me away. He values teamwork and is a really transformational leader. Talking about the movie, it was really funny and the action scenes were great.

The new characters they brought in were fantastic, the Falcon I especially enjoyed, his character was cool, comedic, and just an enjoyable person to watch; Robert Redford's political character was also on top form although the characters' traits and ambitions I have seen in other movies. Now talking of characters, the movie's subtitle the Winter Soldier was a fantastic, unique character who's life was deep and interesting to watch, the majority may know of his true identity already as Marvel haven't really done anything to cover it up as it is obvious from about 5 mins of casting research, but I felt the character wasn't used as much as I thought; his name is in the title but his story isn't the main arc, he was in less scenes than I expected. Another disappointer for me was that the climax seemed to have a lot more violence than previous ones, not as graphic as Thor: TDW, but certainly quite strong, almost distracting - although that may have been the cinema experience.

","Action wise, this is a good movie, but the problems start here when you have e.g. three heli carriers going down directly in the city or exactly where they lifted of, respectively. Or the very unbelievable falcon. On the other side, you have ordinary gunfights, so this is quite far stretched. Then we have the story around Hydra, which is completely implausible, added by Caps old friend Bucky. Btw, the title of the movie ""The Winter Soldier"" is quite misleading, cause he is only a quite minor part of the story. So, regarding this, you get the usual Hollywood big style action and effects show, but way, way exaggerated, and a quite lame story. The interesting thing may be the underlying message, if there is really one. By this, I mean the fact that the whole Shield structure was undermined and by this doing the exact opposite of what if was intended to. If this is so, there could be hidden critics to US policy, but I wouldn't call this for sure. If so, Cap would have to fight the system itself in the next part. That would be something! Taken this aside, good, but predictable standard Hollywood action. Nothing to get too excited about. Which is sad, because in this Captain America incarnation Evans got better, the transition to the modern world worked out, the combination with Captain America has a lot of potential and you start to develop a relation to Cap because he is (almost) on his own, has to fight the odds and doesn't feel like a invincible guy, you can see that he is ""enhanced"", but still human. Especially the fight in the elevator is great and good old style action. Instead they focus again on high tech and simply go to far with all this heli carrier, falcon and ""kill them all"" thing.

Heading to meet with agent Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders), Fury is ambushed by enemies, led by the mysterious masked assassin the Winter Soldier (Gone's Sebastian Stan), he survives the attack and makes it to Steve's apartment, Furty warns him that S.H.I.E.L.D. has been compromised and hands him a flash drive, before being shot and dying in surgery, Hill takes the body. Steve is summoned to the Triskelion, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s headquarters, to tell what he knows to official Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford), but refusing to say anything he is regarded a fugitive, but he escapes as the agency hunt for him, he and Romanoff join forces and in New Jersey locate a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. bunker where they can access the content of the flash drive. They activate a supercomputer with the preserved consciousness of Dr. Arnim Zola (Toby Jones), Zola explains that S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded after the Second World War, but since then enemy organisation HYDRA has secretly operated within its ranks, causing global chaos in the hope that humanity will surrender freedom for the security, and then the pair inside the bunker narrowly escape a missile attack on them. Steve and Romanoff recruit former USAF para-rescue man Sam Wilson aka Falcon (The Adjustment Bureau's Anthony Mackie) to join them, and they deduce the HYDRA mole inside S.H.I.E.L.D. is Jasper Sitwell (Maximiliano Hernández) who they catch and force to divulge the information he knows, that HYDRA has identified through data searching every single individual on the globe who is a threat to their plans, and the three satellites could be programmed to eliminate them all. Travelling to headquarters the trio are ambushed by the Winter Soldier and his assailants, during the long fight the assassin's masked is removed, Steve recognises him as his former comrade James Buchanan 'Bucky' Barnes, who he thought was dead, Hill then rescues the heroes and takes them to a safe house, where they find Fury is alive, he faked his death and he has plans to replace the programming chips for the satellites so they will not fire. At the Triskelion the World Security Council are gathered, Captain America exposes the plot by HYDRA, disguised Romanoff reveals herself and forces Pierce to leak out all classified information, Fury comes in eventually and after a struggle kills Pierce, meanwhile Rogers and Wilson work to try and change the controllers, but with the Falcon suit damaged Rogers is forced to do it alone, the Winter Soldier tries to stop him but the attack is stopped just in time for Hill to take control and have the vessels destroy each other. Wilson fights and defeats double agent Brock Rumlow (The Grey's Frank Grillo), while the Winter Soldier rescues Rogers when the vessels crash to the ground, but he disappears after this, in the end Fury using the cover of his apparent death heads to find the remaining HYDRA cells in Eastern Europe, Romanoff provides Rogers and Wilson information for them to track down the Winter Soldier program. Also starring Emily VanCamp as Kate aka Agent 13, Georges St- Pierre as Georges Batroc aka Batroc the Leaper, Jenny Agutter as Councilwoman Hawley, Garry Shandling as Senator Stern, Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, Alan Dale as World Security Council Member, Callan Mulvey as Jack Rollins, Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark, Stan Lee as Smithsonian Security Guard, Gary Sinise as The Smithsonian Narrator, Silent House's Elizabeth Olsen (Mary-Kate and Ashley's sister) as Wanda Maximoff and Kick-Ass's Aaron Taylor- Johnson as Pietro Maximoff. Evans is still straightforward and definitely growing into the role as he becomes more determined, Johansson is terrific being equally determined and a little feisty, Jackson gets much more time on screen as the smart leader, and even though a little stiff Redford is a villain. You don't have to necessarily pay attention to all the dialogue, the story once you settle into it is well thought out, using the contemporary surveillance scandals to good effect for the usual world destruction concept, of course the best bits are the explosive chase sequences and special effects bundled fight and battle sequences which are fantastic, as a sequel it definitely outweighs the original, a most entertaining action adventure.

","Forget the lingering cold weather and winter skies. The summer has officially arrived with CA:TWS! The first movie was a hit-and-miss affair that really served as a place holder until the Avengers. The Winter Soldier far exceeds the original in every way, showing how a recently-unfrozen 90-year-old reacts to the technology and politics of the 2000s. True, I am undeniably biased and utterly impressed with the cinematic universe Marvel has created. Still, with Iron Man and The Avengers, this is one of the better Marvel Universe films, one with gigantic implications for the entire franchise. It takes place a couple years after The Avengers, with Steve Rogers trying to find his place within SHIELD and modern America. But a new mysterious villain, Winter Soldier, is taking down everyone close to him. It plays on the 70s espionage thriller genre with verve and nostalgia, with the stakes always high and always felt. It asks big questions like, which matters more to us: our freedom or our safety? As this blast of intrigue and mystery begins to unfold, our yearning for fantastic action and hand-to-hand combat is fully fulfilled in what may be the most action-packed Marvel movie yet. Johansson and Jackson both play their roles as strongly as ever, but what truly makes Captain America work is Evans. He doesn't play Cap like Superman, but instead injects vulnerability and naiveté into the superhero. He's taken seriously. This leads to a bit of corny nostalgia and some moments of slight boredom, but overall CA:TWS is an action packed blast that is a must for any fan of the Marvel universe.",/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014

It was a bit long and it did lack some wit, like the Iron Man movies, but it's got loads of intense drama and action throughout. Compared to the other super heroes, I don't find Captain America to be the most entertaining because he hasn't really got any super powers like Superman or the Hulk. Anyway, the film is a great watch and the performances from the actors were quite good. I was expecting some references to the other Avengers at some point, but the director chose to focus on Evans character. Some of the lines and scenes were slightly corny but it's what you expect from an American hero who is completely devoted to the saviour of his country. In all, it's a great addition to the Captain America franchise, but I preferred the mixture of characters in the Avengers.

This could have easily been a Tom Clancy novel that had Captain America written into it. The story has many brilliant twists. The action scenes are spectacular. The visual effects are close to perfect. You name it, and the movie nails it - acting, directing, music. Chris Evans is at his best in the lead role.

In The Winter Soldier, Steve Rodgers is trying to adjust to the modern world until a conspiracy involving SHIELD comes to light, but Cap also has to team up with Black Widow to battle another threat: The Winter Soldier. To me, Captain America has always been the most interesting Avenger because of how he was forced to leave behind his old life and friends, especially his old lover Peggy Carter, and adjust to life in the 21st century. It allows him to be more than just a roided-up superhero with a cool shield, and his struggle with readjustment is explored well in this movie. He also has to deal with a myriad of other significant issues like SHIELD and the Winter Soldier. The political conspiracy plot in particular adds a lot of suspense and twists to the story to make it consistently thrilling while the Winter Soldier provides a lot of great action sequences. His character is mysterious throughout the film, and he's definitely one of the better Marvel movie villains. Captain America: The Winter Soldier should certainly please even the most casual comic book movie viewer with its intense action, great plot and witty writing.

","It's only April and already this gets my vote for worst film of the year. The first scene is utterly cringe-worthy. Chris Evans and Anthony Mackie (like a young Will Smith) buddy up whilst jogging round a park in Washington DC. It's stilted and humourless. Chris Evans doesn't wear a mask all the time but he might as well for all the expression he puts into things. The film then elevates Samuel L. Jackson (with eye-patch) to centre-stage to good, adrenalin-fuelled effect but immediately kills him off as soon as he gets our sympathy. Robert Redford emerges a few seconds later, to fill the Alpha Daddy void, without hitherto being mentioned. His job is to pump up the film's credibility but the political plot stinks. I walked out the theatre at this point. What makes me most sad is that I really liked the first Captain America film, which is the reason I made the effort to see this one as soon as it came to town. I guess it must have been the interest of the 1950s setting which made it for me, as this sequel completely alienated me. Perhaps also, Chris Evans fitted the role as a squeaky-clean postwar guy.

395,19 April 2014,toqtaqiya2,8," A superior sequel that, at the very least, stands shoulder-to-shoulder with its whizbang predecessor.
","The Winter Soldier is another solid entry in Phase Two of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's just as good and, in my opinion, even better than The First Avenger (2011). It's become the norm now that Marvel Studios films are some of the most anticipated blockbusters of the year. All of them have been good. Some people who've seen the film in the theaters have said that The Winter Soldier is the best of the bunch. I think that The Avengers (2012) remains the best Marvel film so far, though The Winter Soldier comes close. One often remembers the exciting action scenes when praising this film. There's a number of action scenes, and all of them are quite memorable. The neat thing about them is that they're as realistic as possible. In my view the film is simply a technological thriller that's meant to be both modern and realistic. Directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo gave this sequel a hi-tech sheen that's different from the steampunk visual approach of Joe Johnston for The First Avenger. The realism is largely due to Captain America himself and his comic book stories. He doesn't possess spectacular powers like the other avengers, so screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely constructed a plot that rotates around politics and characters. Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow has her biggest role yet in this film and so does Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury. Actually, the entire film is about S.H.I.E.L.D. and what happens to it. Chris Evans' Steve Rogers plays an important part in what's going on, but it's still only a part. When it comes to Rogers it's mostly the continuation of his adjustment to the modern world. This, however, isn't really interesting because there's not much to it. It is the focus of the film's humor however. Unlike Iron Man 3 (2013) and Thor: The Dark World (2013), The Winter Soldier contains little comedy. It suffers as a result because the political intrigue is, for the most part, not that interesting (at least for me) for a summer blockbuster. Still, thanks to Robert Redford playing the part of Alexander Pierce, this is made bearable. Rogers goes through a believable struggle in the course of the film, and Evans manages to appear vulnerable despite Rogers' strength and skills. The introductions of Sebastian Stan as Winter Soldier and Anthony Mackie as Falcon are exciting bits that reinforce the film's themes of trust and friendship. Guardians Of The Galaxy (2014) and Avengers: Age Of Ultron (2015) will follow The Winter Soldier, yet it already feels like plenty has happened in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This film is a fairly impressive feat. I can argue that the action and the characterization can be improved, but it's still a smart balance of story and action. Like the big majority of blockbusters of recent years it follows the movie formula of Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). I also noticed parts of it that are influenced by Come And See (1985), which is one of my favorite films. The Winter Soldier already earned a lot of money at the box office. I'd recommend it but you've probably already seen it.",/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014

439,5 April 2014,WheelzFourReelz,9," Iron Man 3 and Thor The Dark World should start taking notes.
","The Phase 2 Marvel Avengers tie-in movies have been kind of under a dry spell. Sure, Iron Man 3 and Thor the Dark World were entertaining, but they were no where near capturing the essence of the Marvel movies like The Avengers and before did. However, if there was any movie to bring light into this phase 2 of Marvel movies, it would be Captain America the Winter Soldier. Ever since the first trailer came out for this, there was lots of promise. So the question is, was that promise fulfilled? In this movie, Steve Rogers is still getting used to the new world after being frozen and whatnot. He has been taken up by SHIELD to do missions. During a mission, he discovers a secret behind SHIELD that could put everyone's lives in jeopardy. So Captain America, along with Black Widow, has to discover this secret and put a stop to what's going on. And even encounter the Winter Soldier. I loved the plot for this movie. It was well written and it certainly got me engrossed into the movie. One of the things that made the story shine was how it developed the characters. It made you really care about them and in some cases, fear for them. The acting in this movie is well done. Chris Evans does an awesome job as Captain America and I can't picture anyone who could play him better. Sam Jackson was a great Nick Fury, Anthony Mackie was a great Falcon, Sebastian Stan was a great Winter Soldier, and Scarlett Johansson was a great Black Widow. It's also just fun to look at Scarlett Johansson so yeah. The action in this movie is some of the best I've ever seen. It contains action that looks real, brutal, and gritty. You feel every hit that's blown. The action's exciting and certainly made me giggle with excitement. And yes, guys can giggle. Despite all of this, I have a couple minor, nit-picky complaints. First is that I feel there are a couple scenes that feel out of place. The movie as a whole is pretty consistent with its necessary scenes, but there are a couple parts in the movie that seem out of place. (SPOILER WARNING!) One of them is the scene where Captain America meets with the girlfriend he left behind back in the 40s. It is a nice scene in its own right, but it feels out of place because nothing like this happens for the rest of the movie (SPOILER OVER!). This doesn't happen a lot, though. There's probably about three of these out of place points. I also wish that the Winter Soldier was in this movie more. The Winter Soldier is an absolutely awesome character and he certainly is a menace. However, I think that he wasn't in the movie quite enough for this movie to be called ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"". Maybe about ten more minutes of screen time would be perfect. Overall, Captain America: The Winter Soldier was fun, exciting, intense, and funny without the humor completely overshadowing the material. This is certainly one of the best Avengers tie-in movies. Yes, The Avengers movie itself is still my favorite in the series, but it's a close call between Iron Man and this. This is, without a doubt, my favorite movie of the year and you absolutely need to see it. And don't leave before the credits. Just saying.",/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014

In this installment Captain America is caught in the middle of a conspiracy involving S.H.I.E.L.D and a mysterious figure named the Winter Soldier. Now I think this is the best movie in the MCU that I believe is the Dark Knight of the MCU franchise. What makes this film surpass the other MCU movies is that the Russo Brothers decided to take espionage films like Three Days of the Condor and All the Presidents Men and make it their own Marvel movie. They even got Robert Redford who is the star of Three Days of the Condor and All the Presidents Men to star in this. This movie smells of 100% pure confidence as every department involved in making this went with gut instinct to create something beautiful. It's also not afraid to take any risks either as it just does and takes whatever it feels like without any consequences. It's so brilliant that it makes me want to pick up a comic book that involves Hydra, S.H.I.E.L.D, Armin Zola, to just about anything I can think of.

There are repeated combat/action sequences, involving both astounding physical and firearms feats, which are engaging as well as memorable. There are a few plot twists, some more telegraphed than others, but all acceptable; except for one incident that was taken from 'The Avengers' and 'Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.' series, which felt cheap and used. The biggest issue that I had was that very few conflicts were actually solved, while a plentiful bounty were presented. If you're after closure, Captain America ""2"" is not for you. On the other hand, if you were a fan of 'Lost's' seemingly endless array of revealed, yet abandoned situations, you might feel right at home here.

","Well, despite how ""average"" the first one was, I went to see the second. And oh boy I am glad I did (you can already tell this is a positive review). More to the point, the film is one of, if not the strongest individual Marvel installments to date. One part spy thriller, one part character journey, one part action movie, and one part straight-up superhero adventure film, The Winter Soldier hits all of the right notes and serves as an example of the very best of what comic book movies have to offer. I was extremely surprised at how much I enjoyed the film in the first place. The beginning of the movie is a sort of message from the directors, ""Welcome Back to the Marvel Universe"". In The Avengers, Captain America acted like just a normal soldier who can jump high and punch hard but in The Winter Soldier, his powers really do shine. His superhuman strength and agility is shown perfectly, like the comics, and this is one of the main improvements from the first film and The Avengers. Captain America: The Winter Soldier benefits from a great story, solid actors, realistic CGI, action and also a mysterious, haunting villain, The Winter Soldier. Character isn't sacrificed for the sake of plot, though. The Winter Soldier is a well-balanced film that involves comedy, drama, and action. The big and small moments are equally thick with tension and there is some powerful development in this film. In fact, Chris Evans' Steve Rogers / Captain America in some ways becomes the most relatable of the Marvel heroes in this film, which is, of course, a bit odd, given his origin.",/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014

",I will admit when watching the followup to 2011 film I liked how it showed Steve Rogers dealing with the modern world and continuing to help others. When Steve's old friend Bucky Barnes as the winter solider who has been brainwashed by hydra into being a assassin it makes Steve question the morality of shield and its ethics. In terms of the newcomers I would say that Anthony mackie is fantastic as Sam Wilson aka the falcon who is an important ally to Steve Rogers. I do wish that Emily van camp would have been given more to do as Sharon carter ask agent 13 but hopefully her role will be bigger in the third film. I would say that Robert Redford as Alexander pierce is a rather interesting addition to the role since there is a sense of mystery to his character. I will say that the events of this film will be a set up for the avengers sequel age of ultron.

478,6 April 2014,thevinodraman,9," Perfect Sequel and a bridge for Avengers : Age Of Ultron
","Captain America - The Winter Soldier Review I missed out watching the First Avenger in theater when it got released. Well, Captain America will always remain as an the sanest/sensible one among all the other heroes of the Marvel Universe in the Avenger Lineup. The promos of the movie already gave the viewers a peek over the neck and neck dual between the Winter Soldier and the Cap. Now for the movie, it carries a good pace with itself and the story-line brings the gap closer to Avengers : Age of the Ultron. Chris Evans as Cap Am, gained some extra pounds and is well toned to look more huge, especially in 3D . Chris Evans have come a long way from playing a goofy Pyro in Fantastic Four. Good to see him back donning the American Colors. His action execution has improved, thanks to the wonderfully choreographed stunts and possible competition from Seb Stan. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow continues her role with a mysterious past and an aging future. She looks terribly old in certain parts of the movie. In other areas, she performs her stunts with ease and shares a good rapport with Cap Am. Anthony Mackie as Falcon, in his debut ""superhero"" movie dons the Stark Industries powered Wings and assists them in the final stages of the movie. I personally think he deserved some more fire power as he looks a bit vulnerable in that part. Tony... Could you help him with that ? Sam J as Nick Fury. There is nothing to describe his character. We all know how Sam J takes any role and how easily he fits into a character like Nick Fury. Robert Redford as Pierce. Good to see Redford back again in the universe. Even if it was only for one movie I guess Sebastian Stan as the Winter Soldier. Perfect match for the Cap's moves. A level higher than the Super-soldier sometimes. Playing a villain to a superhero is not easy especially when its in the ratio of 3:1. Would love to see what the future holds for him. Also the future of Rumlov's. Good to see the Russo brothers keep the continuity of the Captain America adventure. Let's hope they do continue as they are raising the bar for themselves. Stunt Directors and VFX : You guys are the unsung hero of almost every movie in 4. It is high time people start taking you seriously. Hats Off. Do no forget to sit through the end credits.

I'm not a hater of old' Cap, but he should have died like, 100 times. And oops! I forgot one, but I'm not sure if it's just me. The story is SO predictable. I could totally tell that Bucky the Winter Soldier would eventually save Captain America from a watery grave. Speaking of, Captain A. Got about five shots in his stomach, got punched multiple times, fell from probably two thousand feet into icy cold water, yet he still lives. So realistic. Also, we see Captain fall off and the Winter Soldier still hanging on to the airship, but about a minute later we see him drag Captain to shore. How could he have found him? And how could he have jumped off a minute later, but still be at or near the site where Captain fell? Those are the cons. The few pros are 1. There are a few funny lines that made everyone crack up. 2. It has a good back-story to it. 3. there are many breathtaking moments. So, overall, we have a film that has a not-too-shabby story to it with too many pointless fighting scenes with a few funny lines and a predictable conclusion, and a film that is definitely NOT better than the Avengers and NOT what the critics claim it is.",/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014

That is electrifying when you find out who is being asked to ""save the world,"" and under which eye's view. Awesome psyche effect. Another is pitting old against new--Cap's old costume, Falcon's old suit against mega machines--are all ways to underscore old values winning out over big gun technology. This film keeps you guessing who is on which side, and you never know, until the chips are down. A question for all is, if you were the tech being commanded to pull the switch, what would your choice be? The movie invites these questions boldly to your mind, as you are put in the place of any of the individuals. The villain scenes are great in how calculated some are, and how blindly following others are. It's just as terrifying how politicos murder their everyday workers as it is how a super weapon takes a mouth bit in without question. The information age plays an important part in exposing evil as it does the weaknesses and threats any individual could be to the powers that be.

","Very good sequel that seems to be slightly overrated. That's kind of the norm with comic book movies these days, for a variety of reasons. It's not a big deal, really. Time is the true test of a movie's rating. The observation about the movie that it is less a superhero movie than a spy action/thriller is accurate, I think. Of all of the Marvel movies so far, this certainly seems to be the one least concerned with superheroics. A primary reason for this is probably due to the movie being inspired by the Cap comics of the last decade, which are much darker than they used to be and more spy stories than superhero ones. I'm not a fan but there's no point in getting into that here. For the purposes of this film, it works well and towards the end when Evans finally dons the proper Cap superhero costume (or at least the closest we'll get to it in these movies), it's a powerful moment.",/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014

",". . . ""don't trust the chain of command."" In CAPTAIN AMER1CA: THE WINTER SOLDIER, there are two types of military personnel depicted: those who follow orders from their commanding officers, even when it means carrying out a ""Pre-Emptive strike"" on 20 million civilians, including the valedictorian of an Iowa City High School (who will presumably become the grandmother of a freedom fighter in the distant future, along the lines of the TERMINATOR franchise), and those who think for themselves, such as Chris Evans, Anthony Mackie, Samuel L. Jackson, and Scarlett Johansson. Since this movie was not made in a vacuum, it obviously is ""preaching"" to the U.S. military, which owns more than half the world's martial resources. The writers no doubt are aware that a former C.I.A. chief\defense secretary who died last week--James Schlesinger--had to ""go outside"" the chain of command so that President Richard Nixon could not nuke either Vietnam or Cleveland (or perhaps both) as he fought to save his presidency. A military coup was Nixon's ""Plan B,"" but Schlesinger defied the chain of command to stop both. On the other hand, polls show many if not most Americans believe the White House plant in 2001 ordered the USAF to ""stand down"" during the terrorism attack on America, to further the interests of the oil men who put him in the Oval Office even though he lost the election. Therefore, if you have a child in the U.S. military, advise him or her AGAINST seeing CAPTAIN AMER1CA, unless you want them to prevent the next 9-11 by going against the chain of command, as Schlesinger, Evans, Mackie, Jackson, and Johansson all have done.",/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014

","This has got to be one of the best Marvel movies I have seen so far. It has just about everything I wanted to see in a Captain America movie. The first one was alright, but this one just blows the previous movie out of the water. It's just really cool to see Cap integrate and utilize his skill sets, and the movements and fighting skills was just super entertaining to watch. As a matter of fact this has one of the best hand to hand combat fights ever. The plot flows really well and the editing is done just right. The chemistry between the characters is good and just about all the characters are not wasted and actually has roles to play. Especially Nick Fury. When it comes to the action it's some of the best sequences I have ever seen. Especially since Cap doesn't really have legit superpowers all that much. So his vulnerability makes it fun, thrilling, and cool when he throws down with other human villains. Mainly because Cap and some of the villains pull of all kinds of maneuvers instead of just relying on powers and weapons (unless you count fists as weapons). And even Cap's main weapon his shield is utilized to another level. I think the bar for superhero movies when it comes to action has just gotten set to another level with this one.",/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014

","""That's not freedom, that's fear."" Steve Rogers (Evans) is still trying to adjust to life in the modern world but he does have Natasha (Johansson) and Nick Fury to help him. Thinking there may be a problem inside the walls of S.H.I.E.L.D. Fury warns Rogers not to trust anyone. He takes this to heart and when Fury is killed Rogers becomes a fugitive from the organization. He must now fight the mysterious Winter Soldier in order to avenge Fury and also to clear his name. The first thing I will talk about are the good things about this movie. The Avengers movies seem to be leaning more to the adult side with a real story line and leaning less on the special effects that earlier comic book movies fell back on. This one is no exception. It is dark and has depth to it to make you interested in what is happening rather than what is blowing up. They all do a great job of tying into each other which makes it feel like one long story rather then separate stories they attempt to tie together. On the other hand the fact that they keep pumping these movies out is what made the main plot of this movie not work. The whole movie has to deal with the leaders of S.H.I.E.L.D. becoming corrupt and Captain America being an outcast. The fact that they have already started to film Avengers 2 and have announced Captain America 3 takes away all the tension and suspense of Rogers and Fury's story lines. From the beginning you know that Fury will be fine and Rogers will clear his name and fix what is wrong with S.H.I.E.L.D. If they wanted to really have the viewer wonder what will happen they shouldn't have announced future plans for the series. To me the Avengers movies have become more of franchise done solely to make money rather than movies done to tell a story. While they do make a killing when they come out they are starting to cheapen the industry and are watering down the product. There is failure to see that the longer the series goes on the more it will take away from what has been done so far. If you don't believe me now you will when Iron Man 6, Captain America 5, Thor 6 and Avengers 7 all come out. Overall, the movie is OK and worth seeing but there is no tension or suspense already knowing what the next movie will be like.

","A nice rummage through the genre bin in search of a hybrid that hadn't yet seen the light of day: the action / adventure / superhero / political thriller. It's enjoyable enough, if a touch on the shallow, superficial side. Though it runs a bit long, I don't feel like the drama was given quite enough time to simmer and skeptics will see right through an early plot twist involving a major death (or two). The action scenes look and feel great, though, with an emphasis on physical effects in lieu of CG that pays big dividends. Scarlett Johansson gets a lot of screen time, much more than I'd expected, but feels purposeful and at-home, where Anthony Mackie's equal turn as Falcon seems forced and irrelevant. Of course, Chris Evans is vanilla but strong in the leading role and Sebastian Stan is appropriately cool-looking, if slightly under-explored, as his momentary nemesis the Winter Soldier. They probably should've kept the mask on longer, though; he seems far less menacing and visually striking without. I'm really struggling to understand why this didn't feel more substantial than it did. Even Cap's most appealing personality quirk - his disconnection from the trappings of modern society - gets little more than a cursory glance. Good but middle-of-the-pack in the Marvel family.",/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014

Cap's second standalone film improves in almost every way. When there isn't action there's suspense, both of which are managed very efficiently. Though it's hard to talk about this movie without spoiling the plot, it can and must be said that it's hard for me to imagine any of Marvel's Phase 2 films having this much of an impact on the canon. Rather than being a straight-up actioner like its predecessors, The Winter Soldier is a successfully hybridized action-thriller, with mysteries and cold stares abound. All this adds up to what is arguably the best film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, possibly even beating The Avengers or Iron Man.

","After being blown away with ""The Avengers"" (2012), I was looking forward to what they had in store next. Enter ""Iron Man 3"" (2013), an average movie, but not nearly as enjoyable as the Marvel films before it. After that, came the travesty; ""Thor: The Dark World"" (2013), a movie even worse than ""Iron Man 3""! I thought: ""what's happening? How is this possible?!"" Then came ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" (2014), directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. At first, I was a bit hesitant to see it after the substandard movies ""Iron Man 3"" and ""Thor: The Dark World"". But then I thought: ""third times the charm, and it's Marvel. They deserve one more chance."" When I went to see it, I was the only one in the theater. I'm like: ""okay, this isn't a good sign!"" But thankfully, I was 100% wrong. This movie had me on the edge of my seat the whole time! Perfect story, perfect acting, perfect soundtrack, perfect sets/locations, and of course perfect special effects! ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is another example of what I classify as a perfect movie. Not just the best Marvel Cinematic Universe film, but the best overall Marvel film, and tied with ""Superman"" (1978) as my favorite superhero movie and one of my top 10 all-time favorite films! When Marvel studios found the Russo Brothers, they struck gold. The Russo Brothers literally saved the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with this movie. This movie definitely redeemed my love for this franchise! It's one of the fastest two hours you'll ever experience watching a movie. You blink, and it'll be over! It was fun being the only person in the theater, that gave the movie a whole different viewing experience. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"", what are you waiting for?

To answer that question is yes if you watch conspiracy videos most of this stuff is happening and captain America shows that in order to stop the corruption in this world you have to be heroic even though cap is a Boy Scout it should make us all want to be hero's like him.

If you search online you'll find a nice chronological viewing order so you know how to watch the films and where they sit on a chronological list; for the purpose of this lets say that the events of the first Avengers film have unfolded, as have all the Iron Man films and just before this Cpt America film Thor 2's events have also occurred. In this film you kind of get some of the fallout of those prior events (Shield is taking a lot of stick for events in the Avengers movie as well as the Iron Man films and is getting pressured to be safer and strong with controls in place) as well as things that spill out of Cpt America's past from the first film. Steve has a lot to catch up on and just when he's making friends (The Falcon) and finding his feet in the modern world Nick Fury is killed by an assassin working for Hydra. In fact Hydra have infiltrated Shield and parts of the American (and World) government so who can Cpt America rely on. Trusting nobody it's up to Rogers, Widow and Falcon to try and stop the assassin called the Winter Soldier and save the world, even when it looks like they are on the wrong side of justice because Hydra has infiltrated and corrupted most of the ruling bodies.

","I went and saw 'Captain America' at the cinema today. An early screening at 9am, reason being it was the only session showing 2d, not a fan of 3d. I was a huge fan of 'Captain America: The First Avenger', unlike most. Therefore I may be biased in my review, but i think Winter Solider is the best Marvel/Comic movie period , well apart from 'The Avengers' & The Dark Knight'. I know that's a bold statement, but its my opinion and i stand by it. I mentioned before, that I didn't enjoy 'Iron Man' 2 or 3 and especially 'Thor 2' and hated 'Man of Steel' with a passion. I can say its the first time in a very long time, that i walked out of a movie, totally satisfied in every way, when it comes to a popcorn flick, it ticked all the boxes. The theme has an uneasy mood of a 1970s paranoia thriller, which i loved,chock-full of the breathless cliffhangers dictated by the genre, but equally rich in the quiet, tender character moments that made the first film unique among recent Marvel fare. The title along is misleading, firstly Winter Solider only makes a cameo and Captain America's is def the straight man in this flick, surrounded by such a diverse ensemble cast in the same vain as 'The Avengers'. With Nick Fury, Black Widow and others characters getting their fair share of screen time. It should have been rather be called 'S.H.I.E.L.D: Retaliation'. Its like them calling the 'The Avengers' movie, 'Iron Man: Avengers Assemble', as Tony Stark kind of played the central role in it. But we mustn't forget it was an ensemble cast, just as much as Captain America: Winter Solider is.

For example, in this movie they supposedly kill Nick Fury but then back out of it.

Captain America is finding adjusting to the modern world hard, and after being framed becomes a fugitive and tries to bring down a Shield conspiracy. What sets this apart from other Marvel films is that it's not just an action movie: It's a living, breathing narrative with characters we care about, a sense of tension and material to appeal to those who aren't fan boys. True, the film is in some ways just another Marvel movie and doesn't take a lot of risks, but the reveal of Shield being infiltrated half way through is genuinely shocking and the film is a dazzling mix of political thriller and superhero movie.",/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014

","Thawed-out war hero Steve Rogers (Evans) is ever more uneasy about his affiliation with deep-spy network S.H.I.E.L.D.. And when the organisation turns on him, he uncovers a horrifying conspiracy.
There is something pleasingly, and no doubt deliberately, ironic in Marvel Studios' flag-wearing hero fronting its most subversive movie yet. Not that writers Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus are being subtle about it. ""You're holding a gun to everyone on Earth and calling it protection,"" Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) tells Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) early on. During the very same dialogue he says, ""I thought the punishment usually came after the crime,"" and - just in case we hadn't got the point - ""This isn't freedom, this is fear."" Even so, what we have here is the key to Captain America's real appeal, the answer to any criticism that he's just a stiff-necked, steroidal boy scout. As a 95 year-old thirtysomething with an early-'40s value set in War-On-Terror America, he is less the USA's poster boy than its most steadfast foil.

","A stripped-down, more dogged entry in the ever-expanding crushing force that is the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Unwilling to rest on their laurels, Marvel with Captain America: The Winter Solider wisely swerves the increasingly flagging formulaic characteristics of the generic superhero blockbuster and explores more grown up, mature themes with its instilled political connotations of conspiracy, trusted intelligence agency infiltration and high-stakes espionage in a delectably self-assured way. The intimate close quarters, stealth driven combat scenes are akin to those of confident military actioners as opposed to Marvel's usual elaborate hulking action sequences; a refreshing deviation, although normal big-budget battling service is resumed in the latter parts of proceedings. Furthermore, new character introductions felt purposeful and detrimental to the plot and the antagonists served as believable threats not just role-fillers. Likewise, every twist was meaningful and intrinsically forced the audience to question the intentions and integrity of the characters we have come to know and invest in. With the past coming back to haunt Cap and his crew it really added weight to the ensuing events and now knowing history could come back to bite at anytime supplies food for thought to it's sister instalments still to come. Not knowing whom to trust, Capt. America felt like a real superhero in this movie, rather than just Steve Rogers, the superhuman that can run fast and jump high posing as the patriotic front of The Avengers.",/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014

It felt like he existed only to make certain scenes and plot points possible. To me, that's lazy writing. Either develop him more and add a bit more time to the film or leave him out entirely and find different ways to make things happen. I also thought Scar Jo's character still lacked much development.

","First, the sequel to our American cap is just one thing.
Questionable.
Apart from having a heavy and slow pace, and having an antagonist out of nowhere, Captain America, the Winter Soldier lacks the narrative established in the first film of the CAP, the script is mediocre, I mean, if they were going to make the cap doing winter acrobatics of the Macho hard hit, minimal would have done something more or less similar to Iron Man 2, but there is nothing here.
The CGI while it's good, well, the characters and the script stop to want, likewise, the sequences where buildings are destroyed (for example, in the Falcon scene) is re forced and nothing exciting, the final battle of Cap and Bucky does not have the taste of fresh air as It was with the Red Skull, nor if Bucky is explored well, it feels forced that only why your friend in quotes abandoned you because of you is very foolish, or if you have a good background to make the character interesting, the action sequence is still had Endo the CGI, the narrative blur of the characters, and the script, leaves the movie very bad, not counting that is boring both objectively and personally, there is almost nothing interesting, the final battle is not exciting and less interesting than with the Red Skull with the first, the script is badly exploited knowing, that the sequels of Marvel are between good and decent, is boring and, no matter how much CGI has the movie (whether it is good or bad) if you do not have a good script and a good narrative of the per Characters, will be very bad, but unlike other sequels, this came out mediocre. 2.5/5.",/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014

","As a distinguished Marvel fan( DC as well), I have found problems in adaptations that feature my favorite Marvel characters. I have criticized 20th Century Fox and how they deal with the X-Men Franchise. Recently, I have been proud of Sony in their dealing with the Spider-Man Franchise. However, No other studio has devout attention to their characters than Marvel Studios. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is Marvel Studios's finest film to date( possibly even better than The Avengers). This movie excels in every way possible. The story, script, and characters have to applauded in this movie. This movie deals with themes of Government Espionage, Conspiracies, and The true cost of Freedom which i found surprising while viewing this movie. The Biggest Shocker of the movie was *SPOILERS* when Cap and Widow find out that HYDRA has been secretly working among SHIELD in order to achieve their greatest goal: ORDER among society by using PROJECT INSIGHT: a SHIELD sort of satellite that eliminates threats to SHIELD. HYDRA uses this advantage to wipe out their threats to society in which they think will allow safety all over the world . The movie has a fair number of twists as you see SHIELD agents actually revealing their identity as HYDRA agents (Jasper Sitwell and Alexander Pierce). I was very much surprised to see this. *END OF SPOILERS* Christopher Markus and Stephen McFreely has done a great job in writing this movie. The directors: Joe and Anthony Russo has also done a great job in their direction of this movie. I had a few concerns with the 1st act due to the action and how they rushed events that were crucial to the story. The Winter Soldier was a great opponent To Cap. He had this menacing stature which i found good. *SPOIlERS* But, the true villain is Robert Redford's Alexander Pierce. His performance was good. I would loved to see Pierce's involvement with HYDRA more though. Chris Evans as Cap. did a great job and Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow had a great character development in which alludes to her past ( I hope to see this element explored in Avengers: Age of Ultron). *END OF SPOILERS* Overall, Captain America: The Winter Soldier deserves my ""GREAT JOB"" seal of approval. 9/10.",/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014

The scenes are almost always shot in a wide angle, showing each full hit. While there are many cuts, I realized that again they almost never cut on a hit, which lessens the impact of the hit so it seems much less visceral. Also, again, while there are many cuts, the action is always kept in the center of the frame, so the viewer's eyes aren't jumping all over the frame every second, trying to figure out what is going on. Finally, the character always starts at a disadvantage at the beginning of a fight scene and has to fight his way back up (particularly in one of my favorite scenes, the elevator fight).

","The first time I watched this movie I didn't pay attention to all the amazing things it has, but I decided to watch again, and I have realized that it is the best movie of Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is the ninth film produced by Marvel studios and it was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. It is a direct sequel of Captain America: The first avenger, so we follow the adventure of Captain America/Steve Rogers(Chris Evans) Black widow/Natasha Romanoff (Scarlet Johansson) and Falcon/ Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) against an occulted enemy, a corporation named Hydra which is hidden inside the most powerful government agency: SHIELD. Hydra controls the best friend of Steve rogers, Bucky Barnes called as the Winter soldier (Sebastian stand), so Captain America wants to save him. Other important characters are Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and the main enemy, Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford).
This Movie has an excellent storytelling, you always are excited about what could happen. It is not only a Superheroes movie, it has many characteristics of spy movies, It has a real breath-taking plot which affects all the MCU; And also is a critic of American way of life, what if the government could know (or believe) what crimes will happen before they actually happen? Is it right to punish the people who haven't done anything bad...yet? The Captain America don't think so, there's a moral dilemma. That's why this movie goes much far that any Marvel's movies.
The effects are spectacular, the movie has the perfect mix between practical effects and CGI, so every scene looks amazing, specifically the melee fights and the helicarriers destruction. The music is not the best, but it is okay, it gives tension and emotion when the movie needs. Another point I think is cool is that there aren't too much jokes as almost all Marvel's movies.
It is amazing, but not everything is good, there are many things that have no sense, for example, how Nick Fury could scape from the Winter soldier when his car crashed? It was a big coincidence that there was an sever just where the car stopped . And there are things about this movie that other Marvel's movies don't take care about , for example how Fury lost his eye, in Captain Marvel a cat scratched him in his eye... but in the winter soldier Nick Says "" The last time I trusted I lost an eye"" It was so stupid! Another at the end of the movie, Nick burned his patch but in avengers: Age of Ultron he has it again. It is so sad that not everything has connection between movies.
So, it is amazing, everyone who likes action, suspense, and thought-provoking movies should watch Captain America: The winter Soldier.",/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014

","As the Marvel superhero with the richest history, and linch-pin of The Avengers, Captain America was perhaps the most eagerly-awaited of the comic book behemoth's properties to come to the big screen. The First Avenger resoundingly delivered on Cap's pathos, even pulling off the re-branding Chris Evans from hothead Johnny Storm to the steel-nerved Steve Rogers, chief among an across-the-board casting masterclass, from the spunky Hayley Atwell, thru square-jawed Sebastian Stan; gravel-toned Tommy Lee Jones; specky Toby Jones; via fatherly Stanley Tucci; and dashing Dominic Cooper to Hugo Weaving's devilishly evil Red Skull. Joe Johnston's film nicely evoked a never-say-die attitude and drab wartime aesthetic to the benefit of it's jarring final scenes. So how to follow TFA's success? The challenge was to now deal with a contemporary Cap, and directors The Russos (from the screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely - who also penned The First Avenger) manage that with aplomb, not laying on the 'this is weird' shtick too thickly, while still reminding us where Cap has come from. But easily the smartest thing that they did was side-stepping the heroic trappings and big CGI (at least until the second half) to adopt the trappings of the political thriller, to great success. Why make a superhero movie at all? Why indeed, and to this end the presence of Robert Redford is a masterstroke. Scarlett Johansson is also on great form and sparks nicely with Chris Evan's Cap, while Sam Jackson's Nick Fury gets more to do in any Marvel appearance so far as the web of lies plays out.

","This time, Captain has changed his personality from a boring soldier back in the 90's to a real hero in this modern era with clear mission and vision, not only to S.H.I.E.L.D but to all the people. Unlike the siblings Thor and Loki, Captain America﻿ and the Winter Soldier have their own unique story as well as performance that appears to be balanced out rather than overshadowing each others. Although the film itself led by a bad profile director, thanks to the smart, darker with several minor twisted political plot, this has successfully converted the brand into a more mature franchise. While the development of the story might seems to follow the style of The Dark Knight's trilogy, great cinematography without any drags, beautiful old classic actions art most of the time with bare hands between the heroes and a more serious tone of scores by Henry Jackman would certainly entertain all the audiences, of course not to forget on Black Widow.

However the supporting cast of characters was a mixed bag. Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson both reprised their roles and if you liked them in previous movies, you'll like them here. I didn't feel we learnt much about their characters and by the end of the movie it felt like Scarlett Johansson's character was in the same place she started. However all three of the actors mentioned above gave great performances, and having seen the rest of the MCU movies I think the performances in general were some of the best in a MCU movie. The problem came in the new editions to the cast - I was disappointed to see Robert Redford given quite a bland character, who is an instant edition to the already crowded canvas of forgettable Marvel villains. The Winter Soldier himself felt like a kind of supporting villain without much of a role in the movie - definitely not a big enough role to name the movie after him. Although the final edition was perhaps the best character in the movie: Falcon. This was a surprisingly well written character wonderfully played by Anthony Mackie, who took a fairly large role in the film and was generally one of the most memorable aspects of this movie.",/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014

","An important matter about a superhero is that he/she must compel the viewer to believe his/her. The most important thing is not, necessarily, his power. Perhaps Captain America is not the strongest one, but I am sure he is the most reliable one. another matter that attract me is that, sometimes, I think an actor helps the character and sometimes vice versa but in this case, the character and actor both helped each other. Of course, the balance is a little for the strong character of Captain America.

830,12 April 2014,CreatorElite,10," Best Marvel Film To Date!
","Two 95 year olds beating the snot out each other sounds like a terrible attraction, but this movie did not disappoint. In the modern world of cinema, most films are faced with the burden that between the first film and it's sequel, the first film being ""The First Avenger: Captain America"", should have been a lot more successful. Surely that was not the case when it came to Captain America: The Winter Soldier. There were so many moments through-out the movie that not only made Chris Evans' shine better as the iconic hero, but it was definitely a Captain America the world needed to see. The movie cleverly and hilariously starts off with Cap(Chris Evans) meeting Sam Wilson(Anthony Mackie) A.K.A. The Falcon for the first time. The scene seemed very important and just by that alone, you knew the character had something more to the story throughout. So quickly we get welcomed into a lengthy action sequence that was probably the best I've seen in any Marvel film. Cap taking out the guards with no effort was hilarious as it was astounding. You really got to see how his character's skills evolved from the Avengers to now, especially as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. The first one on one fight scene between Cap and Georges Batroc(George ST Pierre) was beautifully a shining example of flawless fight choreography and that was only the first to what was to come. It was great to see the beautiful Scarlett Johansson return as Natasha Romanoff. In this movie, you really get to see her character open up a lot more emotionally on screen. She doesn't serve that well as eye candy, even though she is running around in a tight body suit majority of the time, highlighting her assets but she makes up for that with heart stopping fight scenes that are just as fast as Cap's. It's great to see Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury. I love how the movie told us that even the SHIELD director would get into trouble in the film in that was indeed the case. The ""Pulp Fiction"" reference near the end was definitely a laugh for me. I'll let you figure that one out. I think the straight out best performance had to be Sebastion Stan, returning to the universe as The Winter Soldier A.K.A. Bucky Barnes, Cap's childhood friend. In the beginning of the film, they do give a small summary of Cap and Bucky's relationship(which slightly helps for those who refused to watch the first film) and it helps give an emotional set back to Cap's battles with The Winter Soldier. Barnes though makes well as a menacing villain. He pretty much acts as a nemesis to Cap, matching his strength and speed, and even surpassing him; catching cap's shield a few times. As the movies goes on, you see the more human side to this villain and you realize that there is some higher power leading The Winter Soldier. Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce gave us a villain we truly wanted to hate. You think he's good and you think he's trying to do right with the good guys but then you realize he's behind the menace. It was good to see Cobie Smulders come back as Agent Maria Hill. I think many were handed that character in the Avengers very quickly in the Avengers and it would have been pretty bad to just abandoned such a leading lady. I mean we didn't want Black Widow being the only beauty on screen. Anthony Mackie as Falcon had to be my favorite and I'm sure many would say that too. Not only was he simply just cool, but for a guy that just got out of fighting wars, and just meeting Cap; he seemed very loyal to the whole ""save the world"" cause. He also displayed that he could hold his own through-out the movie. So now the post credits scene. This was the best post credit scene since IronMan. The characters they revealed were very pivotal and I loved how they used the word ""miracles"" to signify that these aren't regular people, like Stark, Romanoff and Hawkeye. They reveal that ""The Twins"", QuickSilver(Aaron Taylor Johnson) and Scarlett Witch(Elizabeth Olsen) are being held captive as test subjects. A major foreshadowing, leading to The Avengers: Age Of Ultron. The second scene(Stay after all of the credits) shows Bucky Barnes inside of the Smithsonian Museum learning about himself from the Captain America and Bucky Barnes exhibits inside the museum. This tells you clearly, that we haven't scene the last of Barnes. All in all, this movie was perfect and Marvel Comics fan or not, you're going to seriously love this movie. Fantastic movie!

838,10 June 2015,danielloe,9," Thrilling, action packed, and smart
","*WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* Captain America: The Winter Soldier is the sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger, and complements it nicely. Most sequels just go for the overused formula of bigger equals better, which rarely works out well. This time, the second movie is the continuation of the first, contrasting the differences between modern day and the time Captain America lived in. Things aren't so black and white in this movie, for awhile Cap doesn't know who to trust, and is just going off his guy instinct about what to do. This movie is about everything Captain America believes in being torn down, with SHIELD and with the Winter Soldier. Spoiler: The Winter Soldier is Bucky Barnes, Steve's best friend, so watching Steve have to fight him, is very emotional. Not only that, but the Winter Soldier is a very menacing villain. So, yes, I really liked the way they played off of the first one with this movie, and I thought that was a very good dynamic. The cast is great this time, even better than in the first movie. Chris Evans is better than ever in the titular role, and Scarlet Johansen delivers once again as the Black Widow, though her role isn't as well written this time around. Samuel L. Jackson also reprises his role as Nick Fury, and he and Cap play off of each other really well, because they each have their own contrasting ways of doing things, and as you can imagine there's a lot of friction from that. Anthony Mackie's The Falcon is a good addition, as he brings some extra charm to the movie. And, to go back to what I said earlier, I think The Winter Soldier is the perfect villain for this movie, and I much prefer him to the Red Skull, as he provides some actual menace to Captain America, as well as his numerous allies. And for the hard-core comic book fans, there's even a minor role of Crossbones. I also think this movie boasts some better action scenes, with car chases, shootouts, and three different super-heroes all running around and using their own gimmicks. The most noteworthy are (though it is very brief) the elevator scene where Cap dispatches at least a dozen Hydra cronies in an elevator, after giving them all the chance to back out. So cool! The final battle between Cap and Winter Soldier also delivers on some really hard-hitting emotion as well as a very tense duel, as they are standing on a cat-walk, really high in the air. This is the quintessential Captain America movie here, but then again so is the first one, it's just that they each tell a different type of Captain America story, each one equally iconic. Most superhero movies in a series tell a very similar story, so it was very refreshing to see something so different. I just hope that the Civil War will live up to the first two, giving us something original, instead of just two and a half hours filled with poorly timed jokes and so many characters you need an index to keep up with them. Which brings me to another point: the tone. There are jokes in this movie, but they are timed well, and they feel more intelligent. These feel like things real people would say, not jokes bordering on fourth-wall breaking. I also like the way they handled such a large cast, in that each character was well developed, but we had a clearly defined main cast. In the end Captain America the Winter Soldier is a great movie, with a stellar cast, great action, a great story, a good tone, and makes for a great follow up to the first one.",/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014

","The best Marvel Cinematic Universe film there has ever been, with the exception of The Avengers. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is first and foremost a political thriller with the essence of a superhero movie. Returning to the role of Steve Rodgers, I can safely and assuredly say that Chris Evans is Captain America. One of the best parts of this sequel was the chemistry between the actors, especially between Evans and Scarlett Johansson. The dialogue they share stays compelling and doesn't feel forced at all. And speaking about not feeling forced, Anthony Mackie joins the cast as The Falcon. This could've easily been one of the weak points of the film, as history has proved that the addition of a sidekick tends to backfire on the film. However, Mackie does a great job in providing humour and playing a character that Rodgers can truly identify with and befriend, as they are both war veterans and have similar outlooks on life. Samuel Jackson has appeared in his fair share of Marvel films, yet he was always just a voice in the background. That couldn't be farther from the truth in Marvel's newest addition to their cinematic universe because Nick Fury finally gets down and gritty. The action has never been better and greater than they are here. From the martial arts style fights to the epic set piece battles to an incredibly shot car chase scene, this film will not only amaze superhero fans but action fans as well. Many people are interested about the Winter Soldier and if he is a worthy and menacing antagonist, and the answer to that question is an emphatic yes. Sebastian Stans's performances reminds me of Tom Hardy's Bane from The Dark Knight Rises in that both men have most of their face covered, with their eyes telling a story all on their own. Being the figure in the shadows and suddenly appearing out of nowhere throughout the movie was fantastic as it helped maintain the tone that the directors were gunning for. This is Marvel's response to The Dark Knight in terms of its dark and gritty approach, tackling spy and political themes that are very relevant in today's world. The Russo brother's directing of this film, I think, was probably the best aspect of it. They did a marvellous job in transitioning from the action scenes to the comedy, and then to the emotional character driven moments. Not to be out shined, the script was the best of the Marvel movies, and a large part of that was the character development, which some superhero movies tend to lack. Is it a great superhero movie? Yes. Is it a great MOVIE? Yes. Does it take the genre and go beyond its own limitations and journey into uncharted territory, just as The Dark Knight did? Yes.

","Title: Just..FANTASTIC!! I just saw this movie because I'm a huge comic-book fan of super-heroes. And I had seen that a local newspaper had given this a great rating so I thought of giving it a try. And man, this was MUCH better than I thought it would be! Everything and I mean everything about the movie is greatstory, acting, dialogs, fight-sequences, action, direction. This movie is full of class. I can happily say that this is WAY better than ALL the Superman, Batman, Spiderman, Ironman and Hulk movies that I've ever seen! Yes sir! The credit for this movie should go to the story-writers and the directors. They've done a marvelous job. Chris Evans has done a brilliant portrayal of Captain America..he was like tailor-made for this role. All the other main and supporting cast have done terrific job. Robert Redford was outstanding in his not-that- big but crucial role. I have never seen any movies of his before but now I can see the reason why he's so popular! The only acting that I wasn't satisfied with , was Sebastian Stan who plays Winter Soldier in the movie. Though he character didn't have much to speak, but still somehow I felt his acting as hollowhe could done more justice to his role. The friendship between Captain America Aand Falcon was very nicely shown. The way they get to know each other and soon become allies in battle, was shown very effectively and convincing way. The stunts were amazing in the movie. We see Captain America do a variety of different moves/attacks with his shield, which is just a treat to watch! The major plot of the theme , that is, about the Winter Soldier is taken from one of the story lines in the Captain America Comics , written by Ed Brubaker. For those who don't know, Ed Brubaker is arguably THE best writer r Captain America comics! In fact, he's the reason I started reading Captain America.Never used to bother about it before. Now some minor complaints about the movie: 1) The title ""Winter Soldier"" doesn't make much sense because his role is quite less and his role is actually not THAT important in the movie. 2) For those into comics, they will understand when I say that this movie (and other recent MARVEL movies) are based on the ""Ultimate"" Universe, not the usual (or whatever you call it) Marvel universe. I would have preferred it the other way, since that is the original. The ""Ultimate"" universe came much after the ""regular"" universe. 3) Most of the times Captain America is without the mask. Maybe no big deal, but I generally like it when the Super heroes keep their masks on most of the time. That's how it was/is in comics.

","Where do I start, Well if you like formulaic, predictable, bad guys are so awesome, and there henchmen can't hit nothing, combined with predictable plots, and over the top fight and carnage scenes, then you will love this movie, you really will. But if you like plot, real surprises, somewhat plausible fiction action, then I think you may not. Let me mention the cliché fight scenes, with the stand issue unaware armed bad guys, who senses nothing is amiss, or that can't hit the broad side of a barn with a spray of bullets ever? Or maybe people crashing through glass and walls and not a scratch or injury, and those are not even the super heroes! or maybe the predictable plot, we just sat and guessed with 80% accuracy on every character,motive or situations as they were introduced or started. I read captain America comics from the mid 60s to 70s, and many reissues a a kid of back in the 40s. They should have just ended all the superheroes by the early 80s, they have all gotten so much like soap operas, bad karate flicks, and all special effects at the neglect of a good believable characters and plots within the fictitious super hero world. Now I do have to say the convenient light traffic and near empty D.C. city streets for mayhem scenes, how original (yawn. Hollywood puts so much over the top stuff in each of these new super hero films , that everyone who has a listed part is a superhero even if there a staff worker in a random office. dead bodies everywhere, major carnage in the street, and several hours later Captain America had no knowledge of what happened down town that was near equal to 911. amazing! I'm glad i got a movie editor program, I'll be trimming the junk to nite this will be a 70 minute movie if I'm lucky. . Please just not so predictable and less special effects that are nothing but to far fetched to be even plausible even for fiction.

Unlike the other phase 2 movies in the marvel universe which I did not enjoy that much , this film relies on a aspect of superhero movies we haven't seen instead of cheesy clichéd stories, it makes itself more of a spy thriller that reminded me a lot of the Bourne franchise with some superhero aspects such as over the top fight scenes. The direction the Russos take this film in is a game changer as literally every marvel movie following this film will have to adapt to the new events that have occurred. Also The Winter Soldier is a bad ass villain that I thought was kinda like a terminator of the marvel franchise, he was brutal, powerful and made for a very emotional villain who is on par with Loki as best villain of the marvel universe.

","I half wanted to see this, as I'm not the biggest fan of Marvel's film franchise. The first Captain America was less than convincing to say the least, and he's never been anywhere near my favorite comics character. But here he's a badass! The action sequences are pure eye-candy. CGI is kept to a minimum (or at least -- the minimum a superhero movie would allow). The fighting choreography is fast paced and varied, the Cap isn't overpowered or getting his ass handed to him all the time (like movie Wolverine). His powers are developed in an ingenious way and don't deviate from the source material, to please the Avengers fans out there. Chris Evans' performance is solid, even though the Captain can be annoying at times with his naive outlook on today's world. Still, those are only fleeting moments, and overall, the character is quite likable. There's definitely a nice dynamic with Scarlett Johansson, who is convincing as a more fleshed out Black Widow. The tone of the movie is quite different from other Marvel blockbusters: it's much darker, more inspired by high tension thrillers. Obviously, the plot doesn't hold up to any Robert Redford classic, and isn't all that deep but then who would go into a Marvel movie expecting Citizen Kane or the Manchurian Candidate? The weak link here is the antagonist, who is definitely poorly handled. I didn't remember him from the first movie and honestly didn't care about the emotional aspect of his confrontation with the Cap.

It is probably the best political movie disguised as a super hero movie in decades. Captain America is still on a journey to understand his new present day.

After a fun filled action sequence, we find Black Widow doing what she does best, espionage. Cap not liking the fact the mission has sub missions he knew nothing about, he faces Fury about it, not knowing Fury set the whole thing up. Once Fury's superiors realize what he has done, he (Fury) goes to the one man he can trust. Cap. After telling him just enough to give Cap what he needs to start his quest. Cap and Natasha go on a mission against seemingly everyone and eventually team up with Sam Wilson, who nails his role as Falcon. As they search for answer against gov't foes and the mysterious Winter Soldier, the risks become more then anyone could imagine. To not give away the entire plot, I'll leave it there.

","Captain America The Winter Soldier is not perfect film but is the perfect comic book film. If you pay attention enough you'll notice some conveniences and clichés and lapses in cinematography that are aside from it being a comic book film and could've been fixed/avoided and made the film slightly better. But boy is this film freaken awesome in almost every way. People talk about this film as an espionage type film, and it is one in many ways and it does that very very well with great tension put up throughout the film and very clever moments fitting of a good espionage film and has some great commentary on the War on Terror and the ethical conflict between Captain America and (to those familiar with Marvel Comics) the ideology of Iron Man and S.H.I.E.L.D. (not that Iron Man appears in the film, though is referenced here and there, which is cool). For me personally, I loved how Hydra in the film carry out their plan, because it makes sense and is a very smart, very clever, very despicable plan, and makes for a smart film. But it is also surprisingly a great hero film - the kind that will inspire the good side in you, especially from Captain America. Man, that guy is a hero and a true friend, and just on these points I've mentioned, this is probably my all time favorite hero film and a very refreshing approach on MCU films. Let's talk about the characters. I've mentioned Captain America as a real hero, and I say that because of the way he talks, the dialogue coming from him, the actions he does, THE AWESOME FIGHTING AND ESPIONAGE SCENES WITH THIS GUY (I MEAN WOW!), his morals and willingness to do what is right, his loyalty, the charming quirks here and there, and the way he is portrayed by Chris Evans. At this point, I can't imagine anyone else as Captain America. Chris Evans could've very easily been just some pretty boy with abs, but Chris Evans really fits the role of a hero. He has that honest face and voice needed for when Captain America speaks and acts, and he has the physique and expression for violent action that make for great actions scenes. We also have Black Widow, and while I did not see the point in some of the things she said to Captain America (like in the beginning), is actually a really great addition to Captain America, as not only is she a badass, but she also has real conflict and whenever she is not in her fun, badass mode, she actually has great emotion and realness to her, and as with Chris Evans for Captain America, Scarlett Johanson plays her really well. The thing about her character is that very easily she could've been played as this badass with nothing else going for her, and usually actresses that play those roles are not all that great. Scarlett Johanson, however, does not follow that trend, and she has some really great moments with her character, and I'm glad that she played the role of Black Widow. And not enough people are talking about how fun and great Falcon is, played by Anthony Mackie. Not only does he have really fun moments and awesome action scenes, but he makes for a true friend to Captain America, and I love that and really look forward to seeing him and Captain America more together. Now we don't really need to talk about Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury being awesome, because of course he is! All the dialogue coming out of that man's mouth is so awesome and fitting for the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. and for the actor of Samuel L. Jackson. One character that kind of stole the show, though, is the Winter Soldier. Oh my word is there such depth and moral conflict and moments of greatness in action and in emotion from the character that I don't believe there has been a villain like him that I've seen in a long time. His relationship with one of the characters really really hits you right in your gut and by the end of it, THE FEELS!!! OH MY WORD!!! THE FEELS! Now, I did mention in the beginning that this is not a perfect film, and just to expand on that, there were a few moments where things were a bit convenient (like say, when Winter Soldier goes after Nick Fury but for some reason takes a slow walk to him, which allows Nick Fury to escape) or clichéd (I don't want to mention to keep this review spoiler free) or a bit too much on the side of exposition and dumbing-down for the audience (like at times, Captain America was not quick enough to follow the logic, not because the character was like that but because the film was attempting to explain to the audience), but there is no way on Earth any of that detracts from the film, and that is why I give this film a perfect score, even though it is imperfect. And for you who rolls your eyes at someone giving a perfect score to an imperfect film, just say I rounded up ;).",/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014

","When I first saw the trailer, I thought the movie was going to suck even more than its predecessor. Well, I'm glad to say I was wrong, this one is actually pretty decent. It follows the Cap's adventures in the present day, where/when he finds himself on the run from SHIELD, which turns out to have been infiltrated by his old enemy, Hydra. This is a nice twist, and doubly so because this time Hydra is actually efficient for a change. They take over the very organization that was founded to counter threats like them, they have a solid plan for world domination, and Captain America actually has to break a sweat to bring them down. He is assisted by the Black Widow, but she mostly plays the part of the token woman, along with the token black guy, although she has her moments. The titular Winter Soldier feels tacked on; he turns out to be the Cap's old buddy, but, since he lacks his memory, or any personality to speak of, the revelation feels pointless. Essentially, he is a badass with a metal arm who acts as Hydra's unthinking enforcer, so his background is completely irrelevant and only serves as a distraction. Fortunately, this aspect of the story doesn't take up too much screen time. Most of that is taken up by action and good old butt-kicking, which is what a movie like this is supposed to be about, although one can't help thinking, ""Where was Iron Man during all this?"" There are also unobtrusive references to classics like Star Wars and Pulp Fiction that I enjoyed. I recommend this movie.",/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014

900,6 April 2014,jgunsenhouser,9," Best Post Avenger Installment yet...
","By the last half hour of the movie, you're thinking, ""Are they really gonna do this?""..and the answer is YES, they're really gonna do this. The commercials for TWS are stating that this movie changes everything for the Marvel Cinematic Universe and that isn't an exaggeration. Avengers: Age of Ultron will be the culmination of the Marvel Phase 2 leading into Phase 3 and if they're willing to shake things up this much, then fans better gear up for an experience. The storyline is more solid and suspenseful than the Avengers and will send ripples into all future Marvel Avenger-based installments. The action is eye-popping and jolting, including a scene involving an elevator that was probably a lot of fun for Chris Evans to perform. He truly took it up a notch for this film, as well, because the action/fighting scenes were brutal, fast and non-stop warranting a ""Whoa!"" every 30 seconds. Scarlett Johannsen and Anthony Mackie made for perfect counterparts to Evans' soldier, each providing key hero moments of their own. But the real standout here is the one and only, super spy himself, S.H.I.E.L.D Director Nicholas J. Fury, once again brought to spectacular clarity by the incomparable Samuel L. Jackson. He has a chase scene early on that sets the pace for the action for the rest of the movie and makes one of the smoothest escapes you'll ever see in a superhero movie. Cobie Smulders is also appropriately set as Fury's right hand Agent Hill once again and comes through with a clever rescue of her own reminding us that even Fury needs people he can trust. She proves pivotal in the final act assisting Cap, Falcon and Black Widow with the big save. And Robert Redford, well, he's Robert Redford...there's isn't a second of screen time where he isn't completely convincing and commanding complete attention, but, then again, he's Robert Redford, so there is a bit of expectation for his presence. And every heavy needs a trigger man/guinea pig, and his is none than the Winter Soldier, who is as enigmatic as he is familiar and gives Cap some of the most brutal and jaw-dropping fight scenes you'll ever see in a superhero movie. Probably the only time you'll ever see someone else catch Cap's shield. And let's not forget about Mr. Marvel himself, Mr. Stan Lee with one of the funniest cameo lines I've ever heard (after realizing that a certain suit is missing from a certain museum). By the end, Rogers, Sam Wilson, Romanoff and Fury mark out their new respective paths and objectives, which will surely meld into what will become the next standard for the superhero film genre-Avengers: Age of Ultron. Marvel has raised the stakes has only they can and all we can do is wait for the roller-coaster to continue.

","'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' is a film that needs no introduction. What directors Joe and Anthony Russo (who, might I add, were originally known for their work on comedies before they were hired to direct this) managed to accomplish with this film is quite impressive. Simply put, they managed to give us one of the most tightly-scripted outings of the MCU with a story that pays homage to classic 70's spy thrillers while also addressing Captain America's jump from the simpler days of World War II to the morally grey ordeals of the modern world. And it's all tied to one of the MCU's greatest twists that takes the franchise in a completely new direction. The action sequences are incredible and Chris Evans, Scarlett Johannsson, and Samuel L.

","It starts out as most marvel movies do with a mission, and a good showcase of how bad ass the cap is. Then it delves into an insane twist that I didn't see coming at all. With S.H.I.E.L.D. being compromised by Hydra for years, and about to launch a program that will use the three new Helicarriers in concert with an algorithm designed by the late (But still alive due to his mind being downloaded to a mainframe Howard Stark owned) Dr. Arnim Zola has created to kill anyone he sees as a potential threat to Hydras endgame. Captain America already doesn't want Project Insight to launch even before he realizes its complete nefarious objective. This is because he believes in the constitution, and that we shouldn't sacrifice freedoms for security. The movie definitely gets you thinking when it is explained how Hydra changed its mode of operation sense Hitlers failure in trying to forcibly take over the population, and now has created wars and enough conflict and fear mongering that make us Americans literally just lie down and accept, if not ask for something or someone to rule us (Its not that obvious, but that's what seems to be happening now in real life. Look @ the NSA programs and how much the government can see, read, and hear basically anything they want to)so as to ""Keep us safe"". But sense Captain America is strong, and smart, they (Hydra) needs a weapon, and that's there Bucky ""The Winter Soldier"" comes in. Obviously whatever tests the Doc was doing to him before he was rescued by the cap had some kind of an effect. Exp when you see him fall from a train that's like 300 ft in the air, and all of this back in 1940 something. So he's lived for years (But they show a picture of him inside of what looks like a Cryo-Chamber, so maybe that's how he's lived long and is still young) and is now mind controlled to fulfill evil operations for devious men (Hydra operatives) and it is a difficult conflict that Cap has to fight him to complete his mission of stopping Project Insight from becoming fully operational. Overall its an amazing movie that follows the enormous footsteps of its predecessors, and fills their shoes perfectly. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes action movies, and if you're a nerd, or a comic book fan, then obviously this is a must see!

Maybe it's the character or maybe it's because they wanted genuinely real dialogue but the movie feels real and believable even though the concepts are still wild. It's truly better than most comic-book movies have ever delivered. All the dramatic beats really click. Steve Rogers is indeed troubled but he leans on his moral conviction and does not fold under modern pressure. He is so well written and displays true character establishment and development over the course of the previous two films that we've seen him in.

Everything he does is BADASS! There are also some other good actors as-well, it also feels like a marvel film, and not a war 1940's film, CGI and Special effects looked good, and the action scenes were mercifully satisfying. However, I have spoken negatively as I watched this. This film felt like a hybrid of GTA And metal gear solid fused into a movie, some parts of the film felt rehashed from the 1st movie, the shield team and its villain looked like a bad Rip off of shredder and the foot clan from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Nick Furry had some dumb scenes.

","We're done with Iron Man 3 and Thor 2: The Dark World, now Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe brings us Captain America: The Winter Solder. From Joe and Anthony Russo, the directors of You, Me, and Dupree- no, you didn't read that wrong- comes the follow-up to the 2011 superhero flick Captain America: The First Avenger. Taking place 2 years after the events from The Avengers, we find Steve Rogers working with S.H.I.E.L.D while simultaneously trying to adapt to the new world. But all isn't what it seems as Steve, with the help of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and the new-edition to the team Sam Wilson AKA Falcon (Anthony Mackie), begins to unravel a conspiracy in SHIELD and tries to uncover the truth behind the deadly assassin known as the Winter Soldier. There have been many superhero movies in the past 9 years or so. We've seen comic book material be adapted to the screen in a multitude of different ways. We've seen it done dark and gritty like in The Dark Knight, we've seen it done light and witty like in Iron Man, and then we saw whatever the hell Green Lantern was doing. If there is anything we've learned from all of this, it's that Hollywood hasn't completely nailed down a sustainable formula for how to make a great comic book movie. Both ways certainly have their flaws; many people don't like the constant comedy in the Marvel movies, and many people don't like the feeling of sadness and depression one gets from watching a DC movie- very hard to pick. Sarcasm aside, I find myself leaning towards Marvel. While I'm all for trying something new and I do think that The Dark Knight is the best comic book movie to date, it's also the only film using that formula that I really cared for. Batman Begins was fine, but The Dark Knight Rises and Man of Steel never sat right with me. Rises was probably one of the messiest and worst written superhero films I've seen, and Man of Steel was DOA by using a tone that didn't mesh well with the source material- in my opinion. So naturally, I went into this movie fully aware that it could be great or it could be a disappointment; especially seeing as how comic book movies seem to be hit-or-miss of late. I'm thrilled to say, it was great. In fact, it very well may be one of the best superhero movies ever made, and that IS saying a lot. There's so much that this film did well, like the action. The action scenes in this film were extremely well-choreographed and even better, they were timed perfectly. They were spread apart well so that each fight scene was included to move the plot forward, not to just have cool stuff on screen. It's just like what George Lucas once said, ""Special effects are just a tool, a means of telling a story. People have a tendency to confuse them as an end to themselves. A Special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing."" I of all people understand the irony of George Lucas saying this, but regardless, it's still true. The Russo brothers as well as the screenwriters have a grasp on this concept; something Zack Snyder needs. While the action was excellent, what really made this movie shine was the plot. The Dark Knight was so ground-breaking because it took it's comic book source material and turned it into a crime thriller. Captain America 2 is just as ground-breaking, for it decided to deviate from the past Marvel movies and effectively make a 70's-ish political spy thriller. At the beginning of this review I made a point of saying that there is a clear difference in tone when it comes to DC and Marvel. DC is dark and realistic, and Marvel is more fantastical and light. This was probably the first film in the MCU that began to cross that line. It brilliantly took the realism and seriousness in plot from DC, while also maintaining the witty humor in dialogue and fun from Marvel. A perfect combination for a near-perfect film. In the end, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is undoubtedly one the best comic book movies today, if not one of the best action movies today. It has a great plot and great characters. The lead villain is terrifying and actually poses as a good threat to not just Cap but everyone. There's great action while also delivering a thought-provoking and surprisingly heartfelt story. It may not reach the levels of epicness proudly owned by The Dark Knight and The Avengers, but it comes pretty darn close; and it gives me hope that we are on track to reach that level once again.",/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014

","Amazing Twists, big story. You heard the audience go ""Oooh!"" on some scenes that you never saw coming. It is a big movie. Still it didn't feel as great as watching Iron Man I or the Avengers. And I wondered why. I think the difference is in the lead actor. Although Scareltt Johansson has a big part in the movie and is fantastic in it, Chris Evans is just not that good. He has a great body. He does a decent Job. Maybe he doesn't understand the essence of what makes Captain America a great man. But he just isn't as good as RDJ. Maybe you'd argue that nobody is. But I think that Marvel should try to cast great actors first. Not just a good actor with a spectacular body, but the other way around. We have seen that great actors are willing to transform themselves into Greek gods, but it is much harder to get a decent performer with a great body become a charismatic actor. Anyway it is a great Popcorn movie. It is highly entertaining.

Rather than use the source material to create another action blockbuster with a recognizable superhero lead, the filmmaker instead made The Dark Knight as a dark crime thriller that happened to feature Batman as the lead detective. To say it ""legitimized"" the genre is reductive to some of the fantastic movies that were released before it, but its unique approach garnered deserved attention from those who might not otherwise be interested in cape-and-cowl wearing vigilantes. Of course, in that same time span, Marvel Studios has left an equally impactful mark.

","In Captain America, Captain America (Chris Evans) is forced to go up against an old enemy that was believed to be dead and gone, a new enemy who he thought he could count on, and also deal with a part of his past that he is not ready for. The action is terrific in this film. Sure, car chases, gun battles, and secrets have all been done before, but they take the action way above all other films. The plot is not hard to follow, but that is not a bad thing. It is paced just right to go along with the character of Captain America. Sometimes films try to have too many plot twists and it just becomes confusing or doesn't make any sense at all, but this movie has a good twist to it that fits so well. Of course Samuel L.

","I was getting so hype for this movie ever since I saw the trailer of the winter spoiler catching the captain's shield, and when I actually saw this, I was like meh.... first what I liked about this movie was that, 1. Captain America was so boss but only at certain parts (didnt liked the end personally) 2. Hot girls everywhere (like I mean everywhere) 3.action was pretty good (it was just decent) 4. The winter soldier ( man when he first comes in. He looks and acts so damn cool, and I personally think he was the best character) now what I don't like 1. The damn camera guy (I really hate the camera guy, the entire time I could barley see what was going on, like how can I enjoy the action if the camera guy was shaking the entire time, seriously it's so bad) 2.the plot (if your not too familiar with the comics or not following the movies, you are going to be mad confused on what's going on, I know I was) 3. The same already used plot (the plot for this movie seemed like everybody else had already done before and when I finished watching I was like should have seen that coming, when you see it you'll see what I mean) I don't want to feel to negative here, and discourage you from watching this.

I had a nice experience watching the Phase One Marvel films from the original Iron Man until The Avengers because Phase One marks the beginning of this incredible Cinematic Universe Marvel has made. I did enjoy the first Captain America movie but this sequel takes it to a whole new level in terms of style, execution and storytelling which by the way is full of surprises that has never been done in a Marvel movie. To my surprise I like this film even better than the first film because ever since Iron Man 3 Marvel is brave enough when making their movies, they seriously showed proof when this film was made and makes you feel excited about the next Phase Two Marvel films. First of the action is intense and well choreographed. Everything in the movie is superbly suspenseful and very intense all the action scenes are well done combined with outstanding realistic practical effects and less CGI. Second of all the story is well paced and amazing. When the Winter Soldier appears on screen for the first time it was so shocking and intense how he was introduced. Last but not least the overall execution is amazing because this film is not only a Superhero film, but it also acts as a Conspiracy Thriller in the vein of Three Days At The Condor and The Parallax View along with The Dark Knight since both movies deal with similar themes and just imagine this movie being directed and written by Christopher Nolan and you get the idea of this film and the performances of the casts is really cool and amazing at the exact same time.

Robert Redford is a very compelling character and presence on screen. The action scenes were fantastic when I saw the resume of the Russos's movies I was a little worried, now I think they might have to worry about being type cast as action movie directors. There are a few changes from the comic book story line but they are not distracting. The Winter Solider is a movie that greatly expands and shakes the foundation of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Not that the plot was quite clever, it just wasn't developed very well. Although, I still enjoyed it and didn't get bored. It was very entertaining with the humour and action and everything in between. I thought it was over-hyped because in screen junkie's honest trailer for it, they said and i quote, ""its the best stand alone MARVEL film since Iron Man'. It really wasn't. To be honest, I preferred Thor: The Dark World. The performances were great. Chris Evans really proved that he could play a cool Captain America. And Sam Jackson, as always, was awesome (i mean that scene where he's in the car chase was damn cool). I also liked that little Pulp Fiction reference at the end there. On Nick Fury's (Sam Jackson BTW) grave stone it read 'Col. Nicholas James Fury. The Path of the Righteous Man... (Ezekiel 25.17)'. This made me laugh. Pulp Fiction is my favourite movie of all time.

","Captain America's second solo outing in the MCU was something that I wasn't sure about at first. Some plot points can be a bit confusing upon your first viewing if you are not paying super close attention to every little detail. However, upon my second viewing, it all came together. In my opinion, there are only 3 comic book films that are good movies, not just superhero movies. These are movies with deep characters and complex story elements. Those 3 movies are Dark Knight, Logan, and Winter Soldier; this movie is amazing. First off, this film really does Captain America justice. He is so awesome in this movie. Just in the first ten minutes you really start to buy into the idea that he is the greatest soldier in history. I like the Russo brothers vision of the character in this film. Cap is the definition of the American Dream; the moral guy who was your great neighbor; but now in 2014, things aren't exactly the same. He quickly realizes he can't just trust anybody that easily, even his allies. Nick Fury and Natasha Romanoff are fantastic characters to have in this film for that exact reason. We know Cap can trust them, but they are still very, very complex people with shady personalities. SHIELD is hiding very big secrets and when Cap has an unknown mercenary after him, things get more out of hand. The pacing in this film is excellent. It has frequent action but there is one time where roughly 25 minutes go by without any action, but I wasn't bored at all, The things that happen in there are interesting story and character building. The film has a great look. The CGI is polished in a way that fits well with this political thriller theme. A lot of people don't like this movie, and I sort of understand, it's easy to get lost.

The film is a unique type of superhero film as it feels more like a political action thriller which allows the film to explore and question real world ideals which makes the film compelling and valuable. This separates the film from other superhero film as this film actually considers actions and consequences. Also Black Widow is at her hottest in this film as she looks STUNNING and gorgeous in every scene, making the film worth watching on her looks alone.

They joined up with another friend -an ex Shield soldier - and destroyed Hydra. Steve's friend Paki, had his short term memory erased and is tasked to kill Rogers. Fortunately, he realized that Steve was his best friend and stopped fighting.

Personally, I could do with a few less explosions and over-the- top martial arts-type fights and instead have a little more plot and character development. I think the thing is; with a little more character development, the viewer cares more about who will win the fight, or survive the explosion, rather than just being mesmerized by the loud special effects and fights that are, in reality, so wildly absurd they are to the point of being silly. Maybe the movie is trying for ""silly"". There's nothing wrong with a movie giggle. I'm just not sure that I was giggling with them, or at them.

You could really relate to what was going on with Cap. I also really like how flawlessly this movie mixed action and humor. In Thor: The Dark World, I felt like they were trying to force in the humor, but not in this movie. They really did a great job mixing the two together. The character's were also written so well.

Captain America: The Winter Soldier delivers one of the best films Marvel have made so far. There's plenty of action in the film to keep you entertained as well as a conspiracy that will have you guessing as the film progresses. The overall tone of the film is more serious than the previous Captain America film, but still finds room for plenty of humour. I have found Chris Evans to be quite dull in his role of Captain America in previous films, but his best performance as the character so far is definitely in The Winter Soldier. Scarlett Johansson gives an impressive performance as Black Widow and steals a lot of the scenes she's in. Samuel L. Jackson is as great as ever in his role as Nick Fury. I think the film did an excellent job of how they portrayed The Winter Soldier and Sebastian Stan did a fine job as the character. I would definitely like to see Anthony Mackie as The Falcon again in future Marvel films. I also enjoyed the fact UFC Welterweight Georges St-Pierre made a brief appearance.

Captain America: The Winter Solider takes place in a world after the Chitauri invasion of New York and after the events of Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is now working for SHIELD alongside Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Agent Rumlow (Frank Grillo) as part of the Strike team. The Strike Team was on a mission to re capture a secret SHIELD ship captured by Batroc the Leaper (George St.Pierre). Rogers during the mission with Widow, discovers that she has another secret mission from Nick Fury(Samuel L Jackson) to extract data from the ship's computer. Cap growing tired of SHIELD's secrecy and the 'punish those before they punish you' attitude confronts Fury about the mission and about the secretive Project: Insight. Fury explains that Insight takes 3 high-tech Hellicarriers and links them to spy satellites to take out threats before they arrive. Cap leaves upset and Fury goes to decrypt the data Romanoff retrieved and finds that he can't. Concerned Fury goes to his friend and senior official for SHIELD Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) to hold off Insights debut until he can investigate his concerns a little longer. Pierce agrees and tells Fury to let him know what he finds. As Fury travels to meet his #2 Deputy Commander Maria Hill (Colbie Smulders) he is attacked by soldiers dressed as cops. Fury attempts to get off the grid but runs into the assassin know as the Winter Solider (Sebastian Stan).",/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014

But when I watched this movie - BOOM !!!!!!! This movie blew my mind.... It is really AWESOME!!! There are many sequences that will make you jump up in your seats. I would like to recommend you to stay after the credits for two amazing scenes, now this is hardly a spoiler as everyone knows marvel always treats the audience with surprising after credits scenes.

","It is really good. Watched in 3D. Full of action. Contains a very good storyline with connection to Captain America : First Avenger.There was a time, not that long ago, when the long Memorial Day Weekend at the end of May marked the official start of the lucrative summer movie season - that time of the year when the Hollywood studios roll out the big guns for popcorn-minded moviegoers who have nothing on their minds except having a good time.Markus and McFeely also infuse the smart, clever and twist-filled screenplay - which itself is based on a landmark 2005 comic book storyline - with an infectious sense of fun, wit, confidence and heart. In addition, directors Anthony and Joe Russo move the 2 hour and 16 minute proceedings along at a steady and engaging pace that favors character development and thrilling hand-to-hand combat over mind-numbing computer-generated special effects.",/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014

First time Marvel tries a different genre other than sci- fi/action/superhero style. Marvel treads in new territories of political suspense thrillers. This movies changes the face of Phase 2 and gives it a new direction with HYDRA regaining its ground by growing within SHIELD and the new dangers associated with it, as it tries to regain world order.It also introduces us to the new character of Avengers 2 - Quicksilver & his twin sister scarlet witch who have been described to be from the age of miracles.The dialogs are motivating which suits the patriotic character of Captain America and he is shown as a true leader which he is.

","Captain America: The Winter Soldier, film number 9 in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a most relevant one at that. The directors, producers and writers all said it was the one that followed most closely to The Avengers and would go almost directly into Avengers: Age of Ultron and all-in-all a big game-changer; they weren't kidding. The movie is unlike the rest, it doesn't quite seem like a Marvel movie most of the way through but rather a really unique spy movie, which it is. The plot is extremely well done, I loved it from beginning to end, very good points that flowed the story and even some twists that pleasantly surprised me. The new characters they brought in were fantastic, the Falcon I especially enjoyed, his character was cool, comedic, and just an enjoyable person to watch; Robert Redford's political character was also on top form although the characters' traits and ambitions I have seen in other movies. Now talking of characters, the movie's subtitle the Winter Soldier was a fantastic, unique character who's life was deep and interesting to watch, the majority may know of his true identity already as Marvel haven't really done anything to cover it up as it is obvious from about 5 mins of casting research, but I felt the character wasn't used as much as I thought; his name is in the title but his story isn't the main arc, he was in less scenes than I expected. Another disappointer for me was that the climax seemed to have a lot more violence than previous ones, not as graphic as Thor: TDW, but certainly quite strong, almost distracting - although that may have been the cinema experience. In the end I thought Captain America: The Winter Soldier was one of the best of the MCU, and even Marvel movies in general.",/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014

","This is one of those movies that fit with the times of it's release. With a nation under surveillance, drones flying the globe, a questionable administration, this movie makes no bones about where it stands. It is probably the best political movie disguised as a super hero movie in decades. Captain America is still on a journey to understand his new present day. After a nice set up through a little humor where we meet Sam Wilson, after this fateful meeting we get started with Black Widow and Cap on a mission to save a ship full of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents being held by none other than Batroc the Leaper. After a fun filled action sequence, we find Black Widow doing what she does best, espionage. Cap not liking the fact the mission has sub missions he knew nothing about, he faces Fury about it, not knowing Fury set the whole thing up. Once Fury's superiors realize what he has done, he (Fury) goes to the one man he can trust. Cap. After telling him just enough to give Cap what he needs to start his quest. Cap and Natasha go on a mission against seemingly everyone and eventually team up with Sam Wilson, who nails his role as Falcon. As they search for answer against gov't foes and the mysterious Winter Soldier, the risks become more then anyone could imagine. To not give away the entire plot, I'll leave it there. This movie has quickly become one of my all time favorites. Probably one of the greatest super hero movies put to film. Great story, action and visual effects (only used when absolutely necessary), it is entertainment that makes you think. Certainly about current events, but not to the point of pointing fingers at anyone. ""This isn't freedom. This is fear.""",/review/rw3090477/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_America_The_Winter_Soldier_2014

","It is an amazing movie. Written by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, this movie is awesome. Steve Rogers, Scarlett Johanson, Samuel L. Jackson are perfectly casted in the movie and have preformed very well. There are two organization name S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra. Hydra is criminal one inside the S.H.I.E.L.D.. A new character, the winter soldier (Sebastian Stan), introduced in this movie, makes it much more interesting. He was best friend of Captain America and now he is against the world by helping Hydra as some criminal scientists have changed his memory. Sometimes he is also called by 'Man with iron hand' as he has an machinery hand. He fights against the Captain and then there are some interesting action scenes. But Captain never wants to fight as he knows that he is still his friend and he tries to make him (winter soldier) remember the past life. So there are also some emotional scenes. In this movie, Captain America looks stronger and more refined soldier. The action and the fight scenes in this movie are just amazing. There are few twists; some of them are unexpected as the roll of Samuel L. Jackson(A S.H.I.E.L.D. agent) and some are just expected. This film deals with real life government issues such as how far should the government go to keep us safe. More the security we have; more we loose, both independence and security.
