0,24 February 2020,Leofwine_draca,6," Not bad, but too generic
","CAPTAIN MARVEL is the latest Marvel comics offering and the follow-up to AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR; inevitably it's a big step down from the success of that movie. This one goes down a much more predictable route, and it suffers hugely from having a main character who simply isn't very interesting; like Superman, her immortality and strength make her rather boring to see on screen. The film also suffers from having an unimposing villain, a crucial climactic scene openly copying RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, and generic action. On the plus side: there's a nice supporting turn from a funny and de-aged Samuel L. Jackson; the material on Earth is gently amusing, riffing on the buddy-buddy genre; there's a solid and major plot twist halfway through that really works; and Brie Larson is a decent actress. But they really need to think of something more involved next time instead of this generic amnesic hero stuff.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

",The screenplay is convoluted and confusing. The beginning feels like you walked into a movie half way. When things start to get explained it's too late. The humor is unfunny and childish. Samuel L Jackson singing and playing with the cat. The story is so confusing and silly - bouncing around between Earth and the space ships and shifting shapes.

","One major thing that people have said is that this film is great for ""Phase One"" of the MCU and that is absolutely true. The more recent films in this universe either raises the stakes for these heroes, adds more depth to them or does something unique to make it very worth watching.

","This is a very controversial Marvel film. Which seems to be a running trend with Disney films recently. The hype around this film seems to be very mixed, some want it to succeed and some want it to fail, and both sides seem to have these viewpoints due to various political reasons. There seems to be a lot of agendas involved. I do not have any stake in either side because I do not care about this kind of thing when it comes to film. I don't think it's fair to judge films from that perspective in a positive or negative way. In the same sense that I don't think it's fair to judge a film from a positive or negative perspective based on whether or not you like the actors involved. I don't care if films succeed or fail financially. Film is an art form to me and I just want to see films that are well-made by people who have a lot of passion for their craft.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

I thought the space battles were on par with Star Wars Episode 7 (better than guardians) and the story had lots of depth. It brought back memories and parallels with ""The Rocketeer"". Cookie cutter Marvel? Maybe. Origin stories always are ""cookie cutter"". This one was by far out of the norm though. Brie Larson was great! Funny but not cocky.

","I believe Screen Junkies put it best, this is a Phase One Movie in a Phase Three world. This is the first marvel film in a while that felt that the direction was faceless. Where the Russo's, Waititi, Gunn, Coogler, and even Reed (Among Others) shined Fleck and Boden's direction felt fairly faceless as the film comes off as just another Marvel outing. However it's not without it's charm. The visuals are stellar to look at, and the makeup on the fan-favorite Skrulls is a sight for sore eyes. The performances by Jackson and Mendelssohn are fantastic, but the movie wouldn't be anything without its leading lady. Brie Larson turns is a fine performance and it's great to see this character finally integrated into the MCU, however she's given very little to work with, and there's not much that truly distinguishes her yet, that's not the fault of Larson, just a writing and direction problem. The film is a fine spectacle, and a nice solo venture, but there's just not much originality that we've seen with the past slate of Marvel films.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

I'm giving it a 10 not because it is perfect, but I am always left 100% satisfied after viewing it. For once we have a female lead who is not a super model, overly sexualised woman, who the average person can identify with and root for. She's sassy .
Maybe those who have a great attachment to the MCU are harder judges because they measure it and expect consistency to all previous avenger movies, but I appreciate Captain Marvel as a stand alone movie.

","This is not quite the cultural touchstone that Black Panther was, but it's a better movie. Like Panther, it succeeds in teeing up the next Avengers movie, but it does so in a more direct and powerful way. The story of Carol Danvers' self-discovery unfolds unconventionally, but ultimately its convoluted elements coalesce and the newly mature character who emerges in the finale is probably the most badass figure in the MCU.

","Just got home from seeing this with my 13yr old daughter and we both CHEERED! Yes this movie follows the ""Marvel formula"" great action, decent comedic moments and the ""surprise"" MCU tie in.
Past that is a terrific story that is filled with laughter, awe, action, drama and yes there is a strong women's vibe. And there should be, CM is one of the most powerful characters in the MCU so anyone complaining that she's too powerful or that the fights are too easy should really pick up a comic.
Brie does a fantastic job at starting the film as a characteristic ""flyboy(girl)"" and morphs into a badass hero who clearly digs her unleashed power and is not afraid to show it. Shes someone who stands to be a beacon for all in the MCU. (I can't wait for the banter between her and the other heroes)

I like Brie Larson I think she is very good in the role.I was confused because I thought captain Marvel was a DC character so they renamed it Shazam. Which I didn't see but back in the 40s they had a serial called Capt Marvel aka shazam. Anyway this is a great MCU movie and the post credit scenes there is 2 by the way. Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury. Finally get to learn how he lost an eye. No spoilers but it's a lot of great special effects and Capt Marvel proves to be a superhero to be reckoned with as she battles aliens.

","Live Reaction / Review for Captain Marvel (2019): I've been avoiding watching this movie for many years because I was sure its bad, but today I will watch it and decide if it is actually decent or not, I hope it is. I don't know anything about the character so this is all new for me. If I understand correctly she is not exactly (fully) human but Kree. The Kree have an enemy race called ''Skrulls'', ok that's an interesting concept already. The Kree seem to be like very very technologically advanced compared to humans. The Skrulls are shapeshifters which sucks if you are their enemy. Imagine having an enemy who could look like anything they want. I read that this movie takes place in 1995? So that makes it one of the ''oldest'' MCU movies I think. That's a nice change. So by accident Carol ends up on earth, I like that. Samuel Jackson looks so young, nice vfx. The first half hour is very decent. Oh boy this movie just reminded me how old computers were, huge and very slow. I like her suit, its a simple design but works.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","Really, can't see what all the whining is about. This was a wonderful movie. Brie Larsen was cute, clever, funny, warm, friendly and kick ass awesome, all at the proper moments. One of the better Marvel Movies for me. Kept waiting for her to become the cold, heartless, threatening woman the viewer reviews are complaining about and it didn't happen. The whole cast, in fact, did an amazing job. If there was a weak moment for me, it was near the end of the movie after her potential powers have been revealed, and the writers, director, whoever tried the amateur gimmick of making her look vulnerable and ""at risk"" several times--pretty pathetic guys. Can't put the Genie back in the bottle once she's out. Much as I love Gal Gaidot in almost anything, I personally have to give this Captain Marvel a slight edge over Wonder Woman for the favorite female superhero movie (and tied with Alita B A). 8.5 (rounded to a 9) of 10 for the awesome Captain Marvel.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

There are several extremely likeable/admirable characters, including an adorable, strong, incredibly brave young girl. A few scenes elicited applause from the audience. Its values are wonderful: One could easily use various scenes and plot lines from this film to inspire several weeks of discussions for an ethics class. There was material on loyalty/betrayal, imperialism, patriotism/false patriotism, refugees, making peace, choosing to become your true self, interracial (at least!) harmony, family, friendship, and feminism-including a single throw-away ""touché"" line very close to the end, when Carol Danvers (aka Captain Marvel) addresses her erstwhile mentor, that earned applause and a few cheers from the audience.

","Reading all the negative reviews i wasn't going to go to the movies thinking I'd see it when came out on DVD. I ended up googling why the marvel movie ""bombed"" and then saw how the movie was trying to be boycotted and to be ruined through sites such as IMDB and Rotten tomato's 🍅. In fact a lot of these reviews were made before the movie came out. Interesting back story go google it if interested. Anyway upon reading that I decided to go watch the movie myself. And was engaged right from the start. Brie Larson(don't think I've watched her in anything before and if so she made no lasting impression on me) did a most excellent job. I am now a fan of Brie Larson and will search out other movies with her in it. It carried the same general (marvel universe)humour and jokes that makes you laugh with great action scenes that kept me engaged for the whole movie. I had to go to the bathroom from the beginning but because I didn't want to miss anything I waited until the end (longest pee ever....45 seconds at least....true story). Basically if your a fan of the marvel movies 🎥 pretty confident you'll enjoys this as much as the others. Go see it for yourself don't believe the bad ratings ""they're"" just trying to ruin the movie. Which goes to show you how easily we're influenced.

But it lacks a I-do-not-know-too-what in order to make it an excellent movie. In particular, the film is insufficiently pedagogic about the capabilities of the main character: in exactly 7 minutes (timed and verified at second viewing), we elliptically switch from a woman who does karate, manually warms a kettle and is able to send energy flows from her fists, without really knowing why or how, to a woman whose power seems limitless, on a scale we have never seen before in the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe.

","It's a good one. It tells the story that powers up engines which take the road to finale in Avengers: Endgame. And all those that have problems with leading female characters or super heroes (super hero fatigue, they call it, if I'm not mistaken) are missing the point and are misplaced. However, the film is also one thing more. It says a lot of things about the problems or self-perception. Namely, the problems of that how a person sees herself (or himself too) which here arise as a need to come out of the safe haven of everyday routine and see things from outside. What gives a freedom and a power to a person is a strength to change one's perspective about one's attitudes to others and to oneself, but also to realize that changing that perspective really changes everything. And gives a strength to know more and better oneself. Maybe this was not conveyed here in the same vain as in some more subtle art film but it's still a good example of it.
And yes, someday, those super heroes on film will have to be deconstructed, that's for sure. Which is also one of their qualities today and unpleasant, but also needy, consequence of tomorrow. And it will have to be done on film too, just like these ones, goodies, here.

115,10 March 2019,cjc0201,10," Reasons to NOT trash Captain Marvel as a film!
","I was honestly scared going to see Captain Marvel. She is one of my favorite superhero's and I was anxious to see what Marvel would do. I typically trust Marvel in all their decisions, however I cared that this movie did well. After reading reviews I am a bit confused. Did people watch the same movie as me?
I have a couple theories when it comes to the bad reviews.
1) People are trying to rate this like it is a normal movie. Captain Marvel is an origin story yes, however it transcends the cliche origin feel because of the way it is paced and edited together as a story. I admit that it is a bit weird. The movie doesn't really have a beginning middle and end because the nature of the film and I appreciated that. Captain Marvel assumes that you've seen the other MCU films and there is nothing wrong with that.
2. People are roasting Brie Larson as an actress. News flash: she's the only Avenger with an Oscar and just because you don't like the interpretation of a character doesn't make the actress bad. Her sassy charisma was super funny in my opinion and I appreciated the dry direct humor.
3. She's a woman. As a man who's enjoyed comics, movies and superheroes for a long time, I have seen people value male superhero or find particular interest in the males more than females. There is nothing wrong with this, however don't botch your rating simply because a female superhero doesn't quite fit your superhero desire. News flash: Captain Marvel is here to stay and quite frankly... will be the new leader of the MCU whether you liked her movie or not.
5. Spoiler alert! I think some people may have been mad about how the Skrulls were used. Kevin Feige released a statement that essentially read, ""skrulls can be good or bad just like humans and we'll probably see them again."" I love this explanation because it's true. Within a while species there is definitely potential for skrulls to be good or bad, however their plot in Captain Marvel was fresh and unexpected therefore I appreciated it. Plus the Skrulls added some unexpected humor!
6. I have seen a lot of people trash Carol's character development. Which once again I would relate back to the pacing and unique scenario of her not knowing parts of her own story. I felt like this fact was fine and considering it is her first movie of probably a lot, we're gonna see her really grow as a character and leader.
Overall, this was a great movie! Unique pacing that made it original to watch, fantastic character arcs and plot twists that still bring the same epitome of her original origin story!
Go watch it for yourself and form original opinions on this movie!",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","I'm not familiar with the character of Captain Marvel from the comics so coming in as a fresh face, I think they did a good job of developing her from start to finish. They even utilize a couple of story devices that I'm getting sick of like the protagonist suffering from amnesia. I feel like the Bourne movies made that a popular story element and its been repeated again and again. But in Captain Marvel, it allows us to learn about Ms. Danvers without her losing her resolve or requiring a huge exposition dump near the start of the movie. They integrate her flashbacks well and in an artistic manner to make them more palatable. I was interested in where Danvers had come from and while her overall arc may not break the mould, they gradually feed you little bits of her personality.

It has been a while since I genuinely enjoyed a Marvel movie. The last one was Logan, which I think we can all agree that was one of the best things produced by Marvel thus far.
I honestly did not think Wonder Woman was amazing (maybe a 7?). However, I am all for female empowerment. Captain Marvel was exactly that: female empowerment, but in the best way possible. It didn't have a political agenda at all. It did not promote a feminist view. I was worried Larson's acting would have been lacklustre due to the previews, and some of the lines in the movie were pretty iffy. I was also worried that she would be a total Mary-Sue, but I was completely wrong. There was no lame romance (even though I am hoping that Carol will end up sapphic. She has to follow in Ms. Blanchett's footsteps, right?) to take away from the action: aka Hulk and Widow.
Unlike Infinity War, this movie did not try to pack too many things in at once. I thought it told a complete story, which is what I look for in movies.

",I'm such a huge Marvel Fan both the comics and the cinema. I really don't understand all the reviews here. This generation is so dumb. Everyone goes to criticize like they're getting paid for it instead of just watching movies to enjoy them. I believe the actress chosen portrayed Captain Marvel well. She has a dry sense of humor but that doesn't make her flat. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I think it's worth adding to the marvel collection. People are so harsh and egotistical.

","This film had great special effects, dialogue and acting, I think those three things contribute to 90% of how good a film is, the other 10% is of course the relatively meaningless characters and story. This film had a lovely female actress playing the main character, this film truly did showcase the HUGE potential a female actress and female character can have on a film. I feel because of this film's success it is also one step closer to getting 50% screentime for women on average on all films and TV shows. The special effects left me swooning and they felt out of this world, overall I think it was the right thing for Disney to decide to change Captain Marvel's gender.

","Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) is trained up to use her new mysterious power to its full potential by the Kree after being found by them. When escaping from another alien group, she returns to Earth and discovers there's much more to her past and origins than initially thought. Marvel Studios have absolutely got it in the bag and have done for a long time; setting a high benchmark with Infinity War in 2018 and just flawlessly pulling off action spectacle and superhero integrity in everything they do. Admittedly through the first half of this one, I did find it strangely slow burning and not as engaging as previous episodes despite the spectacle and heart that was clearly being poured into it. Nevertheless, I started gradually feeling it more as it progressed and I came out of it feeling energetic and happy! I think the humour and soundtrack had a lot to do with my involvement in the film; it's hilarious at times (Goose the cat is one hell of a creation!) and the music references from Carol wearing Nine Inch Nails and Pixies shirts to the song choices being perfect, made for really brilliant sequences. The film has a lot of substance underneath its surface which I felt more in the final half which has moments of epic beauty and the realisation of Captain Marvel's beginnings is stunning. I'd like to watch the film again and discover more from the early stages too (other than the beautifully incredible opening paying tribute to Stan!) which I may have missed. Performance wise the ever reliable and amazing Brie Larson delivers totally and brings another fresh and exciting character to the MCU. This is Nick Fury's finest hour on screen also as Sam L Jackson is fantastic as always! Filmmaking duo Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (Half Nelson, It's Kind Of A Funny Story) inject a unique style into the film particularly in the Earth sequences which are full of laughs; it's a promising and enriching start to Carol Denvers' story",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","No, this movie is far from a 10/10, but I felt I needed to combat the unnecessarily negative and harsh reviews somehow. It is a classic marvel origin movie with great characters and a great soundtrack. Sure, the storyline was a tad weak but the storyline is not really what this movie is about. This movie is basically here to introduce us to Carol Danvers to lead onto endgame and future captain marvel movies/appearances. The movie starts off a bit slow but picks up and honestly lands itself into the list of my favourite marvel movies. To all the (mostly) males out there complaining about Brie Larson and the supposedly forced feminist agenda, please grow up. Not only does this movie introduce us to a new character in the mcu but also a new role model for young girls (and boys) everywhere. If you can manage to pull your head out from your asses you will see that it is more broadly about overcoming adversity such as young girls may face, but IT APPLIES TO ALL. Anyway, enough with my rant. Basically the movie isn't perfect, but it's crazy to expect it to be. Brie Larson and the entire cast do a brilliant job and the humour is spot on!!

I had hoped for the best, but expected to be let down. I am happy to say that I was presently surprised. While this is an origin story, I really liked the original way of introducing the character. Every member of the cast, right down to the cat, was outstanding. Larson and Jackson have great chemistry, leading to excellent humorous scenes. Also on that note, I have to admit that despite her personal issues, Larson knocked this out of the park. I don't think anyone else could have embodied Carol Danvers better.

179,5 November 2019,murrayspeer,9," Really excellent, but could be more visionary and more like '90s sci-fi
","The mid-90s in sci-fi and superhero movies were almost universally moody, slow-paced, and under lit. (Think Batman Forever, Independence Day, The Shadow, Stargate, The Crow, Strange Days, Species, Highlander III, etc.) I don't think Captain Marvel needed to copy that atmosphere entirely, but I sure would have liked more opportunities to feel like I was in a 90s movie. For example, if the action had taken place in the dark until Carol embraces her power which coincides with the first full sunrise of the movie, which could be teased as she moves toward that acceptance, it would have had much deeper significance. Overall it lacked the visionary feeling of the best recent Marvel Studios films.

","I won't comment on all the dreadful reviews, as everyone has its own taste.
But as a young woman who loves movies and superheroes, I loved it. Unlike what many on here said, I stepped out of the cinema with a sense of fulfillment and purpose, feeling inspired - Captain Marvel is a strong woman that can and should be an example for women to come. It might not be a faithful-to-the-comics movie (I wouldn't know as I haven't read them) - and on that note I would understand why many disliked it. But it's certainly VERY far from deserving a 1 out of 10 - disliking and irrationally hating are two different things. Taken as a movie of its own, as a single part of the MCU, I think it's great. It's funny and carries the 2hrs of lenght extremely well (time literally flies). It has an interesting and fairly captivating story and yes, it's not a masterpiece, but it's a goddamn good Marvel movie.
Most people do not understand the importance of seeing a female super hero not being sexualised for once, and saying ""I have nothing to prove to you"".

All of the super negative far right and far left ""reviewers"" who wanted the movie to be something it isn't, were proven wrong. It's not a man hating movie, far from it, it's an entertaining buddy picture, with a super powerful being and a somewhat cynical federal agent who's been riding a desk for too many years.

The worst Marvel movie would be the best in DCEU. And I don't hate DCEU, I feel sorry that they can get even close to Marvel, but to write so many hateful and wrong reviews is just sad. This one is definitely not the best MCU movie, but it is very good and just another hero introduction movie. You can see that Brie Larson didn't do anything similar in her career, but I find her like a really good choice for Captain Marvel. MCU needs to evolve and Captain Marvel is just that. I can't even imagine how much she evolved for all these years away from Earth, but she'll definitely be one of the main characters in Avengers End Game.

I for one did enjoy the whole plot and the intrigue I felt throughout the movie, and also the different origins that were revealed. I understand and agree with the opinion that the character of Carol Danvers is maybe just not that likeable. She comes off as a bit cocky, at times, and unidimensional.

Once Mar-Vell died in ""The Death of Captain Marvel"", the company struggled to fill the void and maintain the name.

Technically, it's a quality Marvel film. The CGI gets slightly over ambitious in the finale. However, there is absolutely no justification for the low ratings certain ""accounts"" are giving this film except as some kind of weird anti-feminist statement.

Action scenes on highest level, interesting plot and touching score - Marvel soundtracks continually improve and I think this one is great as well.
'Captain Marvel' is maybe the first movie in which you can actually see more from Nick Fury and understand his vital role for the MCU. Samuel L. Jackson does a decent job and he has a strong supporting role.
Well, I have to say something about the villains in this film - just expect something similar to what happened in 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2'.Nice plot twists, interesting investigation and awesome final fight. Don't expect a punching contest like in 'Civil War' or a clever solution like in 'Doctor Strange' - the final battle could be compared to a marvellous inspiration like in 'Guardians of the Galaxy'.

","Direction: Anna Boden & Ryan Fleck duo best known for their collaborations on Half Nelson , Sugar , It's Kind of a Funny Story and Mississippi Grind .However this time. they came together for the biggest mission of their life: Captain Marvel (The Most Powerful Avenger).
Performance: Room fame Brie Larson has played role which is larger than life. She was fighter, savior and super hero in single flick. Samuel L Jackson has done good job as a supporting role. Jude Law was impressive in small role. Ben Mendelsohn surprised the audience with his side.
Script: We must appreciate the efforts of director duo along with Geneva Robertson-Dworet, Nicole Perlman and Meg LeFauve. They have brilliantly linked many mystery in one go. e.g. How Marvel, Avengers words came into existence and why Fury has used Pager in infinity war. They have also mentioned the world at the era of 1990s with slow internet speed. Most unique thing was the way to give tribute to Stan Lee.
Dialogues: Conversion between Brie and Jackson's added fun in the script. Lashana and Brie 's conversation was emotional one.
Box-Office: After opening with 12.75 crores in India, it took another jump on day 2 as it has earned 13.75. It means that it will earn more on Sunday. It will be interesting watch whether it will cross 100 crores mark at Indian Box-Office.

I really liked the movie and I recommend anyone who follows/like MCU movies to watch it. If you're a fan even better.

","I really enjoyed watching this movie and I've seen quite a lot of superhero action movies over the past ten years and more.
Right at the beginning, there is a nice hommage to Stan Lee and there is also a cameo later.
The protagonist is a strong and sympathetic character and she is played really well by Brie Larson. Like most other superheroes her main choice of problem solving is by violent means but in between her actions also hints at the powerful message to never give up and stand up again (and again) no matter what odds are against you.
She is accompanied by some other strong characters too, i.e. she gets joined by Nick Fury. The setting is in 1995, so here we see a younger Nick Fury and also Agent Coulson, both already working for S.H.I.E.L.D yet in different positions than later. We also get a soundtrack full of hits of the Nineties, like Nirvana, Garbage, TLC and others. The original soundtrack was not overwhelming yet okay. If you see the movie, wait until the end to see two short extra scenes, one of them hinting at ""Marvel's The Avengers: Endgame""",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","At this point in the MCU it is rather hard to find surprises. Likewise, origin stories are often very rote and formulaic. That is somewhat true in this film but the decision to set the film in the 90's rather helps. Likewise, the decision to the make the film sort of a origin story for Fury was a good idea. The 90's nostalgia coupled with seeing how the pieces of the MCU fit into this film really liven up this story. I was fond of how the various reveals subverted the expectations. With an antagonist that can be anyone it was great to see how many characters weren't what they initially seemed. Overall, the story is a solid origin tale that fits in with Iron Man, Dr. Strange, the 1st Captain America etc. And hold its own. There are few choice barbs at sexism that are great and adds to the female empowerment of the film in a tasteful way.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

288,28 March 2020,fernandoschiavi,7," The film follows the late Marvel formula and does not take chances, does not innovate and does not dare, but delivers a fun, nostalgic result!
","About to end its phase 3 with an ""Ultimatum"", one of the most awaited films of the last decades, Marvel still finds time to introduce new and important characters in its shared universe. In the comics, Carol Danvers, Captain Marvel, debuted in the Silver Age of American comics. The character was featured in a solo series in the late 1970s, before associating with the superhero teams, The Avengers and X-Men, the character was created by screenwriter Roy Thomas and designer Gene Colan. Danvers first appeared as an officer in the United States Air Force and a colleague of superhero kree Mar-Vell in Marvel Super-Heroes # 13 (March 1968). In recent times, Danvers has been labeled ""Marvel's greatest heroine"" and ""possibly"" most powerful Marvel Avengers member. ""
In theaters, ""Captain Marvel"", in addition to being the first Marvel film starring a heroine, is the bridge between ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and the long-awaited ""Avengers: Ultimatum"". Directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, and written by Geneva Robertson-Dworet, it stars Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, Lashanna Lynch, Djimon Hounsou, Lee Pace, Mckenna Grace, Clark Gregg and Jude Law. takes us takes us to before all the other MCU features (except for Captain America: The First Avenger). In 1995, the story follows Danvers when she becomes Captain Marvel after Earth is caught in the center of a galactic conflict between two alien worlds, borrowing elements from screenplay writer Roy Kree-Skrull (1971). Thomas.
For starters, the publisher's homage to his legendary comic artist Stan Lee stands out, putting him in the place of the characters he created in the opening animation of Marvel Studios. Lee passed away in late 2018 and, before that, he even recorded his famous participation in the film, appearing in the scene where the heroine hunts a Skrull in the subway.
Exploring flashes of the past very well, the heroine tries to discover more about her own past, as well as understand and master her powers. Finally, the heroine manages to show a more human facet to the public through the partnership with Nick Fury that generates several situations of comedy that gives lightness to the war by showing it through Fury's still innocent eyes, and also with Maria Rambeau (Lashanna Lynch), which is the heroine's great connection to her past. It is in Maria's memories the memory of facing prejudices as pilots and in the support for the creation of little Monica Rambeau (Akira Akbar). But there are other characters who are doing very well and steal all the scenes they participate in: Talos (Ben Mendelsohn) and the cat Goose. Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) and Dr. Wendy Lawson / Supreme Intelligence (Annette Bening) are good assistants.
Because it is a film that takes place decades ago, it is curious to see several of the characters that we get used to accompany, in another moment of life. Ronan the Accuser, who first appeared as the great villain of Guardians of the Galaxy and a lackey for Thanos, appears as the leader of an elite Kree force, the Accusers; Korath is just a Kree soldier; Agent Coulson appears as a young and promising agent and the main highlight is Nick Fury. At the time, he was an agent for S.H.I.E.L.D. who, after years as a spy, worked outside the field looking for ways to protect the Earth. He is still inexperienced and had no knowledge of intergalactic issues, let alone superpowered beings. Jackson and Gregg - who, among others, reprise their roles in previous MCU films - were digitally rejuvenated in post-production to reflect the setting of the film in the 90s. And the result couldn't be better: they are of an absurd quality, bordering on the perfection.
One of the main aspects of the feature is the infinity of references not only in relation to the stories of the publisher's comics, but also in the pop culture of the 80s and 90s, where the story predominantly takes place. After escaping the Skrulls, Carol Danvers falls to Earth inside a Blockbuster video store. As the feature takes place in the 1990s, it is possible to see references to classics such as Hook: The Return of the Captain Hook (1991), Babe, the Rough Piggy (1995), True Lies (1994), in addition to The Elected: Where the Future Begins (1983). The musical references are also present, with several references of bands from the 80's and early 90's. She appears with a Guns N 'Roses T-shirt - and finds a ticket to the group's concert, a Bush poster appears when she is on the pay phone, Nine Inch Nails, Heart t-shirts appear, a Smashing Pumpkins poster and even a reference to grunge in the heroine's civilian outfits.
Another reference is Captain Marvel's cat, which in the comics is called Chewie in a reference to Star Wars. In cinema, however, Marvel chose to call him Goose, a direct reference to Anthony Edwards' character in Top Gun: Untamed Aces. It is not, however, a conventional feline. Goose arrived on Earth with Mar-Vell and is an alien of the Flerken race, with internal tentacles and the ability to swallow objects as powerful as the Tesseract. In comics, the breed also has the ability to harbor dimensions within itself, being able to teleport from place to place, in addition to laying numerous eggs. In the film, aware of the threat of Flerken, the Kree gag the creature, in a moment inspired directly by the comics. The film also reveals how Nick Fury lost his eye - a scratch from Goose, and how theories emerged about how he came to use his famous eye patch, with Fury insisting on feeding the aura of mystery around the wound. There is also the fact that Fury was inspired by Danvers to propose to S.H.I.E.L.D. recruiting exceptional individuals to defend the Earth together from unconventional threats, and when he discovers that Danvers was codenamed ""Avenger"" in the Air Force, he names this protocol ""Avengers Initiative"".
Although the film highlights the friend Maria Rambeau, we must pay attention to her daughter. Monica Rambeau in the comics is one of the most powerful heroines in the Marvel Universe, having even been the first woman to use the name Captain Marvel. In 1982, at Amazing Spider-Man Annual # 16, Marvel introduced Monica Rambeau at the hands of Roger Stern and John Romita Jr. as a New Orleans police officer who has the power to transform into any form of energy. As Captain Marvel, she was a member of the Avengers and even led the team. Then he adopted the name Photon (which in the film appears as Maria's nickname in the air force, as shown in the photo above), Pulsar and currently serves as Spectrum. As the film takes place in the 90s, Mônica is around 30 years old in the present line of the MCU.
However, the film is not just a nostalgic trip and it has different points. Perhaps due to their lack of experience in running large blockbusters, the duo of directors are unable to shoot action scenes that look spectacular. The prevalence of more closed plans and not so imposing scenarios, fail to give the scenes greater proportions as they should. The feeling is that in the hands of another director, the scenes could be reimagined in the way that worked best on the big screen. In addition to not being grandiose, the scenes are scarce, being almost all restricted to the final act of the story, and were also not helped in many moments by the visual effects team. In several scenes, it is possible to notice the use of CGI in the composition of scenarios, giving an air of artificiality, especially in the final stretch when the heroine fights aerial fights with her powers developed.
The rhythm of the film is a problem with the plot starting relatively at a slower pace, taking time to explain the central conflict - deeper than it appears - and, of course, the protagonist's role in this story. So, gradually, Captain Marvel gains a more intense cadence and it is in her arrival on Earth that the film actually begins to take a more defined form. There is also the issue of the Skrull-Kree war, which is summed up in a very simplistic and incoherent way. We have a little war. In the film, everything is very predictable. From the beginning, one feels that nothing is as it seems, and the real villains can be identified with a mere guessing exercise. However, it is the lack of personality of the antagonists, generic in their plans and worldview, that damage the plot more deeply. Seeing this weak antagonism after figures like Killmonger and especially Thanos is, to say the least, something that lowers the experience to a B or C series within this recent crop.
Long before she was Captain Marvel, Carol was a fearless girl finding her place in a world of men. As a human, she has flaws, but whenever she fell, she got up, tried herself and got everything she wanted. A child, a teenager, a young adult. The transformation into Kree would be the starting point for the character, if her entire past no longer assumed a hero's journey. The feminist subtext, although well implemented, does not reach the depth that racial and cultural themes gained in the film of the hero of Wakanda. And you don't even have to reach it. Issues can be raised for discussion without becoming flags blindly defended by a particular group. Overall, the film follows the late Marvel formula and does not take chances, does not innovate and does not dare, but delivers a fun, nostalgic result and a character that will certainly be one of the leaders of The Avengers in the next films!",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

(Btw I am a pure conservative) The media blew this movie way out of proportion about the feminist message. Yes of course there were very subtle hints of it but it's not revolutionary as a feminist piece of art (just because it's has a female lead doesn't make it a feminist legend) The movie start to finish kept me on edge with great story telling and plot twists. Another's thing people are complaing about is braie larson's acting they say she is too bland, but thats the point! HER CHARACTER IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE EMOTIONAL! She was actually playing her part perfect. Her character is very reserved and withdrawn to strangers and gradually you see her develop. Samuel L. Jackson was also great ( the secod act of the movie feels like a buddy-cop movie) To end off as the move came to a close the entire theater gave a standing ovation!

In the second however, it exceeded my expectations entirely. The true beauty of this film is that it's a film made with a feminist agenda by someone who doesn't actually seem to hate men. It's about empowering women by virtue of their own ability; showing what they can achieve simply by themselves, not by patronising them with special treatment.
It also succeeds in showcasing a female superhero without feeling the need to make her a sex symbol in a short skirt/using gratuitous shots of her bottom. Brie Larson looks great throughout, but at no point did I ever feel that was a focus.
Full disclosure - I am a man. If I ever have a daughter, I want films like this to inspire her.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019
312,30 March 2020,kermitkid,8," Needed Better Trailer Editing
","This is a perfect example of horrible marketing for a good movie. I wasn't too impressed with the trailers. They were kind of bland. I went into this with my expectations checked at the door, and this movie was above average. It wasn't as boring and uninteresting as the trailers led me to believe, but it still has faults. For an MCU movie, it's average, and for a movie it's above average. The main problem was it tried to hard to be another 'Guardians of the Galaxy' movie, but without the risks. ""Guardians"" was a gamble. (A movie about a talking raccoon and a tree?! Marvel has lost their minds!). It tries to capture the wonder of a sci-fi movie, but plays it too safe. There were many factors that I felt didn't go as far as they could have. The plot is pretty paint-by-numbers as well. This movie 'borrows' too much from other films. It didn't feel enough like it's own thing. There were some amusing moments, and one in particular that got a huge laugh out of me, but the film played it too safe. The CGI is pretty impressive. I couldn't tell that the aliens in the movie were CGI. However, when there are scenes of characters flying, it definitely looks CGI, and cheap CGI at that. (Think ""video game trailer."") Larson's acting is not as wooden as the trailers would lead you to believe (most of the time anyway), nor is the character of Captain Marvel as narcissistic and rude as the trailers made her seem. She's nowhere close to my favorite MCU character, but I wouldn't mind seeing her return. I don't know what most of Hollywood has against Ben Mendelssohn's natural accent. Mendelssohn is a terrific actor, but in movies like ""Ready Player One"" and this one where they make him do an American accent, it sounds fake, and is distracting. And no, this movie is not a 2 hour lecture on feminism. Contrary to the marketing, Captain Marvel doesn't put down the male characters (at least not unprovoked.) This movie actually can be enjoyed by anyone. Marvel needs to re-evaluate their marketing team.

331,9 March 2019,stevendbeard,8," Plenty Of Action To Go Around
","I saw ""Captain Marvel"", starring Brie Larson-Kong:Skull Island, 21 Jump Street_2012; Samuel L. Jackson-Glass, Kong:Skull Island; Ben Mendelsohn-Robin Hood_2018, The Dark Knight Rises; Jude Law-Fantastic Beasts:The Crimes of Grindelwald, Spy and Annette Bening-Rules Don't Apply, Open Range.
This movie is based on the Marvel comic book character, not the original Captain Marvel that is now being published by DC comics-he goes by the name of Shazam ever since they lost the name rites to Marvel's character, but that's another story. Brie plays Carol Danvers, aka Captain Marvel. The movie is set in 1995 and you learn through flashbacks and memories her origin story. Samuel is Nick Fury and he-as well as another actor-is de_aged digitally so that he looks younger and he has both of his eyes. You do learn what happened that made him wear the eye patch-at least according to the MCU, aka Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it's not the same as in the original comics. Story wise, there is a big galactic war going on between two alien races called the Kree and the Skrulls. Jude is the Kree soldier that trained Brie and Ben is the leader of the Skrulls, a shape_shifting race. Annette plays the Supreme Intelligence, an A.I. that gives the Kree their marching orders. Both races are competing to find a certain item of power and it just so happens to be hidden on Earth, so there is plenty of action to go around. I remember hearing some music by No Doubt and Nirvana among some others. The opening Marvel Studios logo-the one that usually shows lots of different Marvel characters-is a little different, focusing on only one person, and it is not Captain Marvel. Stan Lee has his usual brief cameo-filmed before he died in 2018-and I've heard he will have his last one in the Avengers End Game. There are two scenes as the end credits start; one is right after the credits start, and it includes several Avengers and it is connected to the Infinity War and the other one is at the very end and it is comical, involving a character named Goose.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci fi violence & action and some mild language and has a running time of 2 hours & 4 minutes.
It was a little confusing at times, because of the flashbacks and memory scenes but it did make sense in the end.
Overall, I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu_Ray.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","Captain Marvel was excellent. Saw it last night at the opening screening with a packed house of cheering fans and can't wait to go back and see it again. It fits perfectly in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, setting us up nicely for Endgame next month. We learn a bit more about Fury, Samuel L Jackson clearly had a great time portraying this character at an earlier point in history. Brie Larson gives a superb performance as a woman struggling to find out who she is and what her role should be in the universe. The writers were clearly aware of the kind of backlash they would get from the fragile male egos who would not be able to bear a movie with a female superhero, and inserted a few inside jokes allowing Carol Danvers to show them exactly what women ( and men who aren't idiots) really think of their opinions.
It's not Civil War, but it wasn't intended to be, it's more akin to Ant Man, or Dr Strange, giving us the background necessary for Captain Marvel to be a part of Endgame without a lot of exposition.

","After a nice acknowledgement of the late Stan Lee (and all his cameos throughout the Marvel films) in the MARVEL opening logo and a special tribute to him, the film begins with us introduced to Brie Larson's Carol Danvers (currently going by the name Vers), who has a blue nosebleed, has clearly been in a fight and/or accident, and as a result is suffering fragmented memories of her previous life. First thing you'll have to adapt to with this film is its non-linear storytelling. We shift between past and present, which gives you an idea of just how confused Carol must be feeling. She's a Kree, which are 'noble warrior heroes' who fight against green aliens called Skulls. She's part of a team led by Yon-Rogg (Jude Law).

Yes she appears super powerful and that nothing and no-one could touch her by the end of the film but I believe the film makers have done this deliberately in the run up to Endgame were I have no doubt during which she'll be knocked down a peg or two being overconfident.

359,10 March 2019,TheHonestCritic,8," Was this movie worth the hype? Or is the feminist controversy true? Check out my review below to find out!
","I just saw the movie: ""Captain Marvel"" (2019), written and directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck. Starring Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, and more! All I can say is; this movie took me by surprise. I went in ready to hate this movie and be bored with it, but I thought it was great! Ignore the haters and feminist comments you hear all over the internet, all of that is totally unnecessary. Just because the lead superhero in a movie is a woman does not mean the film can't be good. Any way, back to the review. This movie was a joy from beginning to end! The story may have been just another superhero origin story, but it was told in a fresh and unique way. Although, the first ten minutes kind of dragged, the rest of the story was excellent. The acting was also great. However, the one actor I was skeptical about was Brie Larson. I was worried that she might be too dull and wooden. But, she put on a great performance, as did the rest of the cast! She is perfect for the Captain Marvel character. The sets/locations were good, atmosphere in a film is one of the biggest factors. Do I even need to praise the special effects? Most special effects in modern movies and TV shows are usually a given. All of the special effects in this film were great, especially the de-aging effect for actors Samuel L. Jackson, and Clark Gregg. They really did look 20 years younger! That was really well done, and I was really impressed with the result. Props to the editing team! Probably the only flaw in this film is the soundtrack, it is good for the most part. However, it bounces all over the place, for example: it doesn't stick to any particular tone during the movie. Granted, I do love 1990's music, but the layout of the film score just seemed a little jumbled. Now a soundtrack like that can work when in the proper movie, but it doesn't work here. This was a very fun and exciting film, and I can't wait to see it again! It may not be as excellent as some of the other Marvel movies, and it's definitely not nearly as mind-blowing as ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"", or ""Avengers: Infinity War"". But still, it's certainly worth watching in theaters, and buying on DVD. I give this film a 4 out of 5 star rating, which equates to 8 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Captain Marvel"" yet, you should go check it out. I hope you enjoyed my review for this movie!",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

Guys angry that she's so powerful. That's the funniest thing I've ever heard. Grow up, white dudes lmao.
This orgin story of new cap and fury is wonderful. With a Truman show meets Bourne identity beginning and a badass super powerful ending.
Also, to the people asking WHY she is so powerful...you are obviously not a marvel fan.....I won't spoil it but she gets her powers from an actual INFINITY STONE!
I know she dissed some white dudes but this movie is not feminist propaganda (shouldn't offend even if it was LDEers) it's about being a human and always getting back up. Finding yourself.

","This is only my opinion and many may disagree, but I actually liked a movie a lot, even though it is a little bit childish (but not too much, so it's not really a bad thing).
This is a movie about stubborn, headstrong, tenacious woman, who was (un)lucky enough to be at the right place at the right time which made her one of the most powerful beings in the universe. She doesn't know that at first and that is story, her rediscovering herself after the change. And it was very nice. The kid in me is screeming from happiness cause that's how a dream of becaoming a superpowerful superhero really looks like.
This certainly is not the best MCU movie, but it is good and it's worth watching, and if you forget the whole feminist-political context people have created (without any reason honestly) you will enjoy it.

","I don't get with all this bad review, I think the movie quite decent, and have some memorable moments.
I understand that the producer and the director try to build a story about how Carol Denvers become Captain Marvel, and they try to make it as simple as they can be, because this film also aimed to young children.
The film peaked at it's time, it's not all this fancy full action between heroes and villains like any other superheroes movies. Instead they create moments to make the relationship between Danvers and Fury believable, and how Danvers will do anything to help Fury (in the connection to Avengers End Game).
I think the viewers or critics being unfair to this film. They held expectation too high and compare it to the Avengers movies. It's not fair because in Avengers they already have a well known and loved heroes so they can go big with all the action and super villain. Here, Captain Marvel is a new hero to the eyes of public (not comic geeks), so they try to create a character that relate to young kids and women specially.

The notion that Capt.M. is over-powered is odd. I mean, Thanos has the Infinity Gauntlet. Is that supposed to be weaker than Carol? What we see from Captain Marvel is someone who IS HUMAN and has a lot of heart. Someone who takes a beating and keeps getting up.
This movie is about relationships and truth. You get to see a Stan Lee cameo, learn a lot more about Nic Fury/ SHIELD/ and the Avengers initiative. You get to become familiar with Goose the cat(?) and the tesseract..that is worth the ticket price right there.
Best of all you see what a total badarse Captain Marvel is. That was a movie that could have stood alone on it's own merit.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

They introduce a superhero character and so generally spend more time in developing the lead than a movie otherwise would. This sometimes leaves a less developed good guy-bad guy story line in the movie making it feel almost like an after thought, and the most banal way possible to showcase the superhero's powers and budding confidence.

431,8 November 2019,andrewmerritt-31652,7," Why all the hate??
","Captain Marvel is a superhero film and is also the twenty first film in the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) franchise. Captain Marvel stars Brie Larson, Samuel L Jackson, Jude Law, and Ben Mendelsohn. Captain Marvel revolves around a Kree warrior named Carol Danvers who has recurring memories of her past while at the same time getting caught in the middle of a war between the Kree and the Skrulls. Now I think I'm going to start this review by addressing the elephant in the room and that is Brie Larson. Brie Larson came under fire for making a racist remark about how this movie was made to target female audiences and not white male audiences. I may be paraphrasing that, but you could look up articles and watch videos about that because I don't want to get into all the details. And after that remark all the Internet trolls were mad and some of them have this fantasy that Brie Larson took the role of Captain Marvel because she's a strong female superhero who is the only superhero that could destroy Thanos. They also said that Brie Larson was miscast because she only had one emotion and that we were supposed to look up to her as a symbol. And my response to all this statement is is that its no the best, but it could've been a lot worse. I know nothing about Captain Marvel, nor do I intend to go out and immediately buy a Captain Marvel comic book. Not once during the whole movie did I feel that Brie Larson ruined Captain Marvel for me or that she seemed uninterested in taking the role. She portrayed the character really well and maybe it was do to the fact that there were so many backlash against her being Captain Marvel, that she was able to tap into that character. The movie offers great special effects, characters, and an emotional ride where I almost actually cried. And also die-hard Marvel fans are still going to see this film because they don't care about all that information I just mentioned. And its still going to make trillions of dollars whether it sucks or not. So overall, while Captain Marvel may not be the best superhero movie out there, its definitely not the worse we've seen that's it's worth the price of a ticket whether you're a comic book fan or not.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

I never go to a movie expecting too much so that I have a chance to enjoy it - especially a superhero movie. Captain Marvel was refreshing for me because it wasn't the uppity superhero personna. Brie's part on here came across as a normal girl-next-door type. How refreshing! I like Samuel Jackson's Fury and the Skrull character who did a great job as well. There were many humorous moments which lightened the whole thing. That's what I call entertainment. Kinda funny that her being a fighter pilot she had fallen thru the roof of the Blockbuster store and ended up pick up and looking at ""The Right Stuff"" movie.

446,10 June 2019,danbranan,8," OK, listen up all you people rating this as 1-star
","You've either got an axe to grind that has nothing to do with the film itself, or you're woefully ignorant of film-making and film history. Either way, you need to face some facts.
First - just so you know where I'm coming from I am a 53-year old, retired, disabled, Air Force officer, and I'm a guy. I'm also a big Marvel comics and film fan and I thoroughly enjoyed Captain Marvel. Is it a perfect film? Absolutely not (more on that later), but is it a 1-star film, or even a 5-star film? No way! ""Ishtar"" is a 1-star film. ""Plan Nine from Outer Space"" (or any other Ed Wood Jr. production) is a 1-star film. Captain Marvel is a 7-star film at worst and I've erred on the high side to help make up for all these ridiculous 1-star ratings. I'll address the main complaints that people have given for these low ratings and then I'll cover what I think really are the weak points of the film.
""The acting is terrible!"" Come on now, if you think this is terrible acting, you've never seen actual terrible acting. I know this is subjective, but there are some reference marks we can probably all agree on. Go to your average high school play - that's terrible acting. Watch any Ed Wood Jr. film - that's horrible acting. But Captain Marvel has reasonably good acting that fits the characters quite well, in my opinion. Is Vers stiff and wooden at first? Of course she is. She's been abducted by aliens and brainwashed and told consistently to squelch her emotions. Brie Larson captures this well, IMO. Later on in the film, she loosens up and has several emotional moments that I thought were quite effectively portrayed - especially in her interactions with the Rambeau family.
""She's not humble!"" Right - this is a standard to which we hold super heroes now? ""(fill in the blank) would be such a great super hero if he was just more humble,"" said nobody, ever, about any male super hero character. Is Thor humble? Is Iron Man\Tony Stark humble? Is Hulk humble? There are a few humble A-list male super heroes, but they're the exception rather than the rule: Captain America, Dr. Strange, Spider Man and, um... That's all I can think of. The point is, there are several notably non-humble male super heroes and this has never been a problem for anyone that I'm aware of. Let's think about this character for a minute and see if this non-humble attitude is appropriate or not: Carol Danvers is a USAF Academy cadet, which is one of the most selective schools in the nation (I taught chemistry there for 10 years, so I know what I'm talking about), and EVERYONE knows this (factors into the next point). Cadets are fed a constant diet of ""you're the best of the best"", and with good reason. These people are the top of their class, straight-A students, often national-class (if not world-class) athletes, socially active in things like Civil Air Patrol, Search and Rescue and other public services. If they weren't, they would never be one of the 1000 per year students who are selected to attend USAFA. Then, she becomes a test pilot. This means she was among the top 1% of all the pilots in the Air Force in terms of capability and skill. And not just any test pilot, but a pilot for a highly classified program, which puts her in an even higher class of excellence. Now, you can't go through that kind of selection process and training without being, regardless of gender, kind of a jerk. (Q: What happens when you give a fighter pilot Viagra? A: He gets taller.) And I say this with all due respect to my pilot friends. But, like Brie Larson portrays her, and like most of the pilots I've known, Carol Danvers isn't an a-hole, but a humorous, sarcastic, irreverent and highly educated and capable person. So, IMO, it is entirely appropriate for Carol Danvers to be a relatively emotionless, non-humble person at the start of the film. Later, she's brainwashed to believe that she's a force for good in the Universe, and even later, she discovers that she's one of the most powerful beings in the universe. Hmm, does that call for humility? Maybe - but how many people with that background would be humble, at least initially?
""There's no character\plot development!"" Umm, if you don't see character and plot development then you must need a film that has all the subtlety of a jackhammer on the forehead. I thought the character development was told remarkably efficiently through the effective use of flashbacks. If you're paying attention, you easily pick up on Carol's rough childhood, her grit and determination, her friendship with Maria, her talent and capability as a pilot, etc. What more do you want? I mean, everyone I've ever talked to about the USAF Academy instantly knows that the students there are the top high school graduates in the country, even if they know nothing else about the school. That alone tells you a tremendous amount about the character, much less all the vignettes of her getting knocked down and getting back up again. I found this to be enjoyable and inspiring. And the plot? Even though it was a bit predictable, I thought they did a fine job of showing the hypocrisy of the Kree and the predicament of the desperate Skrulls (helped along by some fantastic acting by Ben Mendelsohn.
""She doesn't fight a Big-Bad!"" Uhhh, so what? She fights off an invading fleet of Accuser warships. She stands up to her brainwashing captors and helps the people she had been trained to think of as enemies. Are you so unimaginative and dead inside that you need some major monster battle to tell you when the climax of the film has arrived?
Last one: ""It's a feminist attack on (white) manhood!"" If you think it's an attack on white males, then you need to pull your head out of your hidden agenda. The Kree (who are the closest things to ""bad guys"" are an amazingly diverse group in the film, containing males, females, and several different ethnic groups (so does Kree = United States? Hmmm...) so when their hypocrisy is revealed, how can you think it's a direct slap at white males, unless you are blinded by your own prejudices? And at least two major ""good guy"" characters are either actually white males (Phil Coulson) or prefer to be seen as a blue-eyed white male (Talos). Bottom line: If you think this film is an attack on manhood, then you're pretty insecure in your manhood.
What are my complaints about the film? I do have a few:

","This film was a very fun blockbuster action film and I don't not think it's nearly as bad as critics have been saying. First of all Brie Larson gives a fun and charismatic performance, I thought she could've done a bit more with the character but her performance and her respect for her comic self was fantastic. The CGI was phenomenal especially for the de-aging of Nick Fury and Phil Coulson, it genuinely looked real and flawless. The style is fun and light hearted which is exactly what I think this film should have gone for and it makes for some very amusing scenes. The movie does have problems, the second act was nowhere near as fun or entertaining as the first and third and it sort of dragged until the third act picked back up, also I think some of the action (while it was on the whole great) was at points too close up and too quick cut and I would have preferred more spacing and length in the shots, however I'm not going to discredit the opening action scene as it was very entertaining and that's what this film is in a nutshell, typical Marvel entertainment.

The film is set in the 90s and the vfx work to make Sam Jackson look younger are truly terrific.

","Controversial or not, I did not like this movie. That's not to say I hated this movie, I just felt an extreme amount of apathy, which to my understanding is a filmmakers worst fear. When you make a movie, you want a reaction out of the audience, whether that be good or bad. I just can't see myself ever revisiting this confusing, convoluted, and bland sci-fi film. I actually like Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck a lot too. I haven't seen 'Sugar' yet, but I like 'It's Kind of a Funny Story' and love 'Mississippi Grind'. All that aside, I don't believe this film is directed or written well at all. Dialogue comes off as disingenuous, out of place, and unearned. The humor hits a few times but nowhere near the level you come to expect with Marvel films. And the performances are just okay...? As much as I love Brie Larson, and I think she's one of the greatest actresses of this new generation, she may not have been the best fit. I won't say miscast, I'll save that for after Endgame in April, but something just didn't sit right with her portrayal. The movie also attempts to connect to other Marvel films in a less than gratifying way. The fact that Nick Fury, who is supposed to be extremely bada**, gets his eye cut out by a small scratch from a flipping cat? Are you serious? And Fury gets the Avengers name from an old picture of Carol Danvers? Please. That's some Han Solo getting his name in Solo/Lex Luthor in BVS naming the JL level of stupidity. But putting aside those few major gripes, there's not a lot to hate or love about this one. Chalk it up to a huge swing and a miss for Marvel.

A throwback that's not limited to a couple of jokes and some hit songs: lighting, camera angles, color schemes, a score that hits 90s action movie riffs during the earthbound sections. And even co-stars Samual L. Jackson, also de-aged back to the 90s. It's an interesting creative choice for a 2019 blockbuster.

","I went to see the movie with very mixed feelings. MCU has produced some excellent movies and a bunch that come from the other end of the scale. After seeing the trailers I was most afraid that Captain Marvel would fall into the latter category. Thankfully I was wrong.
To me the movie and especially Brie Larson were able to produce a coherent and a very understatedly funny coming of age -story. Sometimes it felt that the screen writer came from a British school of comedy writers with the subtle and very quick jokes that had considerably more depth than met the eye. Naturally, the movie could have gone deeper to the motivational aspects of the main characters, especially Nick Fury whose backstory this was as strongly as Captain Marvel's. Still, for me the psychological aspects of change were handled much more convincingly than in most MCU stories.
The action did not take the center stage which, for me, is also positive. The fight scenes were choreographed quite messily and I still cannot understand, why the ultimately strong character has to take few hits even after it has been proved that she is in different scale with the competitors.
The best part, IMO, was the end of the last fight between Captain Marvel and Yon-Rogg. I think that every other major player in the MCU would have needed to prove herself as ordered. It would have been interesting to have Carol Dancers discussing emancipation with Darlene Sweet from the Bad Times at El Royale.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019
492,16 March 2019,matthewssilverhammer,4," The Worst MCU Movie Yet...and NOT Because of the Snowflake MRA Reasons
","With Captain Marvel, Marvel Studios has (finally!) placed their first female-fronted outing in the hands of one of their oldest and most enduring characters, and one that is every bit as bold and fun as she ever was. Unfortunately, the movie never lives up to the character's name. Many of the tried-and-true Marvel ingredients are here (hero's journey, irreverent humor, bright colors, Nick Fury), but with a general lack of purpose beyond bluntly declaring the empowerment of women (perhaps a few years too late?) and whetting our appetite until Endgame.
When an alien soldier named Vers crash lands in 1990s America, she is accompanied by Nick Fury and SHIELD in order to stop an intergalactic disaster. Other than the 1990s part, this should feel like extremely familiar territory. This movie reeks of Thor and Guardians of the Galaxy influences, only without the brazen originality or import. Even where other lesser Marvel films get by on the charm and intrigue of their hero, Larson falters. Not that it's really the Oscar-winning actress's fault. The movie is constantly telling us how ""funny"", ""brash"", and ""emotional"" she is, but never convincingly shows us.
A common critique of these MCU films is that they are less movies and more episodes of an expensive TV series, one that has throwaway episodes that only serve as minor bridges between the ""important"" entries. Maybe I was just too blinded by fan-boy-dom before now, but this was the first time I truly felt that. In that sense, you'll probably wanna see this movie to stay up on what's to come with this franchise.

493,21 May 2019,nanothestrange,8," An overall good movie, but a pretty plain marvel movie. Carol needs more characterization.
","I enjoyed the movie for the most part, The storyline was good and relatively clear, character's motivations made sense, effect were good, pacing was decent and a surprisingly good supporting cast. the only gripe i have with the plot was how some scenes seemed very forced or unnatural. i understand the female justice theme had to be a part of the movie, but a lot of scenes just seemed too on the nose. they came off as random and very hamfisted and didnt flow into the movie in a witty or natural way. it seemed like they cared too much about trying to make the movie relevant so it could be noticed and not enough about telling a cohesive story with clear character arcs. The movie is an overall enjoyable watch and as a movie it was pretty good. as a marvel movie however, it lacked in some pretty substancial ways. for starters, Brie Larson's performance wasn't terrible, but it was very clear that either she or the director weren't sure what direction to take the character in. at points she seems like she's arrogant and serious, others she's jovial and sarcastic, and her reactions to things seem somewhat unnatural. one minute she's angry, the next she's crying, the next she doesnt care and its just very jarring. she doesn't really feel like a real person like all the other MCU characters do. Maybe brie larson was trying to put too much of herself in the character instead of trying to make the character dynamic and realistic. either way theres this general ambiguity that falls over the character's actions, abilities and personality. the limitations of her strength seems pretty inconsistent from scene to scene. overall it seems like the storyline and the character were written by completely different writing teams. the story was solid but Carol herself just lacks direction as a character, any unique or interesting personality traits that help her stand out as a character and just doesnt act the way a normal person does. it seems to me like they didnt really know much about captain marvel as a character and didnt really understand how she works in general. I had been very much looing forward to the film and was only mildly disappointed walking out. i was really hoping she would be an incredibly badass and perfect front runner for the next phase of the MCU but i believe she needs more work.

As a person who hasn't read the comics, I wouldn't know, but the movie did a great job!! So please, review this as a movie and don't spoil everything with the truly bad context of your reviews. As opposed to what most of them are saying, in my opinion, Brie was perfect for Captain Marvel's role. She and Samuel Jackson (with Goose) have absolutely nailed it! And it's a really bad idea to compare this one with Wonder Woman because Wonder Woman was already so terrible and compared to this, it's just... straight BAD! The story was great, and the coherence was just AMAZING. Marvel has done it again, and do yourselves a favor and watch it instead of reading the badly written reviews.

But in all, Marvel Studios did not disappoint yet again!

Now about the movie, except the background music, nothing is good. So many jump cuts to make one action sequence clearly exposes the lack of choreography. Action scene containing CGI are laughable, especially considering this movie is made under marvel's banner. Secondly, Brie Larson can't run. Seriously, she don't know how to run. It was the sole funny moment for me when she was running weirdly in different scenes. Apart from that, the story is pretty generic, nothing out of the blue from other origin movies. I don't even remember the names of characters that I saw, most of them were insignificant. Dialogue delivery is also pathetic, felt like it was being read off script like in a school recital. For me, this movie doesn't do Marvel universe or Stan Lee justice.

In fact, I shudder to think where Marvel Comics would be if not for the life-saving injection of Marvel Studios and the resulting fan base that even includes a sect that have no interest comics. However, uniquely in the case of Captain Marvel, I feel like it's quite useful to be familiar with the Kelly Sue DeConnick canon beginning in 2012 as well as the reprisal in 2014. This comic is unabashedly feminist. Does that suck the fun out of it? No. It doesn't man-bash, but rather empowers, which is what I thought was at the heart of feminism anyway. The comic showcases a woman with an enormous native strength of will that predates the assumption of her super powers. This is accomplished without a shred of bitchiness, and is actually representative of most of the women in my life. Certainly, Carol encounters everyday obstacles exclusive to women, having been told since childhood she can't do certain things in light of her being a ""girl"". She doesn't always deal with these obstacles perfectly, but she also doesn't give credence to her detractors by feeling like she has to prove herself. After all, she has bigger issues to deal with...like saving the world. As a 40-something year old man, while I was acutely aware of the nuances, I never once felt like the DeConnick Captain Marvel was shoving an agenda down my throat, nor did I feel like I was reading a frilly ""girl's comic"".

","Its not the best Marvel film out there but also far from the worst. It finds itself pretty much in the higher midsection. Before the film was announced I really was not familiar with the character and so everything was new and surprising for me. The concept itself was interesting.... I loved that it took part in a different era, although I had hoped they would emphasize even more on that 90s feeling and with more references.
The plot itself had promising and well done moments but also some rather mediocre ones, that really weren't too interesting to follow. What I really liked was that it also worked as a origin movie for the character Nick Fury. Also I liked that characters from various other films pop up here and there.
The acting was fine. Brie Larson was quite well, not really amazing or anything but she fitted her role adequately . I liked Samuel L. Jackson who portrayed here the younger version of Nick Fury. Great performance with which he obviously had a lot of fun. Jude Law was often a bit overacting, in the first half of the film he is all right but it was a bit too much in the second. I did like Annette Bening however.... an unusual role and one that could have been very one dimensional but she added a lot to it. Exciting cameos by Chris Evens, Scarlett Johansson and Mark Ruffalo.

626,8 March 2019,rontino1,10," A pre-viewing commentary-Lighten up people! It's a comic book!
","I have not seen this movie yet but I will regardless of all the (usual) negativity being published. People need to get it into their heads that this is a fantasy movie based on a COMIC BOOK. Don't expect The Godfather type of a movie. It is meant to be fun and fantastic. I still read the old Marvel comic books (using the Marvel Unlimited App) from the 60s through the 80s because I love them! (I do not enjoy the later iterations but that is a personal preference). There is a lot of corniness and poor dialogue that is in these comic books but it is part of the fun.
My point here is that these movies are pretty accurate in conveying the original content of the comic books. All these nay-sayers are expecting (or demanding) some epic Dr. Zhivago type scripting and it it totally out of line.
And what most of you younger people do not understand is that until we got Marvel movies like The X-men and Iron Man, we had 90% garbage for Marvel movies. The special effects were almost always horrible! The scripting was rarely decent and the photography was usually very primitive. Now that we have CGI and studios are spending money to make good comic book movies with top name stars, we have nothing to complain about. Don't get me wrong, there are better and worse in the these movies but they are miles above what we used to put up with. And how is this any different from all other movies.
If you don't like comic books, don't see these movies! Or, if you can just accept them as they are, you might find them very enjoyable.
This may seem a bit preachy but I have been burned multiple times by people saying how bad a Marvel movie is that turned out to be one of my favorites.
So...let's lighten up and have some fun!",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","What is with all the negativity? The movie is good, not great but most definitely not a bad movie! Some of these reviewers need to revisit the origin movies of iron man, captain america, thor and hulk (if u consider it a part of this storyline). This movie does suffer from a poor Marvel villain but which one doesn't.
My positives to take away were how enjoyable this movie is. I mean Captain Marvel was cornered into a tough spot, to follow on origin stories of Guardians of the Galaxy, and Black Panther is almost an unfortunate task. It has to tie up a few loose ends, check. It has the typical Marvel fun, check. Even after having a complicated origin story it doesn't drag much. Yes, her character didn't have much depth but has roots in how she was trained probably (don't wanna get into spoilers so won't say much) just saying, she was by no means a hero, which is a cool continuity check. Anyways Marvel Universe characters, especially the originals have grown into their lovable selves over multiple movies. All things considered, everybody needs to chill with the negativity.

In application, it fell flat, lacking the beautiful marriage between sound and momentum as was done with perfection in Thor: Ragnarok.

","I watched a few reviews for this movie before seeing it, and I liked it a lot more the general consensus. Now, Im not saying the film is perfect...I have some nitpicks but overall I thought this was another great edition to the MCU. For starters, I saw a lot of complaints that the character herself was wooden, flat,one dimensional,void of personality, too perfect etc. I did not see this at all. Yes, her character is more stoic. She's not like Iron Man or Star-Lord quipping up a storm. And partly this may be because her character is told to be a better warrior she has to hide her emotions. This is said by Yon-Rogg(Jude Law) within in the first 10 minutes. Yet because she is still learning to control her powers, you see these moments where her true personality shines through. Not too mention there is vulnerability with her character as she doesnt know who she is or where she came from and she's struggling to make sense of it all. I actually really liked her characterization. Now one negative I would have to say/agree with when it comes to her character, is that she was a bit too powerful (mainly the third act). Once she realizes/comes into her full potential she takes down the antagonists really easily. They try and extend the fight scenes by having them strong enough to get up again after her blasts, but theres not really much of a moment where they have the upperhand or its more of a level playing field. Which, it does make sense considering the powers she has, and the powers they don't...it just doesnt make it a particularly engaging fight. But that was my only major qualm about the character. I thought she was awesome and in the scene where she comes into her own and she embraces the human side of her (where it flashes to the past of her getting knocked down and then getting up again - and thats not a spoiler because that shown in the trailers) very nearly made me had tears in my eyes. And also, I am really excited to see her in Endgame.

","I've been a comic book reader since I was a child. I don't get to read as many these days, but I am thrilled to see so many of the comics I love having stories told on the big screen and the small screen.
Captain Marvel was never one of my favorite characters. I never disliked the character. I just tended to read more earth focused comics (X-Men, Spider-Man, The Avengers, Moon Knight and such)... But I know about the character and was happy to see her getting her own film.
And the film made me a much bigger fan of the character (the same way Ant Man and Guardians of the Galaxy films gave me a greater appreciation for those characters even though in comic book form they were not my favorites).
Some of my newfound love of the character can be attributed to the excellent job Brie Larson does bringing Carol Danvers to life.
I also enjoyed the different approach they took with telling an origin story. It was a very empowering character and I can only begin to imagine how little girls must feel seeing this hero on the screen... I found it inspirational even as a 40+ year old man.
The VFX were too notch. I was very impressed with how far they have come with the de-aging effects. Never once did I feel like I was watching anything but a younger Samuel L. Jackson on screen. A big jump from earlier films were the Effect was good but still a bit unreal looking.
The entire cast was great. I can't wait to see the further adventures of Captain Marvel.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","Nice acting, what there was of it. Mostly, I got the impression that these fine actors & actresses just stood there while someone just paints on all the digital effects. I was, as others have said, bored with this movie. The entire last 1/4 of the film was a nice fireworks display but that's about it.
If you are looking for an equivalent of Avengers 1 where all the Avengers stand in a circle -- ready to fight the unknown armies from space, after just barely getting over fighting among themselves -- forget it in this movie.
If all you need is to see how Nick Fury loses his eye -- then by all means see this film.
I found the Heroine confusing. It's like linear time isn't good enough anymore -- we've got to have past, present & future timelines. Yes, it can be boring & confusing at the same time.
Spoiler alert -- Good guys become bad guys for no apparent reason. Remember those old 60's films where everyone is chasing after the latest missile plans on microfilm -- well just replace the microfilm with some unexplained energy thing, and you've got it ... plus more fireworks than 100 July 4th's

I also really liked the story and had a good twist to it. To be honest, I was really disappointed after Antman and Wasp and thought that was the most underwhelming Marvel film, especially because the first Antman was so clever and funny and blew me away.

It was nice to see him as a ""good cop"" type, but they either should make a Nick Fury movie that shows how he became the sarcastic, strong, hilarious tough guy he really is now, or they should've shown the latter side of him in this movie.
2) I wish she could have beat the crap out of Jude Laws character without her powers to show that she was a strong warrior without them. I thought they downplayed the strong feminist side of Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel.

Perhaps. But, having been cautioned by early opinions, I found the story to be clear cut, the performances to be solid (Brie Larson was spectacular), the Marvel humour to be fully present and appropriate to the tone of the characters and the special effects great. In my ad hoc exit poll (OK, more like casual chats with others as we exited the theatre) I found others also enjoyed it. So, I am giving this film an 8.5 (really good) out of 10. So, I say.

She had some of that young soldier wants to prove themselves mentality impulsivness, yet which you see develop and I expect to see a lot more depth and maturity of character in her next appearance (yet with the same light hearted fun to her personality!) Also LOL to reviews saying she didnt show enough emotion when she is repeatedly told to curb her emotion during her training and she is supposed to he a serious soldier like character (yet that also has a lot of fun). The movie rang as a true superhero origin story, not the most original in the world and they all have cliches but was made up for in details, dialogue, and actor chemistry.
Gotta say look at critic and user rating disparity, I dont always agree with critics but it is rare to see that high of a disparity and the low ratings might have to do with being threatened by a new era of female led superheroes movies-> you wont see that admited in the reviews but the details of the lower end ratings just dont make sense, did we watch the same movie?

","I watched this movie expecting nothing. I don't know the character in comics, and I didn't know it was (or how it was) connected to the Avengers movies, so I watched it with zero expectations.
I found a fresh action comedy, nice characters, nice retro 90s music according to the setting of the movie (I'm on my 30s, so 90's music is my stuff!) and pop culture references, a simple (maybe at points predictable but not annoying) but well paced story, and the connected ending that everyone (...but me) expected.
And a cat.
Brie Larson was really great (played a completely different character than in ""Room"", at such point that I didn't realised it was her until the usual post view research) and had great chemistry with S. L. Jackson they were a lot of fun together, and no annoying secondary characters (that's a big plus!).
Only thing that seemed boring was the designs, suits, spaceships, etc... everything seems too similar, even if it's all part of the same universe, it already started boring me on the second Avengers movie... but wasn't something that ruined it for me, it's just that it didn't feel fresh, I guess there was no way out of it for directors/writers...
Anyways, very good and fun movie, another one for Marvel on the style of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and ""Thor: Ragnarok"".

So to my review: the movie is truly enjoyable, great visual and enjoyable with good characters with some marvel humor here and there. But somehow marvel movies somewhat has the same plot line. i cant help it but i felt like this movie has the same plot-line as IRON MAN. i mean some hero who has some power with the same trusted friend turning out be a bad guy and what not.

787,12 March 2019,eden-rabatsch,8," Subversive film that packs in plenty of superhero fun
","Captain Marvel is on first blush a reasonable addition to the MCU but the more you scratch away at the veneer and this film starts to show a much more radical, and way more interesting, thematic structure which more reflects Boden and Fleck's indie background then Disney's usual universe.
Ambitiously, it tries to give both an origin story for Capt Marvel AND Nick Fury while using memory jumps to reveal that origin story to Carol Danvers in real time. Things get understandably bumpy in a torturous beginning as they set the table so the exposition can fall in place.
Luckily, once the first act is over it doesn't matter much because the charismatic cast do their thing and any missteps are layered over by Larson, Jackson and Mendelsohn (Ok and Goose) even if it some of it seems forced. Ironically, the greatest weakness is the action - the directors just don't seem that interested and want to get back to the story.
So why is this film going to be studied decades from now. It might be the best film since the original Gaslighting in exploring how women are told to keep their power in check, to not be emotional by male mentors only to find perhaps there is another way forward. This is where the film sings in defining the difference between Power and Empowerment. One single montage of a girl becoming a woman told to slow down and not take chances in 8 frames is brilliant storytelling.
On top of that the reversal of the Kree/Skrull power relationship so that we flip our sympathies to the dispossessed again speaks more to 2019 then 1990's.

818,8 March 2019,Horst_In_Translation,6," Not bad, not great either
","""Captain Marvel"" is a new 2019 film that runs for minimally over 2 hours and was written and directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck. These two have really worked together for a long time, also on some quality projects, so here they get their shot at the world's biggest superhero franchise as of course this one we got here is the most recent entry into the Marvel universe. And the title could no make it any more obvious. The lead actress is Oscar winner Brie Larsen and most of all with Oscar nominees Bening, Jackson and Law we have a fairly decent supporting cast, although Jackson is probably lead too. This film plays in the mid-1990s and takes place before Jackson summons his Avengers team. They are all not there yet, so also not a force in this movie, but Agent Coulson is and there is one scene in particular when we find out how close he and Fury are, namely when Coulson lets his buddy and the target get away and trusts him completely in making the right decision. This is the story of a female hero who knows virtually nothing about her past, but has some very impressive super powers that she fails to keep under control, however. So the entire movie is basically a journey into the woman's past, how she she finds out where she originates from and what links her with Bening's character, one that has great significance, more than you'd think compared to the limited screen time she has. Of course, Stan Lee gets also his moment here as we see him in a train when Larson's character chases a bad guy with a reference to a movie that Lee actually appeared in in the mid-1990s. And very early on, there is also another really nice tribute to Lee that I liked a lot, at the very beginning in fact. Apart from that, the comedy does not happen too rarely either here and there were more than just a few funny moments. My personal favorite was perhaps when Fury gets scanned and we hear someting like earthling, not a potential danger and finally his reaction. I must say I like Samuel L. Jackson quite a bit, so it was nice to have him featured so prominently in here. Or his character I shall say.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

",Though this movie has problems I had a blast watching it. It has great action and the movie also looks stunning. It has some really good performances (and some not good performances) and humor that lands (for the most part) it also finds really clever ways to twist things around with the overall threat of the story and our main villain. All the de aging effects are stunning and the movie works excellently with the 90s vibe. But of course like any other movie has it's problems. It does suffer tonal inconsistencies that throw you out of the movie including some choices of music that don't match up with scenes. It also has plot holes: why did the skrull turn into captain marvel when if he just didn't do it he would've survived and would've changed nothing? And the sad thing is that captain marvel just isn't enough of a character to be interesting. So some of the criticism toward Brie Larson is unfair because she didn't have much to work with. But at the same time Brie Larson is not giving that good of a performance. Even though Samuel Jackson and Ben Mendelsohn are giving wonderful performances. And I am not saying this because I hate women or I'm misogynistic I'm just stating my opinion and it has nothing to do with any of that.otherwise this is one of the most fun movies I've seen this year and I cannot wait to buy it on 4K.

If you rated typical superhero movie fair like Aquamam a 10 and Captain Marvel below a 5 I can't take your reviews seriously. Because both of these movies are fun and have holes. The Captain Marvel story however is more surprising and compelling. And Brie Larson in a very medicore performance for her is still better than Jason Momoa. Although Jason is more attractive than Brie. This is very good movie. Probably a solid 6-7 for anyone that likes typical superhero movies that doesn't go into it with a lot of bias,/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","Nothing new is brought to the table here. For a superhero/origin story, a fish-out-of-water, espionage, 90's nostalgia-hit, a spectacularly disinteresting film. None of the actors seem keen on being there, in particular the star. Anyone who's seen 'Room' is more than aware of Brie Larson's acting chops, and here they are on full disguise. Her displayed emotions throughout the film range from smugness to total emotional emptiness. Boring story, predictable and unsatisfying twist, low-quality humour (if any) and someone please send Ben Mendelsohn to a speech pathologist to fix the lisp, and then to a linguistics specialist to remind him and the writers that just because the MCU has given the universe English for a common language, doesn't mean they'll use the same phrases as us.

As every human she is imperfect, Marvel has done a great job by showing ""real-life"" superheroes: they are not always trying to do the right thing l like Captain America or Black Panther.

","One problem for me is that I had recently seen Battle Angel Alita, which was what Captain Marvel could, and should, have been.
Another was that I had read the Captain Marvel and Ms. Marvel comics as a kid; way back in the 70s, and this movie version of Captain Marvel just didn't have the right attitude somehow. The movie version lost 50 IQ points, the hard-as-nails military attitude, and Brie Larsen's little girl voice in some scenes just didn't seem right.
In the Ms. Marvel comic series back in the 70s, she was an Air Force officer and chief of security at Cape Kennedy (Marvel Super-Heroes #13, March 1968). She got her powers in the same radioactive explosion that caused the original Captain Marvel to die of cancer. After resigning from the Air Force, she became a magazine editor who tackled issues like equal pay, equal rights, sexual harassment, etc. with J. Jonah Jameson as her favorite foil. The comic version was smart, fearless, and could make the tough decisions; in one issue of the comic, she let her best friend die in order to save hundreds of strangers. It looked like the movie version would have let them die to save her friend.
The comic version of Captain Marvel did a lot better job with the ending. In the comics, she tackled a young mutant named Rogue, who took her powers and sent her into a coma for 10+ years. That would have been a great ending for this movie. To wake up when Thanos snaps his fingers would have been a lot better than the ending we got.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","My wife and I both thought it was bland. The action and special effects were nifty but Captain Marvel (I assume poor writing, not necessariily Brie Larsons performance) was dull. Granted there is a reason she acted in certain ways due to her situation but the direction of her performance was so stern, stiff, ""i got this"" that it was boring and not much was ever in doubt. The lack of emotion (also could be explained away by odd circumstance) but it left us empty.
As the audience walked out of the movie the things we overheard were similar to what we were thinking. She is so cocky so stupidly arrogant and simple flash backs of her childhood and youth getting back up and trying again didn't cut it for me in terms of building out the characters later actions.
Perhaps the studio billing this character as being possibly the strongest character in the marvel universe set it up to fail.....it seems the actor, writer, director took that to heart and made her more emotionless than needed and without full explanation as she explores her power in the end against enemy ships she takes needless risks allowing battle ship type hits to her person she could have avoided and shrugs them off in dare I say a super man level arrogance (sorry DC). She is essentially marvels superman now, with hand blasters, not eye beams and superman is dull dull dull because we all know no one can beat him.
I started reading marvel back in the early 70's. I stopped in the 80's. I was familiar with Mar Vell but never much cared for the intergalactic stuff so didn't read much.
I came in knowing this would be different, read some reviews to try and kick that bias out. I think i gave it a fair shot but it the tone for the main character was a dud.

1) for long time marvel readers there is a main story line reversal here where once bad is victim, is good that will blow you away in not good ways. that was tough to stomach but bear in mind I am more than 30 years out of reading comics. Its still messing with me a day later. It feels so wrong.
2) there is a character in the film that others in the film want data from, they send them on a pointless retrieval mission that puts that character in danger, which ends up in ambush and it never gets explained why the hell they would risk them in that way. outside of captain marvels dullness this plot point was the only major item i found.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

B: Alliance military sponsored film promoting constructive lessons on our reality and encouraging humanity to get off its knees and embrace a positive future. Captain Marvel was clearly a type B movie for me.
The movie hit all the right nights for a great story telling experience: likeable characters, good chemistry, believable motivations, nostalgia for the 90's, exciting action and an uplifting sense of purpose. My only complaint was that the movie wasn't longer; more fleshed out flashback scenes would add more depth... I want to see C.M. doing karaoke at the bar and getting hit on by some cocky pilots!

1. Loved the message that humans never give up.
2. Black / White / friendly aliens... who cares if we look funny...there's going to be big culture differences, but we can all be friends.
3. Disclosure is coming (if you are paying attention you know that there has been a big coverup of alien life, secret space programs, true Earth history). This film is preparing the public for life in a Cosmic community.

Instead of saying she's not as pretty, people started saying she can't act. But honestly Brie did a great job. She was strong and not gullable. She follows her heart throughout the movie. Her friendship with Fury and her best friend was wonderfully portrayed. Story was nicely tied up considering they explained everything in one movie and I have no questions about her past after seeing the film. She is seen struggling to prove herself for a long time, in a period where women were not given many opportunities and that resonates with a lot of us personally.

Carol Danvers is annoying, simply put, she's overpowered, arrogant and childish. Her character screams rebellion. No character development. Her failures are implicitly blamed on men mocking her because she's a an ambitious, arrogant *girl*.
The action scenes sucked because there was no real stakes.
The movie was feminist, which is best shown in the scenes with the black woman and her daughter, not to mention this was co-directed by a woman with a female lead that can obliterate any one. The 'highlight' is when the daughter begs her mother to go on a suicide mission and leave her because that is a great example. Notice the genius scientist is a woman.
The things you will remember are the Flerken cat and the Skrull leader Talos. Talos was the best character along with Fury and Coulson who got next to no screen time.
Carol's mansplaining spiritual leader who got some excellent points to make had suddenly become evil after Carol discovered the Kree's are actually the oppressors. And when he challenged her to hand-to-hand combat, she blasted him into oblivion in her arrogant manner.

","This film failed massively in letting us get to know who the major characters are, or even the two alien races who despise each other. Even now I can't remember if we're even told why the two races were at war with each other in the first place. For a large part of the first act Danvers can't remember who she is; and we are only assisted in finding out via occasional flashbacks or voiceovers. Frankly I felt as confused as the character. We only find out about the main character's background with tidbits of info. I didn't really understand what was happening or why; and despite some flashy action sequences I found myself bored. The point when I started to become interested in the film was following a chase sequence in which we finally get to meet Fury. Jackson was de-aged for the entire film; and it looked flawless. The biggest compliment I can pay is that after the first time we see him I quickly forgot about the special effects and just saw him as young Fury. In the second act we begin to discover more about Danvers, as she begins to learn about herself. We see the origin of her powers; and it's at that point that the film finally begins to be interesting. I don't know why they couldn't have just started with that and told a linear origin story; instead of doing all the stupid, confusing flashbacks. Danvers and Fury end up turning this film into a sort of buddy cop style of film. The two of them are working together, cracking jokes while trying to discover the mystery of her identity. This part was actually fun. There's also a segment where Danvers meets with an old friend Maria and her daughter Monica. I have to admit that at no point did I feel like these girls were at one time close friends, I just didn't buy it. That said the relationship Danvers had with her friend's daughter was cute. Other fun aspects include the 90's soundtrack and hits of nostalgia. We also meet Goose the cat. The cat was certainly one of the most interesting characters. The last act is ok, although it was let down by the fact that it became a standard CGI fight. What's worse though is that it wasn't even a well shot fight. The colour pallet was mostly grim; the choreography was nothing to write home about; and the outcome was downright predictable. Overall, There were some aspects which I enjoyed, as well some parts where I was bored.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","I actually fell asleep in the movie theater at one point! And I'm a big fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films, and went into watching this with the usual great anticipation and hope. This one disappoints. It, unlike most of the MCU (or X-Men or even Fantastic 4) movies, lacks the ""magic"" that makes a superhero movie work (an interesting character, intelligent writing, humor, joy, an interesting, original story). It starts off with the main character on an alien planet with her powers already - before we even know who she is, have any relationship with her, and should care why she is there. There is no character development, she is just dropped in our laps, and as the person I was with said - who is new to this character - she thought there was a big backstory available somewhere else. The desperately needed plot that proceeds is uninteresting, and ends up suddenly being centered around aliens on Earth we know even less about. There is no emotional center to the movie, no sense of a character arc or drama or stakes that matters. Just a lot of POW WHAM moments, that then get bigger, and we are expected to accept that as drama and ""the story"". The jokes are infantile, Jude Law's character is a cardboard villain, and Brie Larsen was poorly cast in this Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel role as she exhibits no characterization; she takes no joy in being Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel, her Carol Danvers is painfully dull and seems to have no significant personal character herself, to genuinely be a dull person, who then becomes a dull superhero, but that she can glow and punch the movie makers force on the audience as the reason we are supposed to gormless-ly cheer her. Brute force does not a superhero make. This is why I actually momentarily fell asleep in the movie theater at one point. Unlike Iron Man, Black Widow, Black Panther, Bruce Banner, she has no * character story *. She is cardboard superhero that one would expect from someone who did not know how to make superhero movies, certainly not the gateway character to the next Phase in the MCU franchise. A further issue is that this character - never famous like the Hulk, etc from the comics because she isn't as originally interesting a character (not a dramatic character, not a scientist, not funny, not a strong personal character, not a person with a dramatic story or backstory, etc) - still had a character that was well fleshed out in the comic books. And could have been made with her existing material into something even better for the movie. Instead, the 5 (!) writers on the movie went with cliches, dropped the comic book base content and origin story and made a convoluted plot that just crashes and flops worse than the place crash in the movie. I have never been so disappointed in an MCU film. It's a shame, because this character certainly could have been great if handled by a better writer(s). It bodes badly for the MCU next Phase.

","I left the theatre saying to my friend ""That was pretty good hey?"" but as the 2 hours of my life I lost replayed itself I quickly corrected myself to ""Actually that was the worst Marvel movie I've seen in a very long time wasn't it?"" My friend agreed Marvel was probably due to have a flub after many great hits in a row. There's just nothing original about this ""Hero"" movie. Brie Larson is becoming the type of actor Marvel is leaning towards. Pretty face, but absolutely no life experience and for a super-hero with god like powers she really seemed uncoordinated to the blind eye. I was looking in the credits for how many stunt doubles were required to carry Brie's lack of athletic ability through this movie to try and give some credibility to ""the most powerful hero in the Marvel Universe!"" Personally I think Caitlyn Jenner would have been a better option to play Captain Marvel and get across the points that Disney and Marvel seem to be attempting to get across in this movie. The whole character is so boring because she's like Superman, but without the weakness to kryptonite. She has no weakness whatsoever and crushes her enemies like flies. I was unimpressed by this film, and I think it will be an insult to all the other great characters in the Marvel Universe if she really is the hero of hero's that rescues the Marvel Universe from Thanos.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

1004,10 March 2019,amanda_276,9," Marvelous origin story! ;)
","Wow! I loved Captain Marvel. At the very beginning I was a bit apprehensive with the way they just threw you into the story and its jostled glimpses into Carol's recollections, which are essentially the first things you see of the character, being fragmented, abrupt and seemingly confusing-which seems to be all many viewers were able to take away from that now clearly very consciously made decision of presentation, as they literally were a mangled mind mess of the character's being-however, it IS made clearer if you continue watching and engaging in the storyline. It smoothes itself out in very clever ways as you watch and learn who Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel is, and her demeanor makes sense as she learns who she is, where she came from, and what her purpose is, as goes in origin stories. I would love to learn more about her backstories, which we only get tiny glimpses of, but as it takes getting to the third act of the story for her person to be self-realized, it makes sense why our understanding of her past is so minimally exposed or expanded upon. It takes by means of a comical, mostly predictable yet non-compromising story build-up in the first two thirds of the movie to lead to our ultimate Captain Marvel revelations and wielding of her true identity being acted out as the last third of the story unfolds. Without including spoilers, anyone who watched the movie should be able to make sense of Larson's mostly indifferent, emotionally-detached persona, which is kept intact through much of the movie, as she is established as a combat-driven wartime fighter meant to be acted out with such indifference in an almost machine-like weaponry mindset and deployment. ""Don't be funny. Don't show anger. Don't be human."" I enjoyed every bit of the plot line's twists and turns and character interactions that led us to discover who is in the end, Captain Marvel. You are ultimately taken on a wild ride of self-realization with a good number of badass-kickings on full display, in this introduction to Captain Marvel.

Moment) you find out how she gets her powers near the middle-end) so most of the film Your just wondering how she got them and when you find out your like ""oh right ok was that it"" I just felt like it had lots missing to it...I didnt really care much about her..I was never really woried or felt much toward her like I did for wonder women or any of the avengers...I think the actress who played captain marvel was very woden and not a very good actress...scarlet johanson played her part really well In the avengers so hopefully she can get some tips of her!....I was just really disappointed that this is the hero who's supposed to save the day in Endgame...I thought her powers were not amazing and felt like when she used them they didn't really do much(unless your a juxbox or door) tbh if your seeing this to the up to endgame you don't need to!...has nothing in it that ties to endgame apart from the credit scene which you can get on YouTube and tbh it wasn't all that(if you wondering how fury gets the pager.......*Little Spoiler*********** ******************",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

1037,19 April 2019,marveltstodd,9," A fun appetizer to Marvel's ""Avengers: Endgame""
","I felt like I had to write this review due to all the negative reviews posted on I.M.D.B (Internet Movie Data Base)'s website. It appears the majority of the reviews are criticisms toward the lead actress, Brie Larson due to an awards speech about diversity in film reviews by critics. One thing to remember here is that in 2019, social media rules the world and everyone thinks his or her opinion should matter, even when that person criticizes a film and does not get paid for doing so as their occupation. I am a fan of film, comic books, and the Marvel Cinematic Universe and I am doing a review of the film only as a hobby. I have seen the edited and un-edited speech given by Brie Larson and I think people are over-reacting and taking their personal/political feelings out on a film that is pretty entertaining. Has the ""super hero origin story"" been done frequently? Yes, however this is a story line that has been going back to Superman's first appearance in Action Comics in 1938. The beauty of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and why it works so well in its many successes, is each character has a different personality, power set, background, and each film helps sets up bigger and continuous story lines. A viewer in the audience may not like Captain Marvel as much as Thor, Iron Man, or Black Widow, but the person sitting next to him or her may. The film introduces a new character in the M.C.U. moving forward in Phase 4 and beyond in Carol Danvers. She is played with charm by Brie Larson, if a bit flat, but the great thing about the M.C.U., is the character will be built upon with each appearance, story arches, and directors. The power set displayed by Captain Marvel is visually exciting and new for the M.C.U. The film also introduces us to comic book fan favorites, the Skrulls (hopefully this will lead to Secret Invasion down the line) and gives more of a back story of the Kree. The leader of the Kree known as the Supreme Intelligence (artificial intelligence) and is played brilliantly by Annette Bening in a duel role. The film brings back a younger Nick Fury played by Samuel L. Jackson, which some amazing de-aging technology (you forget while you are watching it is C.G.I.) and introduces the viewer to a fun side-kick in Goose, a ""cat"" that once belonged to Carol's mentor. The film has some spectacular action sequences and since it was set in the 1990s has some great music and fashion through-backs of that decade. While it may not be as complex as ""Captain America: The Winter Solider"", or as grand as ""Avengers: Infinity War"", it is a fun and entertaining ride.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","I don't review films often, but I think that Avengers: Endgame (2019) is worth talking about. First of all, I saw Captain Marvel (2019) for the second time recently, and this time I paid for the ticket. I now think that it's one of the best MCU films, if I'm being honest. I've never been a Marvel fan because I don't like to be a fan of anything, really. In my opinion, being a fan of something is for uninformed people. But Marvel films, for example, are worth seeing at least once because they contain messages from the Anglo-American establishment. The only problem is that you have to be informed in order to notice and understand these messages. Marvel films are also enjoyable to watch. I'm not one of those people who dislike Brie Larson because of something that she said. She plays the role of Carol Danvers in Captain Marvel. I've got better things to do than hating some woman actress. I mean, what do people expect at this point? Sure, I guess that they need an outlet for their anger, and there are many things to be angry about these days, especially for white middle class men, but picking Hollywood as the object of hatred seems silly to me. Hollywood has been feeding them propaganda their whole lives, but now, all of a sudden, they are angry because some actress bluntly stated the agenda. I don't mean to insult them because I understand their situation, but I think that they should pick up a book and read once in a while. They'll feel better and be more informed. This is actually one of the problems with Western people now. Carroll Quigley mentioned this matter in one of his interviews. Western people hardly ever read anymore. Instead of reading, they watch television or see films. Nowadays, there's a new distraction, which is playing video games. Therefore, because of their lack of knowledge and lack of critical thinking, Western people can be so easily manipulated by the authorities. When it comes to me, what I find a little interesting about Brie Larson is that her personality is kind of like mine. This is a rare case. Therefore, I really don't feel like hating her. Anyway, Captain Marvel, the character, doesn't play an important role in Avengers: Endgame, as it turns out. I did find Larson's acting to be pretty good in the film. Carol Danvers is important in her own film, but, in Avengers: Endgame, her importance in the story has been way overblown before the release of the film. Avengers: Endgame is kind of a mess. It's not really a piece of garbage because there are good things in it, but the script is so poorly written that the film ends up being one of the worst MCU films, and perhaps the worst one. Honest reviewers on IMDb have already pointed out the numerous flaws of this film. There's fat, pathetic Thor. There are the inconsistencies with time travel. There's the silly humor. There's the poorly thought out final battle. There are the continuity problems. Yep, this film is a real stinker in some ways. Still, I did find it to be entertaining. It didn't make me feel bored. I think that out of the two most recent Avengers films, Avengers: Infinity War (2018) was much more important for Marvel and the filmmakers than Avengers: Endgame. Therefore, Avengers: Infinity War contains the cool action, the filmmaking craft, and the important messages that the filmmakers wanted people to see. Avengers: Endgame, on the other hand, turns out to be a film with leftovers. Thanos said his piece about overpopulation and limited resources in Avengers: Infinity War. He succeeded in killing half of all life in the universe with the snappening. Naturally, Marvel couldn't let this be the end of the story. People would have been outraged at such a depressing finale. Therefore, Avengers: Endgame had to be made so that the Avengers could defeat Thanos and undo his doings, though Thanos does have a few more things to say this time as well. This time he makes a little speech about rewriting history and brainwashing people. In addition, Iron Man and Captain America had to be killed off because Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans have been playing these roles long enough. In addition, the writers and the filmmakers saw an opportunity to patch up some of the inconsistencies from previous MCU films. Rene Russo came back to better develop the character of Frigga because of a lack of development in Thor: The Dark World (2013). Hawkeye gets more screen time as well because people complained about his lack of screen time in previous films. So, the filmmakers wanted to service the fans, and the fans sure did get serviced with Avengers: Endgame. They got serviced hard. In my opinion, Avengers: Endgame turned out to be a leftovers and patch up film after the main event that was Avengers: Infinity War. And, of course, Avengers: Endgame sets up the next phase of the MCU. Funnily enough, the directors, Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, are now responsible not only for some of the best MCU films but also for the worst and most ridiculous MCU film.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

Brie Larson does a very 'meh' job, she doesn't know how to act and can barley show any emotion. She is also too over powered to the point were she is just boring and I just hope she doesn't ruin Endgame. The attempts at jokes were not very good, and why did the Skrulls all have British accents and it was just plain awkward when Talos was making 'jokes'. The twist that they were the good guys was good though. Nick Fury felt out of character and was acting like an idiot and losing his eye to a 'cat' scrape really? They try so hard to make her important, the pager was also very stupid ""call me only when its an emergency"" what about New York or Ultron?

1157,9 March 2019,Magow-Intermean,10," Captain Marvel Review
","Amnesiac Vers (Brie Larson) is training to fight a war with Kree leader Yon-Rogg (Jude Law). But when she is captured and interrogated by the enemy Skrull Talos (Ben Mendelsohn), she glimpses her past life on Earth as test pilot Carol Danvers. Chasing her captors there, she must save the world with the help of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson).
Kicking off on an alien planet with an entirely unfamiliar cast of characters is a bold way to start your big new superhero origin story. But then directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, the team behind Mississippi Grind and Half Nelson, don't pander to audiences. So they set us down on the alien world of Hala and throw us in with Vers (Brie Larson), a mysteriously powered amnesiac training to join ""noble warrior heroes"" the Kree. She scoffs at authority, drives herself to extremes and sometimes loses her temper. She's Marvel's first solo female lead and she is not here to play.
If you've been slacking in Marvel history class you'll have to figure out both Kree and Skrull on the fly, because the film doesn't pause for exposition. The former civilisation is ruled by an AI called the Supreme Intelligence. Vers is mentored by a Kree called Yon-Rogg (Jude Law), a charismatic leader who prepares her for their war against the shape-shifting Skrull. Guardians Of The Galaxy's baddie Ronan The Accuser is among them (Lee Pace makes an appearance) but that doesn't mean they're all genocidal madmen. The Skrull, meanwhile, look like Deep Space Nine visitors, or alternatively like literally anyone, thanks to those camouflage abilities, and that sneaky power creates a rich fug of paranoia over the whole story.
This is not another cheap girl-power cliché; it's an explicitly feminist apotheosis.
One way or another, Vers and her prey end up on Earth in 1995. The Skrull, led by Ben Mendelsohn's Talos, are searching for Dr Wendy Lawson (Annette Bening) to secure an all-important piece of tech she invented. Vers, who's beginning to recover old memories, learns that she was once test pilot Carol Danvers and that Lawson was her boss. She connects with S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson, stunningly well de-aged) and old BFF Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch, nimbly avoiding limiting token-black-friend clichés) to save the tech and save the day.
There's a lot to absorb - a few pauses in the first act might have been welcome - and the film is so anxious to emphasise Danvers' toughness that it sometimes forgets to allow us to glimpse her inner life and (presumable) insecurities; it's a good thing that Larson is both gifted and charismatic, or she'd be a little dull. It also feels like it's been chopped down a lot: some glimpses of Mckenna Grace as the young Carol, showing her troubled relationship with her dad, feel surprisingly thin. You also sense that there might have been more for Bening to do, given how good she is in the little time she's on screen.
Still, once Danvers connects with Fury, their odd-couple banter blasts the film into the stratosphere. There are small but fun fight scenes highlighting Danvers' tenacity, and the joy of seeing Fury having things explained to him for once. There's a friendly cat called Goose who takes a shine to Fury and threatens to steal the entire film. It all unrolls to a killer '90s soundtrack, with bangin' choons from such decade-defining artists as TLC, Elastica and Hole. And as Danvers spends time with Rambeau, we get our first real glimpse under her skin and into her humanity.
It's the last act before this film truly lives up to its potential, but at crunch time it delivers in a more satisfying way than almost any other superhero film of recent years. Carol Danvers' final battle offers a radical message and becomes a powerful metaphor for what could happen if we stop waiting to be told that we are enough; if we stop believing the people who tell us we're too emotional or too weak. Captain Marvel says that, when we stop looking for approval, we can become literally godlike. This is not another cheap girl-power cliché; it's an explicitly feminist apotheosis. Some people will find it disorientating to watch. Captain Marvel offers zero concessions to ease anyone in or win them over to Carol Danvers' point of view. If that makes it hard for some viewers to relate to her, she'll deal.
As a Nick Fury buddy comedy, it's fun. As a feminist fable it's essential. This takes a while to really get going, but when Carol Danvers takes off she is unstoppable.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","Super hero movie fatigue aside (can you please make actual films again, H-Wood?) this is thoroughly mediocre in all aspects. Brie Larson is about as interesting as a hole in the wall. Dour and humorless. Both here and in real life. Way to attack the intended audience. I'm sick and tired on intended and manufactured controverse as a marketing tactic. People are beyond sick of it and are voting with their wallets. These super hero films all blend together eventually and being completely unfamiliar with the character (my first reaction when they announced the film was literally: ""Captain who...?"") I was completely lost as to what was going on half the time. It's colourful and competent craftsmanship as far as effects go but with an uninteresting lead it really becomes a chore. Heck, even the paid off shills seem to be underwhelmed by it. You could easily skip this as it adds nothing to the overall Marvel arc. I bet Marvel is gonna scale back Captain Marvel's involvement in the upcoming Avengers film, as rumored (apparently there's an alternative ending ready to go if this bombs). Awfully bland film. I doubt it'll lose money though. The brand is well established at this point so lots of people are gonna attend just by default Marvel allegiance.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

As a woman AND as a fan of the MCU from the very beginning, I find it incredibly ironic and offensive that the character that is introduced as the hero who brings about Thanos' demise is about as convincing as a cardboard cutout of Brie Larson. On a side note, I'd like to know what it was exactly that people didn't like about Black Widow as a strong female character? Was it the emotional backstory of her character?

You also never feel like she is any real danger. Even the ""intense"" ending battle with her former teammates felt long because there was never any doubt she would win. Lots of lazy writing.

1334,7 April 2019,pronoun36,5," Captain Marvel movie review by Hogan Coad
","Although I greatly admire the Marvel cinematic universe and its contributions to the superhero genre, I have to acknowledge that Captain Marvel is among the weakest of its productions. The best way for me to describe this film is through a hypothetic scenario. Suppose I am an average moviegoer who has only seen a few Marvel movies and doesn't really follow the grand story of it all. Someone then asks me what to expect when seeing a Marvel movie. To this I reply ""some decent action, a few funny moments, and an empowering message."" Even though a lot of other Marvel films try different things with these basic elements, Captain Marvel rides this simple formula to the furthest degree. As a result, a pretty boring experience is conceived. This is easily the most I've yawned while watching a Marvel movie in a long time. Without comparing it to other films within the universe, I'll focus on it as a stand alone movie. As a stand alone film, its still not very interesting. My biggest issue with Captain Marvel is the title character herself played by Brie Larson. I have no doubt that Larson can pull off a great performance, but she gives maybe three facial expressions throughout the whole film. There is also no arch to Carol Danvers' story. She merely learns something she never realized about her past and that's about all there is to her. This is not fault of Larson, bit rather poor directing and generic writing. The supporting cast was easily the best part about the film. Samuel L. Jackson is once again very likable as Nick Fury, the green shape shifting antagonists turn out to be pretty interesting, and Danvers' best friend played by Lashana Lynch gives a very believable performance. Even though these characters are performed well, they still re not written in a unique way. As for everything else, it's all stuff that's been seen before in other superhero films with nothing new or interesting added to the recipe. The humor is standard, the action is standard, and the effects are standard. In fact the effects start to look almost laughably cheap during portions of the final space battle. On the whole, Captain Marvel isn't awful, there just isn't anything to gain from it. The story is predictable with all of its components being done to death already and the main character is not captivating in the least. Captain Marvel simply isn't worth seeing given the impressive lineup of superhero films we've gotten over the past ten years.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

The twists I liked, not loved... but i learned to live with them! Samuel Jackson is great as Nick Fury and so is Ben Mendelsohn as the head Skrull! Goose (Chewie in the comics) steals the show at the end... and plenty of great jokes and humor. My only complaint was the insert of No Doubt's ""I'm just a girl"" which feels a tad predictable... all in all, a great movie and nowhere near as bad or bland as many critics or youtubers claim it to be.

","OK, I get it, it's just make believe sci-fi, but good sci-fi has some plausibility for the future.
Negatives:
1. CGI average at best & a lot of it is just re-using already coded & stored effects from other movies. Why do the cities & spacecraft w/the same physically dumb swooshing sound found in similar movies look as if made-up by a college design major hyper on drugs. Reality plausibility - zero!
2. Dialogue is at a level you would use grocery shopping. Over-simplistic, not intelligent. Aliens have better English articulation & grammar than actual English have. As supposed baddies their dead Satan look is the look du jour in sci-fi. And, why do aliens always have the same body plan as us, i.e. two of every thing except nose, mouth (yes, I know, it's cheaper to clothe a stunt human).
3. Jump points that look borrowed from bee architects? I knew they were smart little critters, but that made no sense. Writers avoided the problem of unimaginable distances & time to travel as usual.
4. The unlimited smorgasbord of energy emanating from her body was laughably dumb, but entertaining. Usual white eyes which mean?
Positives:
1. Liked the now defunct Blockbuster scene; the cat (homage to Guardians?).

","I was looking forward to the movie however, it was extremely disappointing. Yes, it's fun and it can be enjoyable if you can ignore everything else and solely watch JUST the action. But Carol has a lot lacking in her character and it was very hard to relate to her and feel for her. She showed very little emotions, we don't see her cry, and nobody knocks her down - she knocks herself down, and for character development, I feel like this is very bad. She has little to no reactions to when she is remembering her past, or even when she unlocked her true power. I feel like she didn't feel human, and she's not a very good role model for women as a female character, she's not empowering for women and could quite frankly be replaced with a male actor and it would still be the same. Which is okay, I won't say that, that is particularly a horrible thing but I feel like a strong female character should be inspiring for the women in the audience. She feels too dull. There was no character arc. Nothing that happens to her, even the shocking moments of the film, nothing changes her or shapes who she is. It's all too bland.

1409,8 March 2019,erick-hernandez,1," A mess.
","First, this is a review of the movie itself. I know there has been discussion outside regarding cast comments, and sincerely, I just went into the movie and forgot about those things, as what matters for me is the film itself, and its own merits. I am a big fan of the comics and the MCU, and so although I wasn't familiar with this character, I was looking forward to her introduction and understanding how this will impact the MCU. I also know that having a very overpowering character, like Superman, is harder to relate to, so I went into the movie already willing to give them some slack, but hoping they could pull it off and make an awesome movie.
Unfortunately, for many reasons, the movie is simply bad. And yet, it had many things in it that show it could have been much better, so maybe there is hope for a sequel in the future, and are definitely things that can be changed. Let me explain. I think the easiest way to describe how I felt during the movie was that I cringed a lot.
First, I had heard that the main Actress Brie Larson was a really good actress. I can't comment on that as this is the only movie I saw with her, and I definitely want to see other of her works now so I can get a better opinion. But in this movie, her character was portrayed in a very abnoxious manner in most of the film (you know when a person can't be nice or kind to anyone, but just wants to act like a know-it-all jerk?). I don't know whose decision this was, maybe she was asked to portray it this way. There are though some better moments, in particular in the ship with Fury, and with her best friend's child, that she is more likable. I just wish we had seen more of that. I think the tone for her came off unnecessarily cold and again, the way I felt was that it was just being abnoxious. Now, I think this is something that she and they can change going forward, but it did not help when they are introducing us to a new character. This is even worse taking into consideration that they really need audiences to like her, given how difficult it is to connect with such an overpowered character, as is Captain Marvel's case. So, her acting was way off, and I don't know why, and I don't want to put in question her capacity, hence my wanting to see other works from her.
Anyway, moving on. The second most impactful problem is the production and editing. The movie is a long string of moments that should be of either emotion or great action, but that fall flat. I really feel they wanted those moments to be really grand and epic, and I think they actually could have been, but they just felt rushed and unearned, which actually turned them into really cringy. And this is the problem for me, I think that Captain Marvel's story was actually all there, there were lots of good pieces, which were presented, but the way they brought this together, the timing and presentation was beautiful visually, but was just rushed and felt really off for me, personally. So I really feel that it wasn't a lack of compelling story or character motivation, just the way the final cut flows. Those emotional moments, and the action, they were lacking either some more development, or not to be rushed or so obvious. The Skrulls (and Ben Mendelsohn) were great, it was always nice to have Fury and Coulson (I'm a big fan of the Agents of Shield, Coulson is such a charismatic character). Ok, having been unbiased about the movie, I do need to address honestly the Feminism question. I am a person who really enjoys that there are movie with strong female leads, with great stories to tell. And I think Marvel has a lot of potential they still have not taken advantage in terms of female characters to tell more stories about (I mean, Scarlet Witch and Black Widow have been great until now, and I would love to hear more of their stories, and have them lead their own films, i think they deserve more attention. And the actresses have done great!).
I know that some of the directors and cast were open about the feminism part. I have no problem with that. I just feel that it was cringy to force Director Fury to act dumb in some situations, just to give Captain Marvel an air of ""gotcha"", hey, let me lead you. That is just not necessary. I think audiences deserve much better. I loved Alita, which had a great female character and was an awesome movie. In this movie, I felt they always had to prove that Captain Marvel was better than the men around her, and sincerely, it was cringy. The movie is bad, because Brie Larson's acting is bad, and the production was way off.
But, I think those are two things that they can turn around I and sincerely hope they do, and if they do, I will enjoy watching what they do in a sequel. Ah, did I mention I loved what they did with the Skrulls? Well done on that point! And yes, that cat it is cool!",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","My family saw this movie twice on opening weekend. I have been a long-time #CarolCorps member, but my husband and 7 year old daughter knew very little about the character (other than that I liked her). We all loved the movie. It was a lot of fun, great action, good humor, a nice twist of pathos.

","I was really hoping that my preconceptions were wrong - I really wanted this movie to be, at the very least, fun and enjoyable. Alas, it was neither a good film in its own right, nor was it a good addition to the MCU, which is unfortunate to say the least. The acting was bland, Larson, in my view, having been badly miscast, with many people saying that Emily Blunt could have made a better Captain Marvel. The story was the definition of a superhero blueprint. Goose and Jackson were probably my favorite things about this movie, which says a lot.
Then, there is the issue of the existence of this film in the first place - if they really wanted a 'strong female lead' (with which, as a woman, I already have an issue), they should have filmed a Scarlet Witch, or even better, a Black Widow origin story... Cap Marvel is an obscure and rather disliked character (as can be seen by the number of time her runs were cancelled) who does not deserve to sweep in and save the day in Endgame. I will be deeply hurt and disappointed if this will be the case - an overpowered nobody, who was never a part of the original well-loved team, to play as a sort of 'deus ex machina' in the final movie. The marketing for the movie did not help either, but this is a review of the movie, and not the scum tactics employed by the advertisers.
Hence, as much as it saddens me, I cannot in good conscience give this movie more than a 4, due to its lack of originality, bad casting, underwhelming script (seeing as the writers have done well in the indie film department prior to the making of this movie), as well as the late introduction of a new character (into the cinematic universe, that is - I am well aware of the role played by Cap M. in the comics) into a beloved series.
Side note: I also don't believe that the people giving this movie either a 1 or a 10 are doing anyone any favours - you do realize that your scores just balance each-other out, meaning that the rating between 2 and 8 still count more than your vote? Don't waste your vote - be reasonable. (I am just tough to please, hence the 3 rating)",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

Not that I didn't love him before. but it would be annoying if he was like that this whole thing.

Negatives: Brie is unfortunately miscasted and her range of powers fluctuate wildly, as do the Skrulls and the Kree. And Fury's losing his eye scene was monumentally stupid.

The casting as per usual is near perfect, though Brief Larsons acting can be a bit over the top in one or two scenes. However she and the rest of the cast still do an amazing job besides that tiny note. The special effects are once again mind-blowing, especially the deaging of Samuel L. Jacksons character. The villain reveal isn't anything special, but they still serve their purpose, and they do it well. Seeing Clark Gregg's character make a return, even for just a few tiny scenes, is a fun cameo. The only thing of note in this film I did not enjoy was the reasoning as to why Nicholas Fury lost his eye, as in a preview installment he mentioned he lost his eye the last time he trusted someone. However in actuality he lost his eye when a cat looking alien scratched his eye. Besides that, this film is a fun addition to the MCU.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","If you were expecting a good comic action movie, you are going to be deeply disappointed. 90% of this movie is about acting stupid and anything unlike a woman. If this is what means to be a super woman (*cough* unlike Wonder Woman) then she is not qualified to represent a women's model as she shows no respect for any other human beings. This is a very narcissistic take on this character from the movie's point of view and all the focus is on the character instead of the plot. There is nothing remotely attractive about this movie in the sense of Marvel. It feels out of place and poorly directed. The other actors tried to balance this movie out but since they are in roughly 10% of the movie, I simply could not get the feeling that this is a movie worth recommending to anyone who likes the MCU. This movie should have been call Cat Woman 2 with a real cat lady.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","The amount of forced misogyny masking deep misandry is wall to wall. Literally every single male that appears in the movie is either a eye rolling misogynist or completely incompetent. The irony is the writing in this film in which it beats every male over the head with endless tones of bullying from only men and I'll show you (girl power moments), has already been debunked in practice by plenty of other films featuring other male heroes that don't exist in the twilight zone of the Captain Marvel universe that actually don't care the gender of their allies and have people generally acting like good and decent people like most decent people. The Avengers are supposed to be a team, a mixed team, the writers and producers of Captain Marvel didn't get the memo, they made the story all about intersectionalism. It was a constant barrage of scenarios of girls vs boys under a radical feminist filter. Don't surround yourself with yes-people when filming a film, or you'll assume you're making a sociological masterpiece, while in reality you're really condensing years of bitter memories and dogmatic opinions into a 2 hour science fiction movie.

","Firstly, for those of you who think that Disney are going to 'Last Jedi' the MCU, you don't have to worry - this movie is much much better. I hated 'The Last Jedi' and I can honestly say I really liked this movie. It isn't my favourite MCU movie by a long shot, but it is all the hallmarks we expect from the MCU - characters with depth, humour and a good storyline. This isn't a rah rah girl power movie, and instead tells the story of a determined and resilient woman. Brie Larson does a great and demonstrates the range and personality you'd expect of an MCU lead and Best Actress Oscar winner.
I am very surprised by the number of bad ratings on this movie as it hasn't come out in most countries yet, but what can you do?

Acting was good story was good , Brie Larson did smile in the movie many times .... In last 30 min it did seem a little rush rush but overall good suspense and nice watch .
Given the movie is definitely not as bad as people have made it , it seems clear
1. People see what they want to see , all those who came with very negative image of movie and lead actor saw a very flawed movie
2. They over exaggerated the flaws and even made up flaws like Brie was not smiling or not friendly
3. They even hated the story which was not that bad ...
It has the same flaws as wonder woman but wonder woman is sexy and showing legs and tonned arms ...
In wonder woman she single handedly kinda ends the world war and then there was a weird evil Greek god ... ???? That story made far less sense than captain marvel yet people seemed to like it a lot coz of sexy and beautiful super shero",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

1541,10 March 2019,brooke-murdock,9," This movie follows along well with the stories that have come before it
","I'm reading a lot of negative reviews and I don't understand why. A lot of people are bashing on a specific element of this movie: how it isn't relevant to the previous storylines and none in regards to the next phase. First off, Project Pegasus is referenced back in the very first Avengers movie. The place itself, in a remote mountain range in California is the same place we start off at in The Avengers Movie. That is where Shield is established and where it is monitoring the Tessaract. So that's one reference that is not only huge and fun if you are a fan, but points to facts and Easter eggs left for us in previous films. Second, the next phase is of course under wraps and who knows where it will go now that Fox and Marvel are in talks to bring all the characters under one roof, but you can be sure that another big storyline and joining of more characters on the big screen will happen. In this particular film Secret Wars comes to my mind as a possibility.
Third, as far as entertainment, consider me won over. This film can be an origin story for at least three characters and gives so many possibilities for the sequel (don't forget we never saw Minerva emerge from the wreckage and my bet is she will be the next villain for Captain Marvel to fight off). We get a glimpse into how the inspiration of the Avengers Initiative comes to be. This movie if the inspiration for what we already know will happen with IronMan, Capt. America, Thor, Hulk and company. Also we get to have Coulson make and see where he was at the beginning of his SHIELD days.
Brie Larson is what I hoped for as Captain Marvel. She imbodied this character well in the film. Anyone who has actually seen the film and who has read the comics of Captain Marvel can see that the casting for these characters is pretty spot on. I look forward to seeing where this story continues to go. And also I much appreciate that at the end of the film, the movie is dedicated to a Thunderbird pilot who died not to long ago.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","Captain Marvel has a lot of really cool action scenes, and a pretty compelling story. The one thing it seemed to be missing just so happened to be the one thing it was shooting for, A compelling Character. The audience never got to see Carol's motivations which resulted in us not caring for her as a character. We were shown numerous clips from her past of her falling down, but without the context, we don't know how to feel for her. I guess Marvel just hoped we would feel sympathetic without much work.

Pretty standard but told in cohesive, interesting way; very funny but also very touching in some parts. Good cinematography, though I will admit not very imaginative; nothing that would give the film a unique feel. I was pleased by Brie Larsson's portrayal of the character. She had a hard job to do considering the character of Marvel is not very well realized. We get just glimpses of how her personality is supposed to be from the falshbacks and then from Maria's and Monica's memories of her. Maybe they should have taken the time and showed a bit more from her life as Carol Danvers. But even though people might have a bit of trouble connecting with Carol's character i think they will enjoy her interactions with the rest of the cast. She plays really well with them and they're all amazing in their rolls.

","Captain Marvel has everything a good superhero movie needs: great origin story, relatable characters, great plot twists, funny jokes, a villain that can truly be hated, a hero that can truly be loved, and of course great action.
Brie Larson's portrayal of Carol Danvers made me love the character from the very beginning of the film. She makes Carol Danvers human. She makes it easy to relate to a character that is so powerful she's nearly invincible.
Captain Marvel is a great film that everyone should see. I have already seen it twice and loved every second of it. It is by far my favourite marvel movie and Carol Danvers is now my favourite marvel character.
(Even if you're too stuck up to be able to like a strong female superhero, you should see this film. If not for Carol Danvers, then for Goose the cat, or if you want to know how Nick Fury lost his eye.)",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","This movie was so boring and cut and paste. I tried. I really tried to like it but Brie Larson is by far the worst thing to come from the MCU since the horrible reveal about the Mandarin. She is so smug the entire time and completely emotionless. I know she is trying to come off as the new Iron man ""I guess"" but it just comes across as a rich white girl that screams girl power when her daddy tells her shes pretty. All of this combined with terrible puns and jokes that made it all to obvious who the real bad guys where ""Men"" with jokes like ""you know why they call it a Cockpit right?"".. Its to much. If this is the future of the MCU then Marvel has a bad time ahead of them. Feels like they didnt learn when they made their comic sales tank after turning everything into a Political campaign to erase everything they made in favor of a more PC Universe. Captain Marvel will never be a replacement for any of the Original Characters in the MCU even new ones that lasted one movie ""Quick Silver"" where far better in every way to the train wreck Brie Larson is bringing.....",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

Strength comes in many forms and true power must display strength on many levels for us to respect such as Thanos. In the case of Captain Marvel and Brie Larson, there is no connection that is formed that makes us respect and cheer for the character. Brie Larson is a person who does not and cannot convey those sentiments that project those qualities that most would deem ""super"" . There is no real charisma in how she portrays the character portrays, just a brash self appeasing angry narcissistic person.

Marvel has gotten way too political wanting to be good with the Devil and God when they should've kept it with the current cast.

","I'm very sure that many of the people who went to see the movie somehow miss the fact that Captain Marvel does not know what she is.
""she showed ZERO range in this"" was one of the many phrases people use to critique the brilliant actress, Brie Larson. The Kree Empire simply wishes her to contain her emotion, rather hide it as they thought that emotions should not be expressed due to it showing their weaknesses or in a sense, make them weaker. Hence, Brie Larson has perfectly captured the emotions of a human who has been suppressing their emotions as they were taught that expressing your feelings makes you weak.
The ""ZERO"" range of emotion is an exaggeration, the range of emotion is limited but shouldn't we take in consideration of how it is suitable towards the plot? If you were taught to be ruthless, emotionless, would you be crying rivers of tears?
Furthermore, many watched this movie with the mindset that it is gonna suck because an active feminist actress is in it. This is not going to work, if you have watched and reviewed it without having an open-mind, your review is not going to be valid. Personally, I was not hyped about the film due to the overload amount negative comments from people who are anti-feminists, however, when I decided to give it a go, it has ticked many boxes for me.

Personally, as someone who went to both high school and college in the 90's, the soundtrack rocked (pun intended). It was a brilliant move to have the majority of the soundtrack have strong female vocals with a heavy grunge influence. I would say that this movie felt more like the first part of a trilogy and because it laid a solid foundation of her origin story, it was not as action packed as other movies (for example, Black Panther). However, I feel this was very necessary as people are not as familiar with Captain Marvel.

She with Dr. Lawson mentors & originator of a power core that produces light speed capabilities is taken out for a test drive & winds up somehow a galactic tug of war. Though this much power can only be harnessed by a certain species not from this planet. When the truth be told, we discover why humans are on planet c35 & this oncoming civilization is pursing.
The avengers origin of the 5 w's - who, what, where, when, & why continue to produce these powerhouse histories. A great many big ups to the this imaginative #10 Sirius status himself Stan Lee (get @ me @ Frida cinema in Santa Ana, Orange County, CA.)

""1 thumb up, 1 thumb down"" (Siskel & Ebert). Really enjoy the light speed with the jets. More realistic until it is discovered by humans or given. With her hands of fury, this captain is capable of much more than keeping the peace. Finding out her past as a local as well is unearthed & finally gets her back on the moral compass. Though yon-rogg has been with vers since her re-inception, he is sworn to protect his homeland which becomes a battle for new information.

","Captain Marvel is one of the more controversial films in the MCU and, what with Endgame having just been released, I thought now would be the perfect time to write this review. I don't mind this movie, honestly. I feel like it has great acting from Brie Larson and Samuel L Jackson. I don't like Brie Larson that much as a person, but I can't deny that she's a good actress. (She won an oscar after all) The stand out performance in this movie, however, was Ben Mendelson. Ben Mendelson's character is the best one on the movie. This movie's depiction of the skrulls bring a clever twist on established comic book lore. I also enjoyed Captain Marvel's story in this movie, while some she she doesn't have much of an arc, I disagree, but to explain why I'd have to spoil the movie, which I do not wish to do. What I didn't enjoy about this film was it's depiction of Nick Fury, he's a completely different character than in other Marvel films and doesn't even change into the character we knew in Phase 1. I also found Jude Law's character to be rather bland, which is a shame because he's very important to the movie. Finally, I didn't like that cat. That cat is single pawedly responsible for the stupidest scene in the MCU to date. So for all those reasons, I believe this film deserves a 7/10. I didn't enjoy it as much as other MCU films, but it's worth your time and I recommend you check it out before seeing Avengers: Endgame.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

Capitain Marvel is fantastic!! Brie Larson does a nice job playing as Carol Danvers, Sam Jackson also does very well playing as a younger Nick Fury and I really enjoyed the Skrull leader Talos.
Also, the visual effects are incredible and the action scenes are really nice. I just don't give a ten because I believe the action scenes could have been more exciting, like in Infinity War, but it was good enough for me.
Resuming: Capitain Marvel is an action-packed movie that may not be as epic as IW and Civil War, but it holds your attention the full time and introduces the most powerful character in the MCU, who is gonna kick Thanos's ass in Avengers: Endgame!

","First of all I am a huge Marvel fan, and I do have huge expectations when it comes to them making movies and so far they have done a superb job at making movies and creating their cinematic universe. I am never given any Marvel movie a negative review with the exception of Black Panther and now will be my very first time giving a Marvel movie a one star because I truly believe this movie was completely ruined, and not just by a single aspect of the film but by quite a few aspects of the film. First of all, let me start by saying Brie Larson is a great actress but unfortunately I do not believe she did an excellent job at portraying Carol Danvers, who knows perhaps it was the director's fault and maybe they wanted Brie to portray Carol a certain way. Nevertheless, it was a very poor job. 2nd aspect was the story. Nick Fury's attempt to be comedic some what ruined his character and the consistency regarding his behaviour. If you've watched every single Marvel film out there which included Nick Fury, none of them were comedic. His character on this film reminded me of Jar Jar Binks from Star Wars which was eventually removed due to negative feedback from fans. 3rd, the cat or flurkin. Now I understand that this is a fictional film but how that a creature like a cat/flurkin become powerful enough to swallow a Tesseract when it took an enitre Guardians of the Galaxy team to hold one which included Star Lord in which during the film was a half human half god.

I had the impression of a well-prepared cast that dominated the repertoire with ease. We can see an incredible work of authors and directors Anna Baden and Ryan Fleck and among others involved, and a great film that repercutiu diverse information and development.

","This was definitely the weakest of all the 22 Marvel movies to date. At the rock bottom of the list. It was arguably the one that deviated the most from the comic book source material (and not in the same good way that Civil War, Ragnarok, Age of Ultron, Iron Man 3, and Spiderman did); had the least character depth and development, particularly with Captain Marvel herself; had the weakest direction, lighting, writing, pacing, musical score, sound effects, etc. Nick Fury is diminished to basically being the comic relief for a lead who has only 3 emotional ranges the entire movie: frustrated, snarky, and confused. Action scenes are poorly choreographed, dimly lit, and shot in that shaky camera ""you're-part-of-the-fight"" style that's basically guaranteed to make the viewer not know what the heck is happening. So many plot holes that are so huge, you could fly a hundred quinjets through them. By the end, the audience wasn't cheering and clapping (remember toward the end of the first Avengers movie where Hulk tosses Lori around like a rag doll?), but were groaning, shaking their heads, whispering ""wtf"" under their breaths, and checking their phones to see how much more of the movie was left.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","Schrewd Blockbuster filmmaking here.
All the situations seemed amazingly fresh even though it did have a 90s (and even 80s) tone in its design.
Inventive, within the Marvel cinematic style and more so for possibly not having an Avengers-sized budget.
All the performances are committed across the board and there is an entertaining mix of characters.
The effects aren't mind-blowing in themselves but they are mind-buzzing. Combined with an intelligently-paced lead performance, the result is an emphatic finale in my books.
Not sure what the effect of having a male-female duo directing this film but it was more light-hearted but not taken lightly, if you get my drift. A good balance. I'm not hugely into these interconnected films but it did seem to work in quite well with the other Marvel franchises. Yes, see it on the biggest screen you can. EDIT: saw it second time - clever use of the genre. Good action sequences all round even if some underlit a tad and things get a little too fast occasionally. Hand2hand combat scenes the most 'sensicle' I've seen in a non-martial arts movie. Ironically, the trailers referred to Carol Danvers falling down several times throughout her life whilst, sheesh, Marvel lands on her feet almost as good as Selene at the start of Underworld.

She's grounded and real, and very relatable because of that - a character I could connect with. On top of that, the movie never hits you over the head with its mid-nineties references, but still fully brings to life that time period, and the nostalgia feels it evokes are wonderful.

Maybe they're just sad that the haven't been invited to the meetings. I legitimately don't know.
There is a slight uneveness in tone, the bits with Nick Fury and the cat. The fact that they use the usual tropes. But apart from that, they finally start tying up some loose ends to the whole Marvel saga. I went home and wanted to watch everything from scratch as the whole thing started making more sense, by explaining the actions of some of the earlier villains.
The music was pure 90s fun. Although their choices were sometimes a little obvious.

In my opinion, Larson did a fantastic job in the title role, she was able to perfectly portray Carol's moments of vulnerability and power while still keeping in mind that this character was brainwashed by aliens. She also did a great job of bringing life to this character through the way her dialogue was delivered and the use of facial expressions. This movie made me fall in love with the character in all forms that she took, whether she was a member of starforce, a recovering Carol Danvers, and of course, the mighty Captain Marvel. Not only was it nice to see an atypical superhero origin story that involved a woman, but the way it was carried out couldn't have been better!

","I never review movies but after reading the other reviews I felt like I had to. Mind you, I don't actually think this movie is a 10/10, maybe more of an 8, but it certainly should rank higher than all the one star reviews. I only just watched this movie because I saw so much negativity about it (although I saw a lot of positivity too on social media) that I was worried I would hate it and feel let down. On a whim I decided yesterday to watch it, having just gotten Disney plus. After watching it I can safely say I've never been more confused by IMDb reviews in my whole life. Some I can dismiss, all the people who are angry with ""political propaganda"" who seem weirdly threatened by a non-sexualized strong female character with no love interest. But others who claim that didn't bother them just confuse me. Some say Brie Larson underplayed her character and that her character had no character development and I really don't know where they got that from because not only was her Carol Danvers likable and interesting, but the emotional turmoil and growth she went through in the film was easily the best part of the movie. In terms of action scenes, I don't know how anyone could get bored. It had the thrill of the triumphant hero after being knocked down so many times, it had star wars-esque flying fight sequences that have you on the edge of your seat, and it had interesting villains that really made you think. Yeah obviously the movie isn't incredibly deep or clever. It's a marvel movie for goodness sake. It's fun and entertaining and just deep enough to make you feel good about watching it.

","Marvel have done a quite decent movie for Captain Marvel. The plot is generic enough. The humor is good, mostly because of Nick Fury, Goose and Skrull characters. The drama is quite good also, I can see the developing dynamic between Nick Fury and Carol Danvers, the strong bond between Maria Rambeau and Carol, and the shifting power-play interaction between Yon Rogg (team leader of Carol's Kree team) and Carol. Quite clever of Marvel for telling us how Nick Fury lost his eye (not expecting that but kinda fits). Also about who is the real villain in the movie, I know from the start of movie that some character have ""not-the-good-guy"" vibe. Still I kinda feel blindsided of the Skrulls who the real motive are to reunite with their estranged family (not excusing the bad things that they done and it make them look villainny at the start of the movie). But for me it's quite an achievement since the woman in this movie is not become only an object (not as male sidekick or reduced as romantic interest or as sexual object). This movie putting into perspective how woman often treated by society. And since its a heroine movie, in the end of course she saves the day.

I'm currently in the process of doing the Marvel Movie Marathon I'm anticipation of Endgame, and the premise of all the films is the exact same, but it's the way in which the story is told and how each actor fulfills their role as the protagonist. RDJ, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth etc all do a great job, you actually believe these people are REAL superheroes and this is due to their acting ability. Then there's Captain Marvel.. Brie Larson just doesn't suit the role! She's not a convincing superhero, it's almost like Captain Marvel is a movie about a bad actor trying to play a superhero.. it just doesn't work, she doesn't work. There's a scene that stands out where she's talking to Jude Law's character on some form of transportation and she's bragging about her abilities and holds up her fist and in that moment I am reminded of a child when they flex their muscles.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

Yes, yes she is but honestly she gets her powers more or less the same way scarlet witch does and she seems to be on the same scale for powers, so I'm cool with that. Before hand it seemed like a lot of people had agendas for this movie other then making something to entertain people, including Brie Larson herself, but thankfully it seemed like that was completely left at the door. The marketing and larson's comments made it seem like this movie was going to promoting extremist feminist ideas, it didn't.

So I put on my big kid pants and actually gave this movie a shot. And guess what folks? The film wasn't terrible. Dare I say, it was actually very good. Nothing particularly spectacular or groundbreaking, but good nonetheless. I thought the makeup, effects, and fight choreography was stellar. The movie ran at a decent pace, I was actually engaged in the story and wasn't quite sure what was going to happened next. Marvel managed to another villain with a good twist that is actually entertaining and even sympathetic with their plight. Brie Larson does a fine job portraying the marvelous captain. I don't understand how people say that Brie's performance is wooden and compare her to ScarJo's Black Widow when there hasn't been a single memorable or interesting scene of MCU Black Widow other than her introduction scene in Iron Man 2 (also let's be real ScarJo has the emotional range of a baby wipe).
The dynamic between Fury and Danvers is great, I was surprised how well these two played off each other. The friendship between Carol and Maria was also well done and felt genuine. I loved the message of how Carol's humanity is what truly makes her strong, thwt how even though we may fall; getting back up is what matters.

I am at a total lost for words as to how they could screw this up so badly, seeing as though all their other movies were so good. I have been pondering in my mind as to what is the worst thing about Captain Marvel since there are so many worst things. I have boiled it down to three. #3 is the acting, it lacks everything except awfulness. #2 is the directing, this movie was directed my children. #1 is Brie Larson, no personality, no charisma, no fun, no life, no style, no charm, no understanding of the character or of comic book movies. This movie should drop between 60 and 80 percent in its 2nd week of release. Justice League was so horrible that it should have made no more than $350 million worldwide in its entire run. Captain Marvel should do no better than $400 million in its entire run. It will make much more but it shouldn't. This movie is absolute proof that Marvel can fail and they have.

The only 'but' is: the story is fast and doesn't give you time to assimilate it, besides that I think some parts need more development time,but it still works thanks to the chemistry. The Captain Marvel's origin story is so different from the typical structure (get the powers - learn to control them - something emotional happens - unleashes the full potential of the powers) that has been new and fascinating in addition to the mix between a start with science fiction environment and for later the 90' atmosphere.
I love the fact that it has a deep-rooted reflection on the female experience and it doesn't hide it, it's brave for marvel to make a superhero film about women's experience so honest, it personally touched me deeply I think it is the only movies of this genre that made me feel this way...

I just couldn't get to that point and I felt like this was a great marvel movie. Even a good one. This knocked the dark elves up a few notches. You figure marvel would have learned. Even though they will probably make millions, I'll never watch this movie again. There is no draw, no excitement. The movie just didn't seemed written well or directed for most of it. Yes Brie was wooden, but maybe that was how are was directed to be? Want a movie pushing that everyone can see themselves in a character, great. But, isn't good acting-writing-directing the point that people see past what's just on the outside of a person? This movie, it felt like I was watching the third episode of a season. That there was so much more that should have been told before we got to this point. For so much it felt like this wasn't a movie, but something shot for TV. There is a difference and I don't think they knew. The end scene should have happened a lot earlier. It just all felt sloppy and rushed. It's like they never heard of Joseph Campbell and how a hero tell is made. Where is the journey a hero has to go through to get to that point they are one. That's basic. Why am I going to root for her? I don't get it. Also, weren't they not calling it shield in one of the earlier movies, but in this one they were at an earlier time? Jackson calls it shield twice in here. It just isn't on caliber with what a marvel movie could be.

","My wife and I saw the film and be both have the same review. Movie was fine, it was just a movie, it was not bad, it was entertaining for sure but definitely not great. With that being said this film was for sure the worst Marvel film but only because MCU films are typically great or incredibly great and this movie was neither so by default it was the worst one. Best we can come up with is that Captain Marvel was like an episode of Agents of Shield with slightly better CGI.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019
2025,7 May 2019,rbd3000,8," Another win for Marvel..
","I liked Captain Marvel. It manages to feel like the early origin films of the MCU with a simpler style and less flashy in your face action of the more recent entries. It battles through a uneven, exposition heavy first act to settle into a quicker pace that led to many twists and turns and several comedy bits that worked for me. Samuel L. Jackson, returning as a younger Nick Fury, steals every scene he's in and is clearly having the most fun he's had in the role since The Avengers. Brie Larson works in the title role, opting for a low key approach to the character but builds it into a worthy hero as she develops her superpowers. I was on the fence after initial footage was shown but seeing her go full Marvel was a treat and I liked her in the role. She brought to it a quirky little attitude that will fit in nicely with Tony Stark and Peter Quill, and be different from the stoic nature of the Avengers other resident Captain. Ben Mendelsohn and Jude Law both work in their respective roles, rounding out a great cast that all had their moments to shine. The directing team of Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, whose previous work on Mississippi Grind didn't exactly shout big budget comic book movie but they're serviceable here, never going too big and keeping the action fairly light in the most dialogue heavy MCU film since the first Captain America. A more action focused filmmaking team might have opted for a bigger splash but this approach worked for Captain Marvel's first big screen adventure, setting her up for a fuller showcase in future films, of which she figures to feature prominently moving forward. It was a fun lead on to Endgame, which is really all I was wanting, and nicely introduced a new major character without showing too much and leaving me wanting to see more of her in future films.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","I went into this movie with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Don't think it is just a coincidence that this movie was released on International Woman's Day. An empowering movie, with stunning visuals and a captivating storyline. Carol Danvers is the female superhero we all need. Admittedly, it took a while to really kick off and there were moments that dragged, but the action packed scenes and the humorous dialogue balanced it out. Whilst not in Winter Soldier's league, it is definitely one of Marvel's better ones, with a strong storyline and is a movie that sends a very powerful message - you can achieve what you wish to and you do not have to prove yourself to anybody.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

Brie Larson is underwhelming, which is unfortunate because she is such a good actress. She came off stiff throughout the whole movie. To be fair, I have not read the comic books.

","THE LOW-DOWN: It's been a long, slightly ludicrous time in coming, but Marvel Studios' first female-led superhero movie is finally blasting into cinemas. Unfortunately, Captain Marvel is trailing plenty of controversy in its wake, largely generated by the same toxic, sexist segments of 'fandom' who have been venting their rage online about 'their' franchises being taken over by women. (See: Ghostbusters, Star Wars etc.) It's quite wonderful, then, that Captain Marvel is (literally and figuratively) the most powerful response to these haters yet - not only is it a ton of fun, this film is unapologetically, explicitly feminist in a way that's never before been presented on screen in such a mainstream blockbuster.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

It is ""just"" an origin movie and therefore it can't be compared to the Avengers but should rather be compared to IM 1 for example.

","Captain Marvel... hmmm. Well, you may have seen all the ""controversy"" surrounding this film involving bad advance reviews based on some foolish statements made by Brie Larson in the press that were blown wayyyy out of proportion. The expectation that it would be a relentless, hardcore feminist diatribe left many fans disinterested in seeing the film. After seeing it, I can tell you that there is quite a bit of feminist/girl power messaging in play, but it's the type of shallow, corporate, glad-handing that's going to leave actual feminists angry more than anyone else.
Any scenes of Danvers' actual life or character development? You've seen them all in the trailer.
The problem with Captain Marvel is that, while not being the WORST film in the MCU oeuvre, it is by far the most BORING. Stultifying, even.
Larson's performance is so mind numbing and dull I started to wonder if she was actually a robot or clone that someone hit with a cattle prod off camera to induce some kind of jerky pseudo smile or other simulated snark. Simply awful.
Jackson is OK as Fury, simply along for the ride playing the sidekick role (although the cat jokes get tired fast).
The Starforce, one of the lamest creations of 90s Marvel, makes a seamless transition achieving the same level of ""who gives a s#!t"" that you would expect from a set of pathetic, low rent Guardians knock-offs.
The Skrulls. Oh boy, we finally get real Skrulls! One of the biggest threats in the Galaxy!!! Annnnnd, you ruined them... that was fast.
The effects in some scenes were OK, but large chunks of the film exuded such ""cheapness"" that I was wondering if I was watching the Inhumans again. And it was inconsistent. While Samuel L Jackson looked great in his CGI de-aged state, Clark Gregg looked like he was sculpted out of wax at times.
Not sure what else to say about such an uninspired product.

","So I am a 70's baby early 80's child. I grew up on goonies, lost boys, stand by me, and reading comics. So when they started making these characters come to life with the MCU and making iron man, Thor, hulk the whole avengers team I was excited. Of course you're going to get the critics and people they just want to say they don't like to get a reaction. I've liked all the movies they created, some more than others but as movies alone they are great, movies full of action, emotion, cinematic genius and visual effects. I truly thought Captain Marvel was GREAT! It's hard to go back to one of the beginnings again like Captain America. But we need this for the new Avengers. It was a beautiful film, and a great introduction for her character. And thoroughly enjoyed it.

","This is easily ranks among one of the best origins movie for a marvel character. I wont rank it with the ironman's or black panther's origins movie, coz they have a legendary status. But on the other hand it is definitely better than thor's or cap's origins movie. I see absolutely no sense in why the american public or the media have had the fun in disgracing this awesome movie via memes and nasty mean comments. This movie has the right amount of humour, storyline and a perfect placement in the timeline of MCU. It perfectly bonds between the cap's first avenger movie and the ironman 1. Just watch it for nick fury's character arc. Honestly speaking, if you are a true marvel fan and love to watch marvel movies, you will enjoy this movie just like you did guardians of galaxy 1 and antman 1. It is indeed that good.
To all the haters just hating on brie larson's lack of facial expressions: guys she has done it perfectly with regards to her character development. Imagine having a past that you dont remember and being a person with no connection to who you are, how and why you exist, etc. Her character basically is totally confused of her existence and purpose.

I have watched MCU from the beginning and have loved the journey. At the end of the movies, I have felt that I watched something that has left me feeling, excited.
Well, that did not happen today when I saw Captain Marvel. I felt flat and indifferent.
Carol Danvers was the same at end and she was in the beginning. Carol did not inspire me at all. Carol was boring. I was never invested in carol Danvers at all.
Sure some parts were ok. Nick Fury, Phil Coulson, Maria Rambeau, Monica Rambeau were great characters. Yon-Rogg or as I will call him Yawn-Rogg.
If fact pretty much the whole movie is a yawn.
The fight scene with No Doubt's I'm just a Girl music choice is sad. They could have gone with Pat Benatar's Hit me with your best shot.
After watching YouTube (yes I know) I discovered that one of the first Captain Marvel was a woman of colour. Why, did they not cast a women of colour. Black Panther showed the way to inspire people, me included. But, no they missed a huge opportunity and went with a safe bet on a white woman.
If you want to see the mid credit scene, don't waste your time. Watch the mid credit scene on YouTube.

","This was a great movie, and it definitely doesn't deserve all the hate it is getting. It got off to a rocky start in the first act story wise, but once it got going it really began to shine. I have never seen a theatre laugh as hard as we did at some of the amazingly funny scenes/jokes. People are complaining that Brie Larson doesn't show enough ""emotion"" or ""acting"". First of all, she has an Oscar for best actress, and second of all, she plays a serious character, so of course she is going to look serious. I loved her performance in this movie, her pure seriousness and unwavering focus was a well structured character trait. She was witty and sarcastic, and still had the expected emotional journey in super hero film. And I would like to say this, nobody would ever complain if a male actor was acting serious in his role. People are also desperately trying to blame the movie for being to ""brazenly feminist"", but it's really not. It has empowerment and character development that would fit into any male or female character. It does an amazing job of empowering a female character not by cramming negative views of men down your throat, but simply by changing the gender of the superhero story arch to show that a female fits into the role just as well as any man could. I think subconsciously a lot of people are going in thinking they are supposed to not like this movie because of the unwarranted thrashing it has received, which leaves them predisposed toward a negative opinion of it. This movie was smart, far more funny than I expected, engaging, extremely entertaining, and well filmed and performed. I would recommend anyone I know to go see it. The one big issue I would have is how extremely powerful she is, to the point that it doesn't seem like anything could ever hope to stop her, which creates an issue with the movies stakes and tension. It is also important to note that this issue is kind of addressed by the fact that the movie primarily focuses on her past and self discovery, not trying to defeat an all powerful enemy. This prevents her overpowered abilities from crippling the story because the story focuses a lot on the other aspects of her character.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

The movie also moved pretty slow, there were times where it felt like scenes were just dragging on. This movie had its flaws, but it also did well in some other areas. I liked how this movie had some pretty strong ties with The Guardians of the Galaxy. We got to see Lee Pace reprise his role as Ronan, and Djimon Hounsou reprise his role as Korath. This movie also centered around the Kree race who were the main antagonists in The Guardians of the Galaxy. I also liked how for the first time since 2012, we got to see Coulson back in the MCU.

I had low expectations walking in. I did not think it would be that good because the trailer made it seem like it was the Marvel version of Green Lantern. The middle of the movie completely ditches heavy visual effects in trade for a rousing 90s storyline with good character discoveries. Good acting all around some great 90s music. One of the best Stan Lee's cameos, showing tidbit of him in relation to Mallrats which was released in 1995.

It just felt wrong, I truly thought Marvel, of all people, would know how to write a good female protagonist with good motivation but nope.

And fans who compare it with the comic books should for once just judge it like a movie and also MCU is always different from the comic book stories as far as I know... They just get inspiration from the comic books.... At the end I would say one must go for it and do rate this movie if you like it ...

The movie is great and has an aspect of great humour to it, this is a really unforgettable movie with all its answers to backgrounds and stories about our favourite characters. Goose, the cat, was a great addition to the movie. The movie is a great watch and is great timing to release on international women's day. This empowering movie is great for young women to aspire to, with the idea of becoming a pilot is for both sexes and sometimes the struggles women had with becoming a pilot. Captain Marvel gives a lot of detail to what will happen in Avengers: Endgame and the movie really wants you to look forward to Endgame. The tribute to Stan Lee is lovely and credit to Marvel for the moving and emotional tribute. The movie is also really funny and laughs were shared in the cinema, they were not cringey or forced, just genuinely funny.

","I have just come home from the 8:40pm showing of Captain Marvel with my friends, the prelude to which was full of jubilance, food, drink and atmospheric wonder one would expect from a night out. This was brought to a screeching halt as the film started.
I have found myself sitting in the aisles of many a superhero flick over the past decade, but I found nothing as soulless, contrived and pitiful as this. Captain Marvel is what happens when a brand decides that they have reached its peak, that the inclusion of famous names and a recognisable IP is enough to fill seats. The plot was what one might expect when scriptwriting enters the realm of monotonous Nike-assembly-slave-labour, largely comprised of ""and then"" moments, which entail characters jumping from one plot point to another with seemingly tenuous links only glued together through pithy dialogue and humour about as forced as consent in Neverland Ranch. This skipped exposition, beyond what served to necessitate the progression of the story, instead ended up dancing from one CGI riddled fight sequence to another. I had heard a lot about politics, but that rarely if ever impacts a film to me. It didn't here either. The acting was solid across the board, but if I was presented with this husk of a film under any ordinary circumstances, I would have lit it on fire and stomped it out, leaving it on the doorstep of someone whom I truly, truly despised. Costume design might have well just retained the green glow prior to editing, the generic shade that eclipsed what could have otherwise been a nice touch to the acting might have added some semblance of decency if left untouched.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

To be fair the whole ""empowering women"" theme is not too in your face (although it's a little disturbing that pretty much all the male characters are either villains or idiots, like a completely out of character Nick Fury now turned stooge and comic relief for the powerful amazon from outer space)....
But really it's just a poorly written script (one chase after another with no real character building or sophistication), and a poorly acted movie (especially by Brie Larsen, who walks around with a perennially dazed expression probably meaning that she still doesn't really get what kind of character she's supposed to portray).

2243,6 April 2019,fernanda_lais,8," Confusing at first and surprising at the end.It's worth seeing.
","Watching the movie Captain Marvel I noticed that the film starts with a certain confusion, but throughout the film everything aligns and the previous information connects. The movie has many twists and turns and after the beginning the movie begins to catch the viewer. I consider the script to be good, but it does not have a great history, based on the information given.
Brie Larson's acting is excellent, charismatic, engaging, beautiful, talented are so many words to describe her acting in the film. She won the Academy Award for Best Actress in 2016 for Jack's Room, who lives the heroine in the movies. At his side we have a cast including Jude Law as Yon-Rogg, Ben Mendelsohn as General Talos and the more than welcome return of Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury. I think the best scene was when Carol remembered her friend, it was exciting.
The special effects of the film are wonderful, we could not expect less from Marvel, every blast was perfect with a great sound effect, and every ray of light from the film was worked out in the smallest details.
The film is good, has a story as striking as the other Marvel movies but served as a bridge to the film ultimatum avengers because it had two post-movie scenes that revealed subjects about the film. It has an excellent cast, with the empowered, strong and brave Carol Angers performed by Brie Larson. Its special effects are breathtaking and I say the same about the sounds. Concluding the movie is good but does not have a remarkable story but it is important because it tells the story of our beloved Captain Marvel.
Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) was a member of the US Air Force, but she did not remember her life on earth and is summoned by the Kree and ends up being part of their elite army. She was considered a great enemy of the Skrulls, and one day she ends up returning to her home planet to prevent an invasion of the metaphor, and in this way she discovers the truth about herself and her past, with the help of Agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and the cat Goose.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

During the process, she mentioned that people who are ""white men"" shouldn't be interested in the film and it is not for them. Which explained the big backlash against the audience's scores. I am not biased towards the film. I have actual reasons I disliked the film. One of my favourite things about the movie was the Skrulls and Nick Fury. Most of Nick's CGI was just makeup with a little bit of CGI. He still looks awesome. He had a more humorous role in the film. Nick lost his eye from a cat. I knew this was going to happen, and I would've been fine with. But reflecting upon it... it was so stupid. Many times in the MCU he has menacingly stood there and said: ""The last time I trusted someone, I lost an eye"". As if there were a huge story behind. He was a fun character still.

However this is completely contradictory to the theme throughout the movie where her one weakness is that she lets her emotions control her actions. As human beings I think we can all agree that she does not need to show her emotions in order to be feeling them.

","So. Guys. I've seen the trailers, thought ""man, this looks kinda bad"". Brie Larson looked annoying, the CGI awful, I went into the cinema just to get it over with - shes's gonna be in Endgame, so I had to watch it, right?
And. I was wrong. I owe them all an apology.
I was prepared to see a bad movie with mediocre acting, but I didn't. OK, so it's MY opinion, but I liked it, LOVED it, even!
The last Marvel movie I watched was Venom (which was so bad it was kinda embarrassing), so I was SO sure that Marvel ran out of good origin-stories, but. No. For me, it was a refreshing experience - sure, the CGI had kinda low quality sometimes (sorry, Goose), but the story is unpredictable, the jokes are funny, and - I repeat, for me - Carol is a likeable, strong character.
I'm gonna be honest, she annoyed me in the trailers because of her face - I mean c'mon, can't she smile or something? Look anything but slightly frowny/condescending? I totally understand if for someone, that looks like bad acting, but as I was sitting in the theatre, I realised that I can relate to her, 'cos I have the same, ""I-hate-the-world-and-everything-in-it""-face if I don't smile. So, sorry, Brie, I was wrong.
The thing I liked the most about her character, though, was the ability to stand up after every fall. No, Carol isn't a perfect human being (...spoilers, kinda?), she can behave arrogantly and has a smug smile that you won't like, but she's strong, determined, and never gives up, no matter what the world throws at her - and THAT is something I admire in her.
So guys, I think everyone should see for themselves and decide whether to like it or not, but I was pleasantly surprised - seriously, I can't wait to watch it again.
On the other side, the action scenes are still unbelievably wobbly, I simply don't understand why they have to shake the camera so much, I always have a hard time following who is kicking whose ass...
And, oh, my biggest problem, and here comes the real spoiler: Fury lost his eye because of a cat (flerken, whatever)?! And not in a ""I-am-fighting-for-my-life"" scene, but in a ""I-wanna-coo-at-the-cute-alien-oww-my-eye"" one, which, no... That was slightly undignified, and don't start me on the second post-credit scene, because, no. I'm gonna go and pet my cats, and you should go and watch the movie, because seriously, it isn't as bad as they say.

","In the 1960s, one of the Marvel comics sagas I liked the most was the arrival of officer Kree Mar-Vell to spy on Earth and his evolution into one of the most powerful superheroes. The relationship with Carol Danvers-Miss Marvel was also interesting.
None of that is present in this production.
This Captain Marvel must be the worst superhero movie of this century, fighting over the podium of thash cinema with historical super-fiascos like Supergirl, Barbwire, Catwoman and Batman and Robin.
The first 30 minutes are even passable, the Kree strike group has its moments, but soon the blonde statue that tries to bring to life the heroic character of Carol Danvers take the whole screen and destroys the movie. Impossible to enjoy the performance of Brie Larson, which ends up contaminating the appreciation of the script. And then this script becomes increasingly ridiculous, as the so called importance of a light-speed engine for civilizations that have ships that jump thousands of light years through hyperspace. Fury's playful description is infuriating, as also is the Skrull agent who resembles more a poor buffoon than the menacing comic book villains.
By the end, the captain goes where no bad actors has gone before to help the homeless skrulls for the next 2 decades or so...

","Captain Marvel is another great superhero origin story for MCU. The story follows Captain Marvel as a extraterrestrial Kree warrior who finds herself in the middle of a ongoing battle with her forces and beings known as Skrulls. When a mission goes sideways and she ends up on earth in 1995 , she teams up with S. H. I. E. L. D. agent Nick Fury to uncover the Skulls plot that also might lead her to believe she's lived another life on earth as fighter pilot Carol Danvers. First off, Brie Larson as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel is one of the best casting choices to come to the MCU in a long time and is one of the best castings of Phase 3 of the MCU. Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury is great as well, portraying the CGI younger version of the character. Ben Mendelsohn as Talos is definitely one of the standout characters of the entire film and helps shapes it into what it is. The least favorite character of the film for me was Jude Law's Yon-Rogg. It wasn't necessarily his performance, but more of the source material that is given to him. Lashana Lynch as Maria Rambeau is really great and I wished we had gotten a little more of her character. Annette Bening as Wendy Lawson/ Mar-Vell was having fun with every scene she was in. Overall, Captain Marvel is a great introduction for the character Captain Marvel into the MCU while also giving us a glimpse of what's coming ahead for the MCU.

Now cut ahead to early 2000's and Now Ms. Marvel who was a very human character that got powers from a Kree and became pretty strong was now called Captain Marvel. She wasn't the strongest or the smartest but she had a great heart. Now in comics as well as in the movie I feel like they force feed this character to be nothing but a symbol. Her humanity was taken in this movie just like the last comic series and instead she was filled with anger or disinterest. Men evil women good. Let's make her more powerful then a god...check, no weaknesses...check, ignore a character that was already built to be able to take on a god (Scarlet Witch) because... check, ohh female SuperMan (Not WW because she was not unstoppable)...Check, let's force feed her to the masses and call them sexiest if they disagree...check.

Needless to say, I've grown up on superhero movies. However, this one was special - it's the first of the Marvel movies to have a female lead. Not that I don't love Black Widow, Scarlet Witch, or Zuri, but it's different having an actual female as the lead.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

The only complaint I have is the overuse of 90s music. I think the original music used for the movie would've been more effective but that's the MCU's biggest problem.

Brie Larson has done a good job and her chemistry with Nick Fury was natural. The plot was not complicated and unravelled pretty fast. The action bit was decent and kept up its end. This character could have been developed properly like Iron man or Thor, sadly the forced nature of tie in with Avenger's endgame resulted in this slightly rushed origin story. However, it was refreshing to watch the origin of the first female superhero of MCU and the message this movie delivers.

So this movie is basically not about storytelling any more, but about pushing certain agendas and politics.

","Im just coming back from the cinema and Im amazed by this movie, and this is my nerdy review. The movie stays true to its comic book origins without getting into the same problems that I had with Thor Ragnarok or Black Panther. Ragnarok didnt use its villain very well, and Black Panther had the most basic end fight with the villain by having two Panthers fight each other. Captain Marvel comes to a more satisfying conclusion that reminded me of that Darth Vader scene in Rogue One. Just show how badass the character is. No artificial back and forth. I can see that many people already see Cap Marvel as a 'Mary Sue'. But shes not more of a Mary Sue as Son Gokus entrance on Namek. Cap Marvel in the movie is possibly the first Marvel hero that comes close to the powerlevel of her comic book counter part. I hope this means we will see more of the really crazy Marvel Stuff in the future. From the first trailers I was afraid that Bries acting might be as bland as the acting by that girl from Twilight, but Brie actually showed a great range and I love the humor she conveyed. It was not at all in any way bland! The movie is a great action trip with many likeable characters and a well told story akin to the early X-Men comics.

Overall, it did a good job of setting the expectations for the character and introduced her to the mythos using a great tone. Marvel has a way of putting a unique twist on their origins to not make them overplayed.

2420,6 March 2019,Phlebotinum87,10," **Spoilers** I don't get the hate. I loved it.
","I have just come away from seeing Captain Marvel with my partner, who is a massive CM fan and has read most, if not all, of the Captain Marvel solo stories to date. Between the comic references I caught (and the comic reverences excitedly whispered to me as the movie played) I don't think there was any part of this movie I didn't enjoy.
Samuel L, Annette Bening, Lashana Lynch - 10/10
Ben Mendelsohn's surprisingly likeable Talos was a nice touch, and Jude Law's portrayal of Yon-Rogg left a surprising imprint, either his clever deceit that isn't immediately obvious or his smooth transition to villain. (Or that I found his yellow eyes somewhat sexy which is something I'll take up with my therapist)
It was fun, flashy and engaging. Brie Larson's 'America's sweetheart' personality added a layer of charm to the typically stubborn and headstrong character she portrayed, I geeked out watching her develop her powers and recognising how CM as a movie slipped itself neatly into the MCU timeline.
Was I bothered that the hero was a woman? Hell no.
Do I think CM presents an overpowered player to the MCU? Hell no
It 's exciting to think that now, in 2019, impressionable young girls might come away from this move with a kick ass role model to aspire to be. I'm a 31 year old impressionable man, and *I* have come away from this movie with a kick ass role model to aspire to be.
Also, the Stan Lee cameo was beautiful, from the opening montage, to the brief interaction with CM on the train. Nothing overdone. Just brief, and beautiful.
Truly excited to see how CM presents in Avengers End Game.

2425,6 March 2019,artyduck,1," They just chose the wrong actress for the job
","The movie was awful, for but one reason and one reason only: The actress choice for the leading character. When you make a movie about a comic character and you choose the wrong person to act as that character, you cannot succeed. It feels like someone just insisted on Brie Larson for the job no matter what.
This has nothing to do with the Hero being female, as I noticed some claimed this kind of criticism to be. Just take a look at Gal Gadot and WW, a Character that in my opinion is one of the best Comic super heroes of all time. THAT was how a Captain Marvel should have looked and behaved like.
Even if one could argue that looks are a matter of taste (and I definitely think Larson looks nothing like what CM is supposed to look like), I think her acting was just out of place, mediocre at best, and just plain wooden and boring. I couldn't feel anything for her.
The fact that Marvel chose to establish CM's character as a super-important one in the Marvel Cosmos as one can deduce, inter-alia, from the after-credits scene, just intensifies the mistake of choosing Larson for the job, and iterates the sinking feeling that this film is a huge mistake.

While they only briefly touch on how she got her powers, I think they did a good job of telling her story and how she ties in to what we should expect for Endgame.

Bad reviews were not going to keep me from seeing this one. Ignore them. Enjoy the movie for what it is. It's not an origin story, per se.

I imagine that the reviews that claim that this film is 'boring' stem from the younger part of the audience who have been spoon-fed on adrenaline for the past 10 years or so. For me there was more than enough action!
There may have been a slight miscast in Jude Law layers, but otherwise I feel that totally got my money's worth. I also really like Brie Larsson.

2522,16 July 2021,alexscott-35299,6," Not as terrible as I remember!
","When I first watched this movie I thought it was terrible. As a massive marvel fan I thought this movie would be amazing, introducing the skrulls, giving more back story to nick fury and having some of the best marvel characters in it to play with. I was massively disappointed. Since then I've rewatched it a few times and now I realise that it really isn't a bad movie. I love the Star Wars style this movie has with its cosmic feel and massive space battles. The first hour of this movie really is one of the best starts to a marvel film, it just goes down hill from there. The end battle isn't really exciting as the villains just aren't as powerful as Captain marvel and it's so obvious who is going to win. The movie is mostly beautiful with the amazing cgi and glorious wide shots, some parts look a little silly and abit off every now and then but most of the time it's a very good looking movie. I love that the villains don't end up being the skrulls as every single marvel fan expected! Even though they will 100% become villains in the future, it was a surprise to see them depicted as the good guys in this movie and was a pretty good twist in the movie. Now onto the main problem I have with this movie, Brie Larson! Her performance is just wooden and boring in this, the support cast just carries this movie so much and her performance just stands out as the worst by far. I really don't think she suits this role and I do just wish they had cast someone else, I hope she improves in future movies and really proves me wrong. All in all a pretty good first film for one of the biggest characters in the future of tue marvel films. Not that bad!",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

I took four kids aged 9 to 13 and they thought it was the best film they've seen yet (and they've seen a lot). I'm a fully grown adult with a brain and I actually thought this was a good film. I'm not a marvel fan so maybe if you are, you'll find issues with the film but for me - the lead characters were strong, strong female characters, good diversity, the story once it got going was good, I laughed out loud a couple of times and was surprised a couple of times.

","I am a Marvel fan. I go see all the movies, then buy the blu-rays. I have character statues, posters and have read the comics including Captain Marvel. There is a reason people become fans of certain things, and those things done well over time generate more fans until it becomes a ""Juggernaut"" like the MCU has. I fear that it's not unstoppable however, as the sub-par Captain Marvel has painfully illustrated. The movie is a pastiche of poorly written scenes with a bit of uninspired action sprinkled here and there with barely any plot at all. Carol Danvers has no character development whatsoever, no adversity to overcome besides amnesia and no villain to fight. I know there are people saying they like this movie, but I feel like they either aren't being honest or they like it for personal reasons that are not present in the movie. Objectively speaking, in terms of the technical aspects of storytelling, Captain Marvel just isn't effective. Subjectively, I was bored the entire time and the nostalgia parts made me feel as though JJ Abrams was poking me in the ribs asking me if I 'member the 90's. Yes. Yes I do.
And for the record, people are criticizing this movie because it was bad, not because they ""haaaate the wooomans!"" Dismissing legitimate criticisms using this tactic will not produce better films, which is the only thing most people want. The problem is that they built the movie around the idea of ""strong woman"" and promoted it as an identity film, so when the movie ends up being bad some people rush to defend it because they don't want the IDEA to fail. The movie itself is secondary - just a vehicle to slap their bumper stickers on, which is a real shame because this could have been a great addition to the MCU. I hope they learn something from this, but from what I've heard it appears that Marvel actually plans to escalate the identity politics in the next phase which would be an absolute disaster for them.

Marvel has dropped the ball here. An almost invulnerable character isn't a ""hero"" because they aren't in danger hence there isn't any ""real"" tension, drama or threat.

",A friend and I watched the movie this weekend and both of us left saying the same thing. We were both pretty underwhelmed. Brie Larson was pretty terrible. They should never ever have filmed her running. That is the stereotypical gait of a person who's never done anything athletic in her life with her legs flying out sideways as she ran. It was just sad. Then they tried to make her a female version of Tony stark?? I think one of him is enough. Add in her character is basically invulnerable to anything and that makes for a boring movie. I didn't like any of the old (younger versions) characters either. Fury was basically an idiot in love with a cat. It was so cheesy! Colson wasn't much better. Throw in a dollop of social justice and feminism just to really sour a movie and there ya go. The worst marvel movie yet. I don't know why women have to be portrayed as feminist in order for Hollywood to think they're strong. My single mom who raised me on her own is a strong woman. Larson is a wisecracking no rule following jerk if you ask me. Oh yeah and her friend sure is mother of the year choosing to let her young daughter talk her into fighting aliens in space and way to go captain marvel for encouraging that to happen. The writing was just idiotic. The only saving grace for this movie was the graphics. Other than that the acting/writing sucked.,/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

I like the story and also the acting. Brie Larson makes the character so charming so that I can neglect some flaws like her fighting scene. It's great, but still a little bit unnatural. For me it's acceptable. Anyway I love the chemicals between Fury and Carol, it's so lovely to see an alien acting so naturally when she first comes to the earth. It's pretty intersting and I made a lot of laughes while sitting in the theater.

","I watched it two times just to get the a bit different point of view and both times I failed to find many of the points that the film is criticised for. I do not know about the politics that is going on in Hollywood so my eyesight might be affected by the ignorance, but I enjoyed the film thoroughly. It shows a very well and realistically developed interpersonal relationships between two strangers in a crime that bonds over their shared experiences (everyone who ever went to a place, which was alien in both cultural and lingual aspects knows how easy and fast interpersonal relationships develop between two people who share some similarities and end up finding each other in such a strange environment). I loved the friendship between the two air pilots (Carol and Maria). I fail to see why anyone would complain about the lack of romantic relationship or would start to ""ship"" Maria and Carol as a couple. Reading some of the fan-fantasies or criticism it seems that there are so many people who do not really know that there are many kinds of relationships and very often best friend relationship are more important, takes longer to build and is harder to find that any romantic plot for the sake of having romance. Carol relationship with Fury as well as Monica are the best friendships so far in the Marvel universe together with Hawkeye and Black Widow.
Overall, I loved the dynamic of the characters. I haven't read any of the comics, therefore they all seem consistent with the characterisation from other films (i.e. Fury, Coulson). Some complain about the acting of Brie Larson, but I wonder if they ever complained about the acting of Chris Evans as Captain America, who also does not deliver a lot of acting range and dramatics. Neither of these characters require a lot of emotional acting. However, the scenes that does require it (e.g. after Carol learns her past), Mrs Larson delivers very well. I think her acting was spot on given the character's story and her character overall. Captain Marvel is not a teenage Spiderman. She is an army officer and an ace. Her mindset, how she carries herself are according to that. Plus, she is lost in all possible aspects and on top of that, must save entire species while fighting the only person she knew and trusted. It's an inner conflict and she doesn't go berserk by exposing it to the outside. She internalise it the way any self-controlling, cold-headed person would. I will not say anything about the visual effects, because everyone knows that Marvel really takes the cherry in those.
Overall, this film has a representation of a real interpersonal relationships, therefore, nice character stories and something for the eyes as well. Thank You everyone who worked on it.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

Clearly a lot of these reviews is tearing down Brie's performance. They don't see Brie Larson fit for the role.
However, most of these people have had this opinion even befor watching the movie.
That's not a fair judgment, we actually don't care that you dislike Brie, though I'll give it to you that this was not her best performance. (that's another discussion, we are here for the movie as a whole)
But it's defiantly not worth these poor ratings. Captain Marvel is good, not the best, and yes it's way overhyped. In fact I think most people just wants to watch End Game, and pass on this one.
But I thought this was interesting, the way Marvel has kept the style of humor and added in some humorous conversation, and the plot fits great towards the MCU storyline. Overall I found the movie entertaining and not boring at all. It's going to be interesting to follow her into End Game, and to observer how she as this *new* powerfull female will get along with the remaining Heros. She do have an attitude, and I quite like that.

","Marvel are yet to miss the mark (bar some early issues), and Captain Marvel is no different. An origin story packed with action, an incredible character arc and villains to remember. It steers away from its source material, which provides an elegant change of pace in the film. Brie Larson is incredible, something missed in the trailers.
However, at times it felt as though as much of the story possible was crammed into a small period of time, throwing the pace a little bit.

","This is not a masterpiece, mind you, but it's a pretty entertaining flick. Its biggest flaw has to be Brie Larson, but not just because of her, also because of the rather bland reactions scripted into her role. Consider what she goes through and the moment of her big revelation is not any more dramatic than when she was getting angry for Jude Law kicking her ass. Yet even this is minor. One can easily believe that a woman in a man's world, who went through amnesia and two separate army training regimens would be a little bit stiff and guarded.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

2713,8 March 2019,miguelhutten-17506,1," Absolute borefest.
","Boring, predictable, with sad attempts at comedy, a dull uncharismatic main actress delivering one of the most lackluster performances I have seen in a long time and definitely a total miscast, which is disappointing considering the impeccable casting this franchise has had up until now. Excellent de-aging of Samuel L. Jackson and great special effects, decent soundtrack, It was nice to see Ronan the Accuser and especially Coulson again but ultimately this movie makes Thor the dark world and Iron Man 3 look like masterpieces, taking the place of the worst MCU movie yet. If it's strong relatable and inspiring female heroines you're looking for, Captain Marvel will disappoint you, but do not despair since in the MCU alone you have some top calibre ones like the Valkyrie, The Black Widow, Shuri, Okoye,The Wasp, Scarlet Witch and Maria Hill and elsewhere Hit-Girl (Kick-Ass),Wonder Woman, Harley Quinn, Alita Battle Angel, Ellen Ripley, Jyn Erso, Selene (Underworld), Hanna, Rita Vrataski, Zoe Washburne,The Bride (Kill Bill), Sarah Connor, Princess Leia,Trinity (The Matrix) and Katniss Everdeen to name just a few and hopefully many more to come (not to mention the ones in tv) but the main character of this movie doesn't add to this list but she actually does them a great disservice. Despite of the unimpressive trailers and the despicable marketing for this movie (referring to them using the twitter account of deceased Stan Lee to shamelessly promote this movie) I watched it in order to not miss anything relevant to Avengers: Endgame but it turned out that it wasn't necessary at all, making this the biggest waste of time in my life.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","I went in with high expectations, as I always do. This film didn't disappoint, either. The casting is awesome, the special effects - impressive, the story - cool, the fight sequences - could have been better. But that's the only drawback that I could find. This movie is great; no movies of the MCU could be scored below a 6 other than Iron-Man 2 and 3, and the Thor films. Was this film Black Panther level epic? Nowhere near, but the MCU pulled yet another good movie out of their always impressive bag.
Brie Larson is a decent actor, and her big brown eyes and moody look make her so attractive. I think she's gorgeous.
The best thing about this film is Danvers chemistry with a younger Nick Fury, they bounce off eachother so effortlessly. Ben Mendelson was quality, as always. He played the charming, charismatic skrull leader. Loved it.
I don't get what all of the -4 reviews are about; the MCU haven't made sub-par movies since Iron-Man 2 and 3, and Thor 1 and 2. They have perfected their formula since then. I was amped when I left the cinema, this film just felt good. It's a massive feel-good film. It didn't even feel like a showy feminist empowerment movie, it just had a badass, powerful hero who just so happened to be a cute, moody looking girl. And what's the big issue with that anyway.

","I hate people who try to influence me with their own personal agendas. If I let them do that, it means I let others decide for me. No thanks. I ignored the idiots who either didn't even see the movie or went to see it with their minds made up, and decided to make up my own mind about Captain Marvel. So here's my honest opinion:
It was entertaining, funny and caught me off guard here and there...
Ben Mendelsohn as the Skrull Talos was genius! As refreshing as Sam Jackson was when on screen... And Goose the Cat? Appropriately timed humor... I definitely laughed a number of times throughout the film. Now, Brie Larson?
She did her thing. She played Captain Marvel as she was directed to I'm sure. So with that said, whatever liberties she took as an actress with the character fit who they were trying to make Carol Danvers out to be in the film's story: a strong, powerful woman who rises when expected to stay down and doesn't need to explain herself to no one. Makes her the bad guy kicking badass Captain Marvel is!
...however, I'm excited to see the direction the Russo bros take with her character in Endgame. See, the Russo's I feel do an awesome job at making these powerful superheros feel relatable, by exposing them to their vulnerabilities. And so, when they rise, you as the viewer effortlessly appreciate and cheer for the hero because you saw their struggle, you saw their fall, and you somehow relate to them.
That, is what was missing from this film. So in the end, I learned who Captain Marvel is, I respect her, but I can't relate to her. So it makes the story suffer just enough.
With that off my chest, I can honestly give Captain Marvel 8 stars.

","I started the movie thinking I would only slightly enjoy it but ended up positifly surprised.
the first 10 to 20 minutes can be boring because we need to understand and learn about the characters, but after that it is not a challenge to keep watching.
Overall the movie had a good pacing, some good callbacks, connections and references to other movies in the MCU and the scenes worked well to call for either a certain emotion or the actual lack of. There's a scene in which Captain marvel faces the enemy group alone in a room and she surprisingly barerly shows an emotion during the fight and talking (this is weird for a reason I don't wish to spoil the movie over). But if you ask me, the lack of emotion fits perfect considering the past few minutes she's been through learning so much information",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","Well, although most MCU ""fans"" are throwing stones here, I think for the rest of the world is a worth watching film. First of all, because there is screenplay, it's not like most of DC movies which show a mix of visual effects and very little story itself. Is it the best story? Far from it, but for presenting a new character, I think it's fair. About the overpowerment, this is a MCU issue, since we can see some heroes fight like gods (Thor really is, by the way) and then somehow they completely forget they have power or just enough to solve the challenge. At least in this movie, the girl starts without memory and we discover along with her what she is able to.

The only reason I didn't give it a higher score is because it didn't do anything new and played it safe. I understand that just about any Marvel origin movie will probably be like this and that it's hard to bring something new to a run of movies that now has over 20 titles in its collection.

I'll admit myself this movie has flaws, but that doesn't mean it's not GOOD. First off, it does start slow, but once carol comes to earth the movie is endless fun with its flaws here and there. The chemistry between nick fury and carol is one of the highlights of the movie, we get a look at how fury was before the start of the avengers and tony stark, the action is great, the humor is well balanced, and the soundtrack is one of the BEST since guardians. The real stealers of the show is goose, and Talos, played by Ben Mendelssohn was phenomenal. He was also a Villian in rogue one, which was another great performance, but this was easily his best. This movie also ties in to endgame really well and it's awesome to see this side of the mcu in the 90s. Of course this movie will have it's flaws, but the one star trolls who hate this movie because it's different is ridiculous. They all did the same to black panther. Carol is portrayed exactly like the one from the comics, so it's obvious these trolls probably don't even know who captain marvel is.

","Captain Marvel Review
*Brie Larson's performance alongside Jude Law is stunning. Not only is she in her element but she also gives her powerful lead female character a personality a boost with her natural charm and haughty traits. Adored her backstory and life journey as well. I'm absolutely loving her!
*Marvel always finds a way to entertain it's audience and that's saying that the movie is packed with a bunch of easter eggs, cameos, bomb drops, mentions. Just wait till you see the opening credits honouring Stan Lee! For me, this was a very much necessary extravaganza after the dreadful ending og infinity war to alleviate our misery and provide an insanely powerful female superhero. Marevllites,(as Fury calls us) you simply can't afford to miss this! Just wait till you get to the amazing transcendence scene with golden gleaming aura spreading on the silver screen and that warm fuzzy feeling when the audience erupts with joy. It's the very expressive and powerful MCU film I've seen till date. No doubt Cap. Marvel will play a distinguished role in the upcoming MCU movies.
*Set in the '90's the film nods towards retro lifestyle on Earth as well as highlighting technological advancements of the alien species beyond our galaxies. The 'Kree' and 'Scrull' civilization offers a deeper and a wider look into the MCU's ever expanding realm. New technology, powerful weapons and a few recurring characters who'll give you chills and laughs.
*Don't even get me started the visual effects! Marvel Studios seem to outdo themselves every single time with cutting edge state of art VFX and motion graphics. Undoubtedly, Captain Marvel's golden aura and jet speed visuals are a backbone in the overall movie experience. Every single element in the movie seems so realistic and fluid. Truly marvel surpasses itself with every new movie. Exiting the theatre will feel like coming back from the future.
*Brie Larson's character is emotionally driven, perhaps even more than other superheroines like WW/Black Widow. Her journey from an air force pilot to the legendary space shattering woman is truly remarkable, inspiring and expressive to say the least. The motto 'Higher, Further, Faster' is truly apt to Captain Marvel.
*The humour in the movie is so fresh! I mean Marvel leaves no stone unturned to find and discover new ways to entertain the audience. Sometimes it's the CGI, at times the odd dillemma but mostly it's Nick Fury. Samuel L. Jackson's role just fuels the excitement and thrill of the journey. Nothing is subtle in the movie except the emotional appeal of Carol Denver's which occurs at regular intervals adding a bit of a mature tone to the story.
*Movie has some major and noteworthy secondary characters who contribute very much to the storyline and you can't help but love them in the end. Almost everybody who has a role in the film is memorable and highly appreciated by the audience.
*Love the soundtrack from the movie. It nods towards the '90's pop hits with Nirvana's 'Come As You Are' and 'I only feel happy when it rains' perfectly blending with the scenes.
*A funny, action-packed, family friendly, inspiring and futuristic movie that you should definitely watch with friends/family this weekend. I mean, it's a whole package deal. Sets a good example for kids. (Inside joke, see it and know it). You simply can't afford to miss this.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","Well, to get this honest but unpleasant business over, the objection to the Suffragettes is not that they are Militant Suffragettes. On the contrary, it is that they are not militant enough. A revolution is a military thing; it has all the military virtues; one of which is that it comes to an end. Two parties fight with deadly weapons, but under certain rules of arbitrary honor; the party that wins becomes the government and proceeds to govern. The aim of civil war, like the aim of all war, is peace. Now the Suffragettes cannot raise civil war in this soldierly and decisive sense; first, because they are women; and, secondly, because they are very few women. But they can raise something else; which is altogether another pair of shoes. They do not create revolution; what they do create is anarchy; and the difference between these is not a question of violence, but a question of fruitfulness and finality. Revolution of its nature produces government; anarchy only produces more anarchy. Men may have what opinions they please about the beheading of King Charles or King Louis, but they cannot deny that Bradshaw and Cromwell ruled, that Carnot and Napoleon governed. Someone conquered; something occurred. You can only knock off the King's head once. But you can knock off the King's hat any number of times. Destruction is finite, obstruction is infinite: so long as rebellion takes the form of mere disorder (instead of an attempt to enforce a new order) there is no logical end to it; it can feed on itself and renew itself forever. If Napoleon had not wanted to be a Consul, but only wanted to be a nuisance, he could, possibly, have prevented any government arising successfully out of the Revolution.

2816,8 March 2019,mythbuff,10," Ignore the bad reviews from people who haven't even seen the movie
","This film had a 5.2 for days before it even premiered. That should tell you right away that 90% of the critical reviews on IMDb are complete BS from people who haven't even seen the film yet. I just finished the movie and I can say with absolute honesty: Captain Marvel was excellent.
I was very worried about the movie because the trailers did not do it justice (though the ""Her/Hero"" wordplay was great). The effects looked cheesy, as did the writing. But I was impressed with how much the effects improved from the trailer and the only poor bits of writing were IN the trailer (I know, usually it's the other way around with the only GOOD scenes being shown in the trailer).
I was also worried that the film would be all about ""Boom! Girl power!"" But it wasn't. I am very much a feminist, but films that are entirely ""girl power"" are usually poorly done or go out of their way to show men in a bad light. But not Captain Marvel. No part of the plot was about Carol being a woman. It was entirely about her being a superhero. Gender was hardly even referenced other than one scene where the pilot says ""Women weren't allowed to fly combat missions yet, so we volunteered for this experimental flight to prove our worth."" And that's not even some in-your-face feminist propaganda. That's just straight fact of the 80s/90s.
So, ignore the trolling men who flooded all the review websites with negative reviews before even watching the film and go see it yourself. You will be as pleasantly surprised as I was.

Especially when they go so far as to silence free speech(rotten tomatoes shill). I really have no idea what Marvel was thinking making this movie. All they have built up , all the marvel movies, ruined because Brie Larson wanted to spout feminist hate in a world where fans have been asking for a black widow (better actress by far) movie for years , scarlet witch (also a better actress) was one of the biggest badasses in Infinity Wars, and wonder woman had no problems doing well...yet if you dont like this movie its because you're an ""evil male"". I loved Infinity Wars and was all in , couldnt wait for the story to advance....then it felt like everything up to that point got put on pause, to force-intro me to a mediocre character I never wanted played by an even more mediocre actress. Because Brie Larson chooses to ignore the already powerful females in the MCU. Played by actresses that dont cost their employers millions when they open their mouths.

","NON SPOILER: If you fed dictionary definitions into a computer or gave aliens the definition of what a hero is and asked them to make a movie about a ""hero"" this would get spat out. It's honestly as though the writers have never read a piece of classical literature or a comic book pre - 2003 to understand what a hero is. If we were going to get an infallible protagonist to turn the tide in Avengers: Endgame at least give us one with charisma. The effects and visuals in this movie are also an oddity, ranging from cutting edge to Saturday morning Power Rangers quality. The Carol Danvers character should have been introduced in phase 2 of the MCU anyway and giving us this origin story now is like cramming for an exam. Better still the character Marvel should have used here was The Sentry (an omnipotent but very damaged character) in order to tip the scales in Endgame. The fact it had to be a female is understandable but Disney fluffed their choice with this character when they had dozens of others to choose from, and to say this is miscast is understating. If moving forward with the character, Kevin Feige may want to consider recasting, since Brie Larson's press campaign has been a disaster of historical significance and the actress is far better suited to smaller art-house type fare. It's a matter of objective fact that she has damaged the franchise and will probably continue to do so in the future since contemporary audiences do not forgive and forget often. This film is the MCUs bottoming out moment and it's astounding it has taken this long to happen but it was inevitable. It by no means breaks the franchise but the year long break from the MCU which approaches us after Spiderman Far From Home is probably warranted for both the studio and audiences",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

Now the movie, the movie had a simple but dull plot with her old life and then the twist in the end just felt lacking and the aliens who got rescued really could have used some remodeling or something for more classy. And of course the end was a happy ending with her blasting her way through like 5 ships in a matter of seconds. In my opinion this strength gets really boring and isn't special and feels that it doesn't use skill or thoughts. I also thought Brie Larson didn't put enough emotion in her words and in this story you could have with the twist with her friend and everything but she just acted in and ""okay then"" way. On the good side, the story wasn't too bad, the actions scenes were cool and the Stan Lee cameo was super funny and cool for Stan Lee's remembrance and in the end the rip for Stan Lee was really nice and touching and I appreciate that.

There are many plot holes throughout this movie that truly weigh it down as a whole, let alone in connection to the comics, and with rewatching it. It also forced Fox's X-Men: Dark Phoenix to dumb down the film even more to fit Disney's needs with the 'villian's' The Skrulls. It may not directly be because of this film, but I feel the concept of the skrulls is incredibly lazy. Placing them throughout the MCU to be disguised as another supposed character- it's just cheap, and it frustrated me they decided to pull that throughout. I was also not a fan of how they explained Nick Fury got his eyepatch, just ridiculous to say the least. Besides all that though, the film is somehow very easy to watch. I found myself very entertained throughout- whether it was the visuals, the impressive fight scenes, or its mystery at hand- I was never bored throughout the film- just frustrated.

Brie Larson and SLJ's paring is one for the ages. It's just the right amount of funny without feeling forced. And the lack of a romantic lead, unlike Wonder Woman, means Carol Danvers stands on her own, and does so with style and grace.
For Mavel fans, this film brings the MCU full circle, tying up a few loose ends (how did Fury lose his eye key amongst them). The post-credits does well to ensure that Endgame is set up nicely, making it clear we are near the end.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

One was black panther which many of this people claimed to be anti-white the other is captain marvel which the same faction claiming to be anti male or better anti white male. You can read all those hate on social media or watch those kind of videos on youtube which feel like propagande flicks from the third reich. Its breath taking and all those incited followers of this channels who cry ""burn the witch"".

Surprise: nothing is what it seems. This film has everything I dislike in a comic-book adaptation. The script is nothing but a series of quips strung together with the occasional maudlin attempt at character development, the acting is as 2D as the original magazine pages, the plot muddled and contrived, the direction simple and predictable, and the special effects are uninspired and unoriginal (with the exception of de-aging Samuel L. Jackson, which was impressive). As a super-hero, Captain Marvel's abilities seem to be whatever the plot (such as it is) calls for and, while fans can try to justify the film's ridiculous illogic (like where her costume goes when in she's in 'civvies'), the whole character didn't make much sense. While the film was full of silly images, the absolute worst was in the climactic battle, when her newly colourised costume sprouts some kind of space helmet with a slot allowing her hair to stick out like a blond Roman helmet crest.

","Admittedly, it is one of the more forgettable MCU pictures, but it still offers the high quality entertainment value of even the more middle-tier flicks in the franchise, never failing to keep you invested in the story and caring for the characters. The best character work here is the relationship between Carol Danvers and Nick Fury, who's interactions provide some of the film's best moments. Speaking about Nick Fury, the de-aging CGI technology used here on Samuel. L Jackson is phenomenal, to the point where it becomes completely unnoticeable. Marvel have always had success with this in the past, but this is clearly the best example of this technology seen in any film to date. Some of the other CGI, especially in the climactic action sequence, isn't nearly as good, but thankfully it doesn't prove to be too much of an issue as you are invested with the characters while watching. The 'live-action' action sequences aren't as involving as they could have been, mainly due to the poor editing, however they're still entertaining enough in the moment. Although it is an origin story, the overall structure and narrative in general allow it to feel somewhat distinct from stories of that type, which is definitely a positive thing and retracts from the predictability of it all. Overall 'Captain Marvel' is a lot of fun and less predictable than expected, but its sometimes badly edited action and the fact that it is fairly unmemorable mean that it never quite reaches the heights of the best MCU movies. 7/10",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","I'll make it very simple and clear: Captain Marvel is really worth a watch. It's just entertaining and visually impressive, exactly what it was meant to be. Just keep this in mind that it's an origin story so don't go looking for an overstuffed complex story. It's just a fun action movie that introduces us to a new superhero Captain Marvel, played brilliantly by Brie Larson. I became an instant fan watching her in this action heroine avatar, something she manages to pull off with ease. Watch her in the action sequences and there's no way you can't be impressed. Viewers were literally cheering for some of the most heroic moments in the film. Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury is as awesome as always, it's just that his character feels even better and refined than what we've seen. Jude Law is also quite good, and so are Ben Mendelsohn and Lashana Lynch. But the one character that ultimately steals the show is Goose, the cat. Some of the sequences involving her are so hilarious that it was really difficult to stop laughing. Visual effects are excellent, and the IMAX 3D viewing just elevated them. And since it's most importantly an action movie, every single action sequence it delivers is impressive, especially the train sequence. I would call it one of the major highlights of the movie. Cinematography in certain portions is really impressive. Humor, like any other MCU movie, is top notch and really manages to make you laugh. Captain Marvel has a simple-looking origin story presented and executed in a terrific manner. The directors have done a great job with the characterization of Captain Marvel, and that is what makes everything in the film seem so good. The pace is brisk, gore is minimal to no, and there's nothing unsuitable for kids. I'd definitely recommend watching Captain Marvel to anyone who likes superheroes or is simply a fan of action movies. You'll love it if you want to be entertained. It also does answer some much-asked questions, and that should be the reason enough for you to stay instead of just walking away.

3025,1 April 2019,rory_woodard,1," We deserve a better movie
","Just like Harry Potter and the Lord of the Rings, the Marvel Cinematic Universe was a major part of my childhood. I've been a cultish follower of the MCU ever since my dad introduced it to me. The experience of watching Tony Stark tinker his way out of a cave and end up divulging, ""I am Iron Man"" to an entire audience of reporters jumpstarted a major aspect of my life. As a girl growing up watching these movies, I was looking forward to the long-awaited female lead, and I had such high hopes for this movie. The reality of it fell flat, and I fear my honest reviews fall on deaf ears as most people hear it as a complaint on the feminist aspects of the movie and a direct reflection of Brie Larson. We deserve a better movie.
While Brie Larson has no acting abilities whatsoever (I firmly believe her success in Room was solely due to the fact that her face and voice are regularly void of all emotion so the role was not much of a stretch) she was not the only issue. The directing and the storytelling were terrible and I can't believe Kevin Feige let Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck massacre this story and the characters within it. What happened to Fury, the stoic, steadfast leader of SHIELD? Why did they make him out to be so disingenuous and happy-go-lucky? This is Nick Fury, the war-hardened soldier we all know and love, experiencing his first glimpse of alien life on Earth, and they turned him into a barely affable fool who failed to bring any realistic comic relief in a movie marinated in attempts at comic relief. His scenes with the cat were ridiculous, and some of the choices he made seemed far-fetched and unrealistic. Why did he bring a woman he barely knew into a secure, top secret, facility? He had no reason to trust her. She had done nothing for him. They had no relationship. And I thought the main goal of the movie would be to develop that relationship and rapport between him and Captain Marvel. What was their story? How did they meet? Why did he have her pager? Why did he wait so long to use it? While a few of these questions were answered, the relationship was forced and the rapport was stale and never developed. The Guardians of the Galaxy developed a quick, one-movie relationship because they went through hell and back together within a short period of time. They were arrested and imprisoned together, they escaped together, they get blown up on Knowhere together, attacked by Ronin and Ravagers together, and end up banding together to hold an infinity stone. Of course they have an amazing relationship after one movie. This movie did not provide an opportunity for Captain Marvel and Nick Fury to develop the relationship that was so desperately needed. Instead, it played pretend and failed, because the audience isn't stupid.
This movie came across as a slapstick parody of the MCU. After rewatching all the movies in preparation for Endgame, I realized it made a mockery of the success Marvel had spent ten years developing. It was as if the directors attempted to poorly imitate Taika Waititi's success in Thor: Ragnorak. And despite the fact that Brie Larson spent her entire press tour bashing men, she spent the entire movie trying to copy the successful acts of Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Pratt. There's a reason Tony Stark and Peter Quill are likeable; they're played by likeable actors who can pull of the hilarious one-liners and quips. Brie Larson doesn't have the likeability or the acting capability to pull that off. She was a poor choice for the movie. The entire character of Captain Marvel was a toss up between a stoic, unflappable Kree soldier and a jovial knockoff of well-loved MCU characters. You never knew which one you were going to get. Would she be joking and laughing in this scene? Or would she be serious and dispassionate? That kind of jostling made the movie into a failed juggling act; the tone was all over the place, making it hard to follow the plot. Who's bad? Who's good? And why are they laughing all of a sudden?
Captain Marvel, the character, was presented with no flaws while the movie was riddled with them. Ronin the Accuser, the Kree leader who'd spent years enacting mass genocide, threatened to unseat Thanos, and held an infinity stone in his hand, turned away when he saw Captain Marvel? I can suspend my disbelief, but not that much, and not like that. The movie had no true villain, no true plot, and was used as a vessel to force the audience into liking Brie Larson and her Captain Marvel presentation and it failed spectacularly. This movie was supposed to pay homage to Stan Lee, not Brie Larson's painful acting career. The reason characters like Thor, Tony Stark, and Captain America are so well loved is because they have flaws. They draw empathetic responses from the audience because the audience can relate to their struggles. There was nothing relatable about Brie Larson's Captain Marvel. She made a historic comic book character into a snobbish b*tch with magic hands. The audience cheered when they saw Thor and Captain America in Infinity War. Captain Marvel will never illicit such a response; if anything, she'll be booed.
It was a testament to how poor the acting, directing, and editing was that I consider this movie to be one of the worst movies I have ever paid money to see. It's an embarrassment to the Marvel Universe, and I will be severely disappointed if Brie Larson and her inhuman, emotionless vacuum of a character swoops in and saves the day in Endgame. I've invested too much time and money into this franchise to watch her single-handedly destroy it. I hope they kill her off.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","The tale was entertaining enough, but the attempt to equalize women with men on masculine terms was extremely heavy-handed. Take every stereotype of male heroes from yesteryear, a la John Wayne or Steve McQueen, and cram them into a single woman- this is Captain Marvel. Larson's character was easily more aggressive and arrogant than any male character in the MCU. Tony Stark could never stand a chance fitting into the room with Carol Danvers, who would throw the first punch. And when I say this, I mean that her lines don't chime of humor or satire; she really believes what she's saying. Every song on the soundtrack(except one that couldn't be left out without a riot) was by female artists from an era that had SO MANY talents. The agro-feminist underscore of the ENTIRE films rings of insecurity more so than a celebration of gender equality.

Another factor I was also very dissapointed in was that they almost only put this film out because of political reasons and because DC already put out a movie with a strong female character. So they had the feeling they had to do it as well so they didn't get all kind of bad attention in the news. When you add all these factors up you simply just can't have a good movie with a beloved character Marvel really ruined their mcu with captain marvel, so it's no wonder she's the least favourite character of almost every Marvel fan and professional movie reviewers.

","I went to watch this as someone who has watched all the mcu movies and have heard about the comic book version of the character, so i wasn't going in blind, but nor was i going in expecting it to be the best movie yet. If you are someone who has never seen any of the mcu movies (if u live under a rock) this is actually a great place to start (well yea chronologically), but also because its only gets better. Now onto the actual movie it self, while watching it i really like the characters sarcastic side, reminds me of a family friendly deadpool. The chemistry between marvel and fury was also great i enjoyed the laughs and conversations between the two. The story line and character development was pretty good. The way the movie linked back to the rest of the mcu was good as well and overall was a good experience. The characters powers are OP in every sense of the word. I understand many people dont like this and are hating the movie for it, but how i see it is this movie never tested her upper limits and she has a long way to go still (which is in itself is mind blowing) and i think endgame will test her powers truly and give us a proper showing of her powers.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

This film is a Mrvel film and has everything you would expect and kinda shows you how the future of the Marvel Franchise is going to go bring in the outset space CGI and so forth. After seeing Captain Marvel I can honestly say I was surprised. It had humor, action and was very well shot. Bringing a bit of oldschool fellings from the sound track and seeing some of the things from the 90's it was great to see. The acting and action in this film were great. We have seen better from other marvel films but it was entertaining never the less. I personally think that they should have done this film before infinty war and not put it in between two major climaxes in the Marvel Film era. Perhaps this would have been better left for after End Game or before Infinty War. We do see a side of Nick Fury that we haven't seen and honestly as awesome as it was. I feel it makes his present day Fury kind of odd. Why did he lose his humor what happened to him. Where has that cat been all these films?..... at this point in time I personally fill that I leaves to many questions and it's not a good thing before we see End Game.

People accusing the filmmakers of inserting 'feminist political agenda' in it, clearly haven't watched or weren't paying attention for the most part of this movie. It was still very much set in a time where sexism was a thing, and women were not seen as adept enough to handle the same jobs as men. Furthermore, there seems to be a lot of talk surrounding her abilities and how she can so easily use them all at once? Were we watching the same thing? For the most part of the movie she is unable to control or use her abilities efficiently because she is told she can't let her emotions effect her combat skills, thus restraining her from reaching her full potential until the end of the film when she realises the truth, and let's not forget how broken Scarlet Witch's powers were in infinity war but no one seemed to have a problem with that?

Carol Danvers is a decisive woman who is on a path of self-discovery with young Nick Fury. Sadly, there is very little information about her past. It's like they shrunk her past in a few memory flashes. I want the future MCU to add more layers to her character arc because it would be terrible to see the strongest avenger as a stoic full-time resilient female lead. The 90s setting, soundtracks and visual effects are impressive.

","To me, the primary issue with this movie is really how much it just makes anything having to do with Nicholas Fury, Colson and SHIELD worse.... These storylines were terrible and needed to never have happened. SLJ was fine in it, he was silly and goofy which is totally in line with the Nick Fury character (wait, not it isn't). And the animation was... distrcating (they made Colson and Fury look 30 years younger which was aweful). Shield's place and involvement made little to no sense other than they wanted to get a way to have CM tied to the rest of MCU and give her an in to Endgame which really creates problems in the first 3 Avengers movies.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

Captain Marvel is not a blip.

The acting was barely passable, the special effects makeup for the Skrulls was laughable for such a high budget movie, and the constant reminder that it was taking place during the 1990s with all the popular music from back then. The music angle worked in Guardians of the Galaxy; it was Quill's shtick. This was just shameless copying.

In the second half, however, it seems like the directors actually talked with her because she seemed more enthusiastic and jokes were coming more and more. The ending seemed rushed with Ronan and the ending in general seemed like they just wanted to finish.
I still give it a 1 just because I don't understand how that movie can have 7.2 and then you have the iron man films with the same or below rating. I would accept a 6.5 or MAX 6.8 but not more.

It reduces their acting ability and makes them look riddiculous. Either way it's a terrible example for girls & women. The CGI of Fury and Coulson's faces are stupid as well.

Really stupid. The movie is worth a viewing on Vudu, but not at the movie theater. Also, it bothers me that Marvel is making her the one to save the universe from Thanos, when we know almost nothing about her and has not gained our respect as a character. I consider it an insult to every other character in the MCU universe. She is basically a nobody that is being elevated to top status without having earned it.

3222,21 March 2019,braidenpalmer,4," Not my favorite and in long/short here is why...
","Caution Some Spoilers:
First of all there is much controversy over this movie and setting that aside I want to clarify a few things. I probably would've rated this lower for various reasons but I want to try and be as fair as I can despite the movies drawbacks. Captain Marvel (CM) is a movie with a political agenda promoting the SJW (social justice warrior). I'm not a fan of Hollywood, Disney, or any other Film maker using entertainment as a source of either subliminally or guilting the viewer to grasping hold of a agenda while losing hold of the entertainment value. I won't elaborate much here you can view the movie and decide yourself. This has ultimately turned me off and came as an unexpected outcome upon visiting AMC to view the movie in the IMAX theater. Over 200 seats and only 10 of us in the theater made for an underwhelming outcome. The movie starts off dedicating itself to Stan Lee who in turn hadn't any real involvement beyond cameos in the MCU franchise. Brie Larson was very bland and much like a runway gal with little attitude and charisma. The movie as an origin story seemed to pick too much in too little time. What could've been great was cut short of its greatness. The fact is the origin felt rushed through the scenes and gravitated to what felt like instantaneous superhero abilities. For example as she falls from the sky she suddenly learns to fly instantly without difficulty. Remember Superman? It took him days to figure it out crashing in The corn fields. They portray her as this lady who is genius in gaining all these abilities instantly without learning and expertly without practice and this is hard to swallow. She didn't learn? She wasn't taught? There are other issues where the Skrulls are friendly when they're a known enemy in the comics. So friendly they are almost pussycats and seem to be pathetic in a number of ways. The kree come off as the major villains here with Jude Law leading them and they bring in a cat from who knows where that is a flirken or alien monster that looks like a cat named Goose. This cat scratches our nick Fury's eye. The cat also eats 5 white men at once protecting CM and on command of Fury. The cat was the first time I laughed and really felt entertained. During the rest of the movie I was laid back, had no issues getting up to use the restroom as I didn't fear missing any parts it just felt fast action and bland. The should've stretched it out to 2.5 hours, added a few more scenes, and maybe considered an actress who had the superhero feel we aspire too. When I watch these marvel movies it's because I want that feeling like someone is out there saving the world/universe, doing good, etc... this was a CM journey of her own. It wasn't to save the world, it wasn't to save anyone for that matter she was merely looking out for herself and if you happened along and she was there you probably got saved by default. It was really an odd portrayal of a superhero I never anticipated being confronted with. I think the bottom line the movie was about this female SJW who had an underlying political agenda (plug) immigration, etc.., to fulfill a present political view by Hollywood/Disney against Trump (our government) and used what could've been a great movie for a political message to the viewers killing the entertainment value it otherwise would've had. Sadly they messed it up and if Disney plans to continue this route I will plan to discontinue seating myself in front of their films. Go watch it and see for yourself and truly sit back and take a fresh look at it and don't get sucked into the action. Pay attention to what's happening.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

This movie is full of so many micro and macro moments that every woman I know (and myself included) can identify with. When she stole the guy's motorcycle after he told her to smile and then called her a freak because she refused, hilarious. I don't think there's a woman alive who hasn't wanted to do what Carol does to Yon-Ragg at the end to some man in her life at least once (I know I have). This movie is made for the female experience, so I'm sorry if it doesn't speak to you. Actually, I'm not, because it wasn't really meant to. Men have 20+ MCU movies made for them, that they can relate to. Captain Marvel is just one made for women in a way they can relate, from the FEMALE lens. And I don't care what anyone says, Monica telling her mother she should consider what kind of example she's setting for her daughter is plenty realistic.

The casual movie goer won't be offended here, mostly because they don't exist here. The real MCU comic fans, especially the female fans, know better. To stamp a 10/10 rating on any movie and still mention it's flaws.....

3250,8 March 2019,mattjliccardi,7," Forget all this hate!
","I went into Captain Marvel with skepticism, because of what people were saying online, and I'm glad to say they were wrong. This movie is great. First off, Brie Larson is perfect in this role. Carol Danvers is a former air force pilot with incredible abilities, she's supposed to be a little snarky or arrogant, while not getting overdramatic in difficult situations. Larson emanates this with her ""lack of facial expression"" aka keeping her cool while being a badass. Trust me, she displays plenty of emotion in this film.
Now, does the movie have corny moments, or does it sometimes feel a little forced? Sure, but we're talking about possibly the most powerful being in the MCU. It was going to be hard to introduce her no matter what the filmmakers did. Not to mention it's the movie leading into one of the biggest, most anticipated blockbusters of all time. But personally, I think they did a hell of a job. Captain Marvel is a great recapture of where the MCU has been while providing insight as to where its going. A cookie cutter marvel movie? No, this is this era's Iron Man. We have a character fighting a war she was told to fight, only to realize later that she can use her talents for a better cause. I don't think the parallels between this installment and past films are the filmmakers saying ""hey let's just do what we did before because screw it."" They are deliberate parallels to show that we can have similar heroes, similar stories, on a much larger scale. People are upset because they think Captain Marvel is too powerful when Feige explicitly said this is what would happen. For anyone who has been following the MCU for the past 11 years, do you really think they would have a character come along and just defeat Thanos easily? The fact of the matter is, the MCU is getting bigger, its villains getting stronger. The heroes have to change with it. Something will happen in Endgame to even the odds. For now, this is a great origin story with very emotional scenes, kickass action, genuinely funny moments, and a well written (albeit clunky at times) story that encapsulates what I've loved about Marvel films in the past while showing us that things are about to go much higher, further, and faster. Captain Marvel will lead the Studio's foray into the cosmic realm of Marvel, and I am 100% behind her.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","After movie ended, all i remembered is i stare to the ceiling and watching the light spots. The movie is an okay movie if you don't read marvel comics and don't watch the avenger series. Ms marvel and fury were so out of characters in this one. De age fury is good at funny scene but his action movements were too slow. Didn't make you feel like he is a young/middle age agent. (Jackie Chan in foreigner is much quicker and realistic th fury in marvel) The happy go lucky agent and origin of how he became one eyed is just meh. The main actress is good at sad scene but for other scene, she usually bad. Looks like she is bore tbh.(the opening scene dialogues esp) The plot is uninteresting and you can see the twists miles away. And the plot holes... The action scenes in the movie are basic. I even suspect the movie is made by asylum production if not for the expensive cgs. The cgs, they are great, the landscapes are real treat to eyes. These cgs and the cat is the only saving grace of the movie. They threw alot of things in the movie as nostalgia of 90s but the songs are not so 90s. There is one scene when peoples are waiting impatiently at disc loading. In actual 90s, people are used to loading, coz that is already fastest available thing in 90s. I don't know why aliens are hiding in game room/recreational room too. Or the terrasect in some junk box. There is this girl born from single mother that want her mom to go to war rather then being with her too. Usually you would want your mom to be with you than encourage her to go om dangerous missions, isn't it? I suspect this movie can make your IQ goes down. 1The plotholes, 2 the bad flashbacks, 3the dialogues, 4the predictable twists,5 bad action sequences, predictable near deaths of some characters (something like don't stare at your family so lovingly when there is a shoot-outs), 6wrong 90s theme, 7hero suit design (i remembered atleast three suit that goes better with ms marvel), 8pure lucky way of getting super power(way too lucky, no ups and downs, no responsibility), 9no good villain just your typical grunts(the accuser was a lie), 10 de-aged fury with aging actions, 11 fury's one eyed revelation, 12 captain marvel personality in movie are serious turn-offs imo. 1 cgs are good, still marvel class ( esp planet scenery and deage fury).2 the scenes are beautiful(esp her friend house and surrounding ).3. If you think of this movie as low budget buddy cop movie, everything is bearable. ( Just don't be too focus like me.

","I loved this movie so much! I've been a fan of captain marvel for a long time, and I've been waiting for this movie for a long time as well! Brie Larson and Samuel L Jackson have a wonderful chemistry onscreen with their dialogue and interactions. Brie played Carol in an awesome way, the character was not bland in my opinion. She was confident and had humor to her lines and aspects. The score was awesome, definitely different than other marvel films. The effects were so AMAZING! The de-aging for Fury and Coulson was so realistic, I forgot it was even happening. The only things I didn't like were the whole eye-truth for Fury (it kind of decreases the importance throughout the rest of the films now that we look back on the fact that it was just an infected scratch. Cmon) and the fact we only saw Ronan for a few minutes, I wish he was a slightly bigger character and that we saw more foreshadowing and events that strengthened his character for Guardians.

","Although being a huge fan of the MCU, I only saw this one for the sole reason that it leads into Endgame. That's it. If this had been released earlier, I think I would have skipped it. I don't like Brie Larson. That's not being sexist, I just think her acting skills resemble a plank of wood. Having said that, she done an ok job here. The problem I have with this character is she is too powerful, overly powerful even. As in, she was never in any danger at any point of this movie. The MCU as we know it comes to an end with Avengers Endgame. A culmination of 10 years of investing into characters and story only for an overly powerful female character to sweep in a month before and save the day doesn't sit well with me. And it's not just because she's female before anyone gives me crap, it's just very forced for her to enter the fight this late in the game being as powerful as she is. As it stands now, from what we've seen, Captain Marvel will wipe the floor with Thanos without breaking a sweat! That's not right. EndGame should be the original Avengers reassembling to defeat thanos and undo the snap. I'm all for Captain Marvel coming into the fold but I fear she'll be the main focus of endgame when it really should be about Cap and Tony reuniting and possibly sacrificing themselves. This movie was ok, it was nothing special. The ""I'm just a girl"" song choice when she learned to control her powers and start kicking ass was an eye rolling moment to say the least, but I can't give the movie too many negatives...nor compliments. It was alright, but it will get more praise than it deserves because it was a female lead superhero movie. That's just the world we live in now where diversity takes precedence over deservance. Black Panther was the same. Great movie don't get me wrong, but definitely not deserving of the amount of praise it recieved.

Amidst an intergalactic feud between the Kree (noble warrior heroes, as described by Vers) and the Skrulls (green-skinned shape-shifting aliens), Vers is sent hurtling towards Earth after barely escaping with her life following a botched stealth mission. Stranded on Earth, she meets Nick Fury (Jackson), who is at first reluctant to believe her intergalactic stories. When the Skrulls arrive on Earth shortly after, morphing into humans to disguise themselves, Fury and Vers team up to stop the imminent alien threat.

","I'm really puzzled by all the bad reviews but to each their own. First off before I saw the movie, I saw the basic preview but nothing else. I don't know anything about Brie Larsen's feminist statements nor do I even care. It actually didn't even occur to me that there was a ""feminist message"". I'm a guy, I always have been but I recognize that in many ways women have to struggle against the odds. So to me her character was just a strong character overcoming the odds and finding herself. I saw this movie as somewhat of a coming of age story since she is discovering who she is. I'm not sure what people are talking about with the lack of acting. Yeah there's a few cheesy moments but these movies are based on comic books. Some people take them too seriously. The banter especially between Larsen and Jackson was really enjoyable. And a super yay for including a young Coulsen. I love that guy. The movie explores the complexities of war which was interesting. And the action was fresh and engaging. I was never bored actually. Perhaps some people didn't realize the movie took place during the 90's? And the origin story with Nick Fury's eye patch haha so good. Again, it's based on COMIC books people. Some people may have the misconception that comic books are all about super heroes with powers who save people and fight super villains. But they can also be thought provoking science fiction as well that stretches the imagination. Many of the main writers like Peter David for example also write sci-fi novels independently. Anyways I'm glad this movie currently has a 7.1 rating. I hope it stays that way.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","Maybe it was the fact that this movie came out as the last MCU movie before Endgame, but I just couldn't get myself to stay engaged in it. Practically everything about this movie is forgettable and boring. The plot is very basic, although I do actually like the expectation subversion regarding the two opposing races. Unfortunately, the movie tries to combine several different focus-points, which ends up damaging all of them. There's simply not much of interest to be found in the majority of the movie. The main character is dull and uninteresting, and there is practically no stakes related to her powers. The side characters are equally bland, and while Nick Fury is always a joy to watch, he's not important enough to save the movie. The villain is so forgettable and annoying, I couldn't believe it, and the movie's attempt at creating a strong connection between the villain and the hero ultimately fails, seeing as none of the characters are well written enough. The movie does have some great CGI, particuarly with some of the character designs, but that's what you expect from Marvel, so it didn't push any boundries. The comedy is surface level and just alright, and the same could be said for the emotional moments. This is probably one of the least entertaining movies Marvel has ever made, it's not interesting in the slightest, and I doubt I will revisit it ever again.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

Avengers Endgame may be one of Marvel's biggest events and I hope it will not be ruined from Captain Marvel.

In the plot,I thought at first the story was a bit lost, it did not amuse so much. However, after about 30 minutes, it began to get more interesting, made more sense to the film, bringing finally the long-awaited battles she held, so, as I said, it was worth the wait.

3356,6 March 2021,chrisprogler,7," Not Marvel's best, but better than many give it credit for being
","Captain Marvel is a very divisive movie, more than most in the MCU. There are things to praise: the action scenes are great, the story is a fun and engaging adventure, and it's Marvel's first female-led movie since the MCU began way back in 2008, which is absolutely an important thing. The character herself is flat and not extremely relatable, though I suspect on some level that this is intentional. People criticize her for her weakness supposedly being her ""emotions"" while she's so flat and stoic, but I think they're missing the point: that never was her true weakness at all. The Kree were manipulating her into thinking she had to work to restrain her powers; she was never the emotional loose cannon that they tried to gaslight her into believing that she was. Though this brings us to a key problem with the movie: the character genuinely has no real weakness, severely harming her relatability. This is a common problem with these overpowered-type characters. In my view, Carol Danvers is not someone you can relate to in the same way hat you can empathize with Tony Stark or Steve Rogers. Carol herself is definitely awkward and stilted, though again, I think this is intentional, and honestly I find it a bit refreshing to have a Marvel protagonist who isn't so effortlessly charismatic and wisecracking. She feels like the awkward kid in the class who happens to also have unstoppable cosmic power; it's an interesting dynamic, though not the best one for storytelling purposes. This whole thing definitely drags the movie down, and while I do like this movie, I fully admit that it could and should have been better. I'm interested to see what they do with the character going forward.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

So, if we make a female more powerful than any other characters, people will love it, no?"" Uh... no. What people love are well written characters. Here we have a character designed to ""fight the patriarchy"". It's absolutely ridiculous.
How long is Hollywood going to push on all of us their moralistic view? We are not kids? We can think on our own. These movies have a mainly male public. Why is it that men can't get what they like to see in a movie? Imagine romantic comedies chastizing women for future divorce settlements, or romantic comedies packed with violence and male stuff: do you think women would watch? You just wonder if they aren't trying to dissuade men from watching movies! Is this a conspiracy by sports grey eminences to divert men from movies to sports?
I will admit the movie is at times spectacular. But the character is so empty, the film is so politically charged that it's simply spoiled. It's crap. Avoid if you can.

I'm not ashamed to say that I had to pinch myself during one amazing fight scene that I was finally seeing a female superhero who just got on with the job, and some happy tears were shed.

The bad thing is that it has a very simple and generic story that could have been made the most of due to some interesting points that it had. Samuel L. Jackson is a good actor who still introduces us to Nick Fury before being the Nick Fury seen in the other movies. Here he is funny comic relief and that may disappoint those who already know him. Brie Larson fits the character of Carol Danvers as far as she looks at it, but her character is too generic and flat. Carol doesn't have much of a personality and that makes her a difficult character to empathize with.

In truth this is an average Marvel movie, something like one of the Antman movies in terms of scale and impact. Its a simple origins story so its not fair to compare it something of the size of a Guardians or Avengers.
The effects and cinematography are fine, however the acting, script, humour and action sequences are very average, it is not an emotional roller coaster by any means. This movie does not trigger any strong emotional responses, but this is a superhero movie anyway.
There are on the surface some politics woven into the story, its about refugees. Also this is some female empowerment stuff however that is obviously not aimed at people like me. I just chose to ignore it and it didnt really spoil anything for me. In truth this is more of a Marvel movie aimed at a young female audience. Its simply not for men. Similar to how Black Panther was aimed at a black audience, this will be well received by its target demographic.

Jackson was the only redeeming aspect of the film for me, although his character was nothing spectacular compared to his roles in other films.
Overall, this film felt completely unnecessary. I was expecting at least some level of cinematic quality due to the insane amount of promotion this film received. Instead. we now have Captain Marvel shoe-horned into the MCU timeline, which has left me worried about the next Avengers film.

Shield is also depicted as the first Man In Black movie and the jokes with the cat are also textbook MiB with Will Smith swapped by Sam L Jackson.

I was proud that my daughter could grow up, watch that movie and feel that she too could be a super hero. After watching this film, not only did it miss that mark, but it was all over the place. When my daughter is older I can only apologize that the leader in superhero entertainment missed the mark on a strong female character that is relatable in life. gamora, nebula and especially black widow have more defined positive roles in the marvel movies than Carol Danvers. This film should have been a revelation that women are stronger than men. It doesn't even touch on that position until the last 15 minutes.

Well, when you see a powerful woman, you hate her, as if she would put you down and laugh at you. Some people become so nervous when they see a girl beyond powerful. I do believe all those hate message is not about any actors or actress in this movie, it is about a woman having a career that is envied by other men.
This movie is about equality. All the plot in it shows that women don't need to be silly or to be irrationally brave. They just like other normal men, they fight for themselves and fight for honor. A powerful woman are not always a beautiful woman who need to seduce their enemies, and they just fight like others.

","That is to say unlike a richer drama or biopic etc, my enjoyment of Marvel blockbusters never depends on what state of mind I'm in or who I'm with; They're perfectly the same to me no matter what. Some other movies that I truly and completely love, I re-watch sometimes and think they're utter embarrassing rubbish, then next time, I love it again. That is the exciting part of truly great movies, they can't resonate within you all the time, and some grow and flex with you, both apart and together like some friends and family. But Marvel movies, on the whole, as they've refined the formula over and over again, are the fast food of movies; I'm never disappointed and never overly satiated; I know what to expect and there's a nice warm familiarity with that, but I'm never challenged.

","This movie was just a mess...it wasn't terrible, but it just isn't what I expect from Marvel, especially following the last couple of years of movies, which were just great. Basically, I'm trying to say that this movie does not hold up compared to previous movies of phase three. Brie Larson is surprisingly bland in this movie, it isn't as funny as it sets out to be, and the characters aren't very good. And on top of this movie not being that great, Brie Larson also got some bad press, which definitely didn't help, as it lead to people review bombing and doing some other things, which did not help the movie's reputation.

3593,10 March 2019,lizchav,2," Captain meaningless
","Let me begin. The disappointment of this movie begins with Jude Law manipulating her to control her emotions in order to prevent her from seeking the truth about her visions. I believe it was several times where the point was made to suppress her emotions. Apart from one tear and one watery eyed moment, (I'll get to the part where she breaks out of her restraints at the end) I saw ZERO emotion come from this grown woman.
Next, in the process of escaping the skrulls' ship she creates an immense hole that started a vacuum effect. She miraculously pulls herself back into the ship and walks effortlessly out the area and around the corner even though ever other being and object in that room went flying out. Ok, ok, so you'll argue, she IS Captain Marvel, and to that I say, remember her escape pod also got damaged? No, Captain Marvel protection power there, the girl was holding on for dear life.
By the way, the movie is saturated with scenes of her as a young girl being taunted and yelled at by every male throughout her life. Seriously, she has no other memorable moment in life, other than the less than genuine friendship she has with her fellow pilot and her mentor. Can I just add that Mar-Vel was originally a man who she fell in love with and tried to rescue her after she was kidnapped. A good male relationship in her life??? Nah, let's just make everyone she loves female down to her 'friend's' child. (Dear Disney, some of us love our husbands, dads, and brothers). Oh and by the way, would you leave your family and adopt another one just because your dad yelled at you for doing something stupid like crashing a go-cart that would have resulted in a major permanent injury?!?!? I'm of Spanish descent, yelling would be the least of my worries. Ha!
Let me go back to the friend she had. I have a better relationship with the cashiers at my grocery store. It looked like an amateur and less than talented drama club played those scenes out. ""Act like the two of you are friends."" ACTION! :-/.
One thing the friend revealed was ONE big CHARACTER FLAW of Captain Marvel. Her friend revealed that she cheated on a race, to that she responded, 'What's wrong with taking a shortcut?' Her friend responded by saying the shortcut was against the rules, and our hero just smirks. That makes sense, in the beginning when Jude Law was doing hand to hand combat with her and she started feeling like she was losing, she immediately cheated by using her powers. Anything to get ahead huh, forget the rules as long as you come out on top? I wouldn't teach my dog to be like you. (by the way in reality she was a NASA genius and worked for the CIA...not this garbage)
The movie is just repetitious to say the least, but now that I mentioned pets, I believe the cat was sent to save the movie, it took up several humorous scenes that I'm sure would have been otherwise taken up by another flashback of a crying little girl. The relationship between Samuel L Jackson and the cat saved the two hours of torture from Larson's dry and unimpressionable personality.
The ending topped this off with a putrid stench that I pray to soon forget. Why?! All I could ask myself is 'why would a hero destroy missiles and further more, destroy one ship of the beings who caused so much death and destruction to just let them go in the end?' She went through that ship like a knife through butter and Lee Pace looks at her, makes a declaration to capture her, and then leaves with no objection from her! She floats there so they could bask in all her glory then let's them get away?? To what end? You think they will have turned over a new leaf? Of course no! She tells Jude Law to send them a message that shes coming after them....uh wow, they were right in front of you why did you need a messenger?? Jude was on a wrecked ship, and yet she rushed back to finish him off and let the greater evil escape.
Finally, skrulls being compared to immigrants... subtle :-/ (in reality the skrulls aren't exactly good). I come to the movies for a break from all this. You want to get into politics, run for office otherwise it's just propaganda.
Final note, I'm so ready for someone to make fun of the scenes where she's standing up throughout her life before she breaks through the restraints. Here are some ideas, standing up out of a chair, standing up after tying your shoe, standing up after picking up a pencil, stand up after slipping on a banana peel, etc.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

I was highly concerned, because of the troll effect, but I'm so glad I didn't listen.
This movie was amazing from the beginning to the end. Brie Larson is Captain Marvel! Her character is super likable, powerful and sarcastic. She seems bland, because she doesn't know where she belongs, what her reality is or where her journey goes. We would all seem bland then. I really like the way they're going here. It has total potential of character development! I'm glad we'll get more to see of her.
Samuel L. Jackson and the Cat are great support actors, like the rest of them. The movie has nice easter eggs, a great tribute to Stan Lee, the perfect soundtrack, the right amount of humor, important credit scenes, A story and all around feel good-vibe. I'm hungry for more, and it serves as a good set up.
The audience was applauding afterwards. Fully deserved. If you want to troll, I allow you to be a troll. But to have the right of trolling, you are in need of seeing the movie first.

","Filled with complex characters and some good comedy, Captain Marvel comes off as a surprisingly good film amidst all the hate the movie has received by audiences and has certainly exceeded many expectations.
Brie Larson has done a good job as the main lead but the highlight of the movie was the adorable chemistry between the cat Goose and Nick Fury. The Kree-Skrull was good enough to invest your time in it and the plot-twist about the Skrulls is something you won't surely expect.
The writers dragged the movie's first act which was not at all a serious problem. Jude Law's character is quite complex but the problem is that he wasn't given enough screen time which was a huge mistake for you won't even remember the name of a character who had the potential to be as complex as Loki himself.
The Supreme Intelligence of The Krees' offered some character defining moments for Carol Danvers but that's all about the Krees, they weren't explored enough which could be done in the sequel.
Clarke Gregg's Agent Phil Coulson may not have much screen time but a couple of scenes were enough to build the trust Nick Fury has in him in the First Avengers' film or in the Agents Of The Shield T.V. Show.
Overall, the movie was far better than the mediocre Ant-Man movies which mean it is worth a watch.

Give it a watch, and remember, if you hadn't seen all the MCU movies yet, and this was the very first one you saw ... you'll appreciate the humor, love the play on emotions vs intellect, and a cute CGI cat. To see Young Fury depicted as a man that goes mushy over a feline & still innocent to the threats from the universe is a delight. Also the movie pays homage in a gasp !!action popcorn entertainment-film!! the love and friendship between Carol and Maria Rambeau, normally reserved for movies like Fried Green Tomatoes. I almost shed a tear (I did cry when Wonder Woman goes past the trenches with her shield and charges the enemy) when the movie cuts to all the times Carol is pushed down, falls down, and is told her place is elsewhere ... only to remember that she comes back up fighting, and in this movie and the next it won't be different.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","""Captain Marvel"" is probably the most hated MCU film, not for its quality but for outside reasons. I find pretty irrational and childish this behaviour but whatever. The movie by itself is good in all the aspects but in a mediocre way: nothing excels and at the same time nothing breaks it. In my opinion is very enjoyable and I've happily rewatched it few times. The biggest problem is the lack of memorability, there are maybe two or three scenes that I really appreciated. As far as the elephant in the room: the Marvel Studios have found a way not to make the feminist narrative prevalent and to be annoying. Instead Captain Marvel is powerful for a reason and not for being a girl (what do you think Rey?). Right, there could be the ""why"" she is the most powerful and not somebody else but I don't care because an explanation was given to the ""how"".

I think the superhero fatigue is starting to hit me because the first part of the film took me a bit to get into, but once she gets to Earth the story starts to pick up and is just as funny, entertaining and charming as every other recent Marvel film.

Greatly lacking character depth, being displayed as a one-dimensional ""Mary Sue"" with little to no backstory, human flaws, human struggles, or character growth.

I have found with many if not all superhero movies the plot gets lost, focusing to much on, power, strength, explosions fighting and breaking things. This is not the case with Capitain Marvel, the plot is well balanced with just the right amount of everything and a good well thought out thick story line, that keeps you pulled in an takes you on a emotional journey of ups and downs and moments that keep you on the edge of your seat and the character development of Capitan Marvel and the way she is portrayed is done so very well.

She's done this, done that but in the end she has unable to deliver all the hard work that she's been doing for the couple of months or year. Huge let down, i'd say.

I also thought that from the looks of the trailers, she would be less emotive. I was wrong on that. While she is powerful, she is by no means a Mary Sue. Her having amnesia and then going mixing for six years serves its purpose of that hurting other characters who were affected by her loss such as with her best friend from the Air Force Maria Rambeau, played by Lashana Lynch. Captain Marvel has emotions: she can be funny and snarky. She has moments where she felt conflicted about what she was doing, especially when she realizes that she couldn't trust anyone, not even those she was assigned to work with.

3735,18 June 2019,zidane_mohmad_1991,5," Why audiences hated ''Captain Marvel'' ?!
","If we compare ''Captain Marvel'' with others superheroes movies, we can conclude that ''Captain Marvel'' is the worst character story, all Marvel superheroes movies show the early life of superhero at the beginning, and then how he/she obtains the superpower as a forward story, but ''Captain Marvel'' started backwardly, at the beginning she already has a superpower, but she doesn't remember anything about how she got it, until the end when she finds out how she obtained it. I think the writers made a different a style of superhero movie to surprise the audience with some twist in the story, but they failed because it was a bad twist and no one surprised or impressed, they could make a wonderful, emotional and enjoyable movie if they just make it forward and clear (showing her early life, not as a flashback, until she becomes a ""Captain Marvel'').",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","This was the next entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the leading hero was called upon at the end of Avengers: Infinity War, but this is a prequel to how the whole Avengers project got started, and an origins story for the female hero, the first leading female in the series, directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (Half Nelson). Basically in 1995, on the planet of Hala, the capital of the Kree Empire, Starforce member Vers (Room's Brie Larson) is having recurring nightmares involving an older woman (Annette Bening). Her mentor and commander Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) trains her to control her abilities while the Supreme Intelligence, an artificial intelligence and the ruler of the Kree, urges her to control her emotions. The Kree are at war with the Skrulls, a race of alien shapeshifters, Vers is captured by their commander Talos (Ben Mendelsohn) during a mission to rescue an undercover operative infiltrating a Skrull group. She is taken aboard their vessel bound for the planet Earth and subjected to a memory probe. Vers escapes and crash-lands on Earth in Los Angeles in a Blockbuster store, she is found by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg). Their investigation is interrupted by a Skrull attack, following the chase, Vers recovers a crystal containing her extracted memories, while Fury kills a Skrull impersonating Coulson. Talos, disguised as S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Keller (also Mendelsohn), orders Fury to work with Vers and keep an eye on her. Fury takes Vers to a U.S. Air Force base and discovers she was a pilot presumed to have died in 1989. She was testing an experimental engine designed by Dr. Wendy Lawson, Vers recognises her as the woman from her nightmares. Talos and a S.H.I.E.L.D. tries to capture them, but they escape in a cargo jet, with Lawson's cat Goose. They fly to Louisiana to meet former pilot Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch), the last person to see Vers and Lawson alive. Just as Vers discovers her real name is Carol Danvers, Talos arrives at the Rambeau house, he reveals the Skrulls are refugees searching for a new home and Lawson was a renegade Kree scientist helping them. He then plays the recovered black box from Lawson's plane, prompting Danvers to remember the crash: Lawson was killed by Yon-Rogg before she could destroy the engine's energy-core, Danvers was forced to do so and absorbed the energy from the ensuing explosion, this is how she lost her memory. Danvers, Talos, Fury and Rambeau work together to locate Lawson's cloaked laboratory orbiting Earth, where Lawson hid several Skrulls including Talos' family, and the Tesseract, the source of the energy-core. Danvers is captured by Starforce and connects with the Supreme Intelligence, during their conversation she is able to access all her abilities, by removing the Kree implant that was suppressing her powers. In the subsequent battle, Fury retrieves Goose, who is revealed to be an alien with a pocket dimension inside her body and swallows the Tesseract before scratching Fury's left eye, permanently blinding it. Danvers, who earns the nickname Captain Marvel, leaves to help find a new homeworld for the Skrulls and gives Fury a modified pager to contact her in an emergency. Meanwhile, Fury drafts an initiative aimed at locating heroes like her, with abilities, he changes the name of the project after seeing a photo of Danvers in her Air Force jet, which bears the call sign ""Avenger"". In the mid-credits sequence, set in the present day, Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans), Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Bruce Banner aka Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and James Rhodes aka War Machine (Don Cheadle), the remaining Avengers, are monitoring the pager that Fury activated before his disintegration, Danvers appears and demands to know where Fury is. In the post-credits sequence, back in 1995, Goose jumps onto Fury's desk and regurgitates the Tesseract. Also starring Rune Temte as Bron-Char, Gemma Chan as Minn-Erva, Algenis Perez Soto as Att-Lass, Djimon Hounsou as Korath, Lee Pace as Ronan, Chuku Modu as Soh-Larr, Matthew Maher as Norex, Kenneth Mitchell as Carol's Father, Mckenna Grace as Young Carol (13 Years Old), London Fuller as Young Carol (6 Years Old), Colin Ford as Steve Danvers, Robert Kazinsky as Biker (The Don), Marilyn Brett as Older Lady on Train and Stan Lee (who sadly passed away from cancer) has a posthumous cameo as himself reading the script for his role in Mallrats, the opening Marvel Studios logo also honours his memory with clips of his cameos and on-set moment, and the words ""Thank You Stan"". Larson is well chosen as the feisty human-turned-alien heroine, Jackson is terrific and the younger future director of the Avengers, the verbal sparring between Larson and Jackson make for some highlights, and there is good support from Mendelsohn, Law and Bening. The references to the 1990s time period are clever, the special effects are amazing, especially to make Jackson twenty years younger, it does slow down at times for the necessary chat sequences, but there are enough small giggles, it packs a punch with the explosive and exciting fight and chase sequences, and it sets you up nicely for Avengers: Endgame, a fun superhero fantasy action adventure.

The Kree are shown afraid from the skulls and that they're invading planet after planet so the accusers, including yon-rogg, carol, korath try and stop them but then Carol gets abducted by the skrull. Then the skrull tamper with her memories and try to find Doctor Minerva (Captain Mar-Vell) but then carol escapes when she does her ship falls to earth. Nick fury then sees her and starts asking her questions, she then explains who the skrull and kree are. After a couple of skrull attacks, Talos explains to carol that they're not the bad guys, and that the kree want to wipe them out because the skrulls don't want to submit to them. When carol knows aboht this she helps Talos find the ship his family is hiding on, and where the tesseract is also located, Yon-rogg tracks her down and tells Ronan the accuser that the skrulls are on earth, then Carol is captured again and the kree try to mind control her, but she breaks out and destroys all their ships.

Sadly, Brie Larson was so flat as a character, that I never found myself rooting for her, or otherwise caring in any way.

Brie Larson is fine in the role, but isn't given a ton to work with. The film is pretty standard in that it has the reliable Marvel action and humor to keep it afloat without ever taking too many risks, a la most Phase One films. Not that Phase One MCU movies are bad, and Captain Marvel certainly isn't bad, it simply comes across as being just..... fine. It's style and tone don't really help it stand out in an increasingly populated MCU and it isn't quite the prelude to Endgame I think a lot of people were hoping for.

It was the first time in my life that I fell asleep on a movie because it was boring at a point where staring at a wall seemed more interesting. Another aspect of the movie that was really frustrating was the feminism part. The movie clearly wanted to point out that the director as well as the lead actress hated the existence of men.

Touted as Marvel's response to the fantastic Wonder Woman movie, Captain Marvel fell well short of that mark, mostly due to the dreariness of Captain Marvel/Vres/Carol Danvers. I'm not going to dump it totally on Brie Larson, because the directors are also responsible to get the actor to their vision. If their vision was to have her act like a ""tank"" then they succeeded. I was in the army and thought tanks were great to follow into combat, but I really didn't have emotional attachment to them. Which is the way I feel about Captain Marvel, if Thanos rips off her head and spits down her throat in Endgame, I would just shrug, thank that it wasn't any of the other Marvel characters that actually have charisma.

3901,6 March 2019,Troy_Campbell,6," Lower-tiered Marvel, but still fun.
","Set prior to where the Marvel Cinematic Universe is currently at, this instalment serves as an origin story for amnesic Kree warrior Vers, an impulsive, resilient badass intent on figuring out her muddled memories whilst bringing down the planet-destroying Skrull race. There has been a lot made out about the fact this is the first female-led Marvel movie, but unsurprisingly, they succeed (and why wouldn't they?) in delivering a central protagonist as compelling, complex and charismatic as any male lead. Oscar winner Brie Larson is a good fit for the brazen space agent, imbuing her with a resolve that only strengthens when her vulnerabilities come to the fore. She's also just straight up a cool, kickass hero. Which makes it a shame that the strangely underwhelming action places this squarely into lower-tier MCU territory. There's certainly not a lack of set pieces, but none of them are memorable. Even the climactic sky-soaring sequence showing off the enormity of our lead's powers doesn't pack the punch you would expect. This franchise loves tapping into different genres to tell their superhero stories, this one riffing on the buddy-cop formula with Larson's outer-space operstive teaming up with Samuel L Jackson's SHIELD agent to exchange barbs and build an emotional relationship. It's awkward and forced to start with, but they warm up as the film progresses. The pre-Avengers Fury is less enlightened and experienced than as we've come to know him, but, with that trademark Jackson swagger, he's no less confident of himself. De-aging technology continues to evolve at an impressive rate too, a mid-90s Jackson extremely convincing, Elsewhere there's an amusing turn by Ben Mendelsohn as Skrull soldier Talos, a relatively one-note performance by Jude Law as Kree officer Yon-Rogg, and some class brought by Hollywood royalty Annette Bening as the Supreme Intelligence. This series sets a high bar in the blockbuster arena and Captain Marvel can't quite clear it, but comparisons aside this is still a fun adventure with a riveting hero at the centre of it all.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

Disney and Marvel have done a tremendous job of creating a cinematic universe out of Marvel universe. They've truely made Superhero films mainstream. But Captain Marvel is a big misfire from the dependable combo. Captain Marvel is not really a great comic book character to begin with. She is a stale and boring in comics. Now Disney have decided to cast Brie Larson as Captain Marvel. Brie is a decent actress, but this role required an exceptional talent to improve the stake character from comics. Imagine a lead like Robert Downey Jr, how he improved the character of Tony Stark from comics. Brie on the other hand has played that she bland character in comics. Also Captain Marvel is so over powered that Marvel now has a Superman problem. Thanos doesn't look like a threat anymore, Captain Marvel alone can easily fight and defeat him. The story in this movie has been a mess. On the top of that they revealed the reason behind Fury wearing eye patch. And they completely ruined it as well.

I've never read Captain Marvel comics but I love the character as she is portrayed in this movie. She's awesome, she's fearless, she's badass but she's also humane, vulnerable and empathetic.

3972,20 April 2019,paulofro,8," Fresh breath of air from Marvel
","Captain Marvel, is a breath of fresh air for the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Not only is this the first MCU theatrical movie with a female lead, but it's also the start of a new era of Avengers as many of the original actors for the MCU films have their contracts ending. For an industry dominated by mostly male actors, Brie Larson definitely wows many with her portrayal of the all-powerful Kree warrior, Captain Marvel.
The film follows the alien warrior Vers of the Kree, an empire of super-powered individuals that are on an ongoing battle with the Skrulls, shape-shifting aliens, portrayed by Brie Larson. Vers (Larson) struggles with her memories and control of her temper, which is exasperated by her reliance of her powers of energy projection from her fists, much to the annoyance of her mentor, Yon-Rogg, played by Jude Law. After being given the ok to join in a mission to recover a Kree spy who was captured by enemies, everything goes wrong and Vers finds herself captured. Vers eventually escapes her captors and lands on Earth during the 90s and we witness humorous scenes of a fully uniformed Kree warrior interacting with people on Earth. After meeting a much younger Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), she teams up with him to try and stop the Skrulls invading Earth but along the way finds out more about her past, which may hold the key to saving the world.
The movie begins a new era of superheroes, and with a female lead, is also revolutionary and empowering to women. Not only the female lead, but when the film was released, Marvel chose to do so during International Women's Day, February 8th 2019. Such a release is so empowering because again, Captain Marvel is the first female lead superhero movie new to the MCU, and with that we also get one of the most powerful contenders in the movie universe. The movie also released two months before Avengers: End Game, where Captain Marvel may set the pace of the movie, being able to go toe-to-toe with the powerful villain, Thanos; and after the end of Avengers: Infinity War, where we are first teased at the existence of Captain Marvel.
The film is not without its faults, as Brie Larson's character has to deal with her memory loss and thus limits her potential to portray her character. With the nature of the film being prequel to all the Marvel movies, we don't see any solid character development until well after the middle of the movie, when originally we only have this angry sarcastic superhero with memory loss. With the way the movie sets the history of its characters, this is an unconventional way of portraying an origin story, so many may be confused for a good portion of the film. I hope to see further character development for Captain Marvel. The film left a need to see more of Captain Marvel in action, now that we know the full capabilities of her powers.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

Sam Jackson was great with what they gave him, but Nick Fury has never been full comic support. That threw me off a little.

The storyline is literally nothing like the old comics and I'd argue that this story is much less enjoyable, but it's still fine.

","I really liked the retrospect and the effects were great. As a superhero, Captain Marvel was rather modest but also interesting, there was no MCU movie with a woman in the main role. However, Brie Larson did well in her role In the movie there were also funny elements where I could laughed well, but that was not so often. Jackson tried to show his funny side of Fury and I think he did it well, he was very different than in the films before.He and Gregg both have been able to give their ""younger selves"" a character which have a deep impact on the chronologically later films / series. The end of the film, I found rather unspectacular as far as Fury and an important animal are concerned, have more The rogue (s) were different than I had hoped and therefore disappointed me. Captain Marvel's costume is well done and the colors look good on her.The music was perfect, as there are both exciting film music and pop / rock music from the 90s, which again underlines the time back then, 1995, and makes you feel more into the time.Actually in the fight scenes fits this music super pure.
The film is perfect for anyone who loves sci-fi, action and Marvel films. Larson symbolizes a strong woman, which is why the film has a positive impact on many people in my opinion. Theoretically, you can watch the film without any prior knowledge on the previous ones Watching movies, apart from the post-credit scene.
I give the film 7 out of 10 points. He was good but not really special. But definitely worth seeing.

4026,9 April 2020,djbrown-00897,7," A Good Movie
","Captain Marvel is a good movie. It is not Wonder Woman or Into The Spider-Verse, but it is not Batman and Robin or Howard The Duck either. Most people know the story of Carol Danvers ( Captain Marvel), and ( or) they have read posters who have dissected the story, so there is no need to repeat the plot. I will just comment. There are three positive things that stand out things. 1: ""Goose"" The Cat. The cat stole every scene he was in. 2: The process that made Nick and Phil look decades younger. 3: The twist showing Scrulls as victims and the Kree as bad guys. In the Fantastic Four comic, they were the bad guys. In fact, one of them ( Super Scrull) is in the top 10 of FF villains. My biggest complaint is there was nothing tragic involved, to make the story great, Carol was complaining how she lost 6 years of her life, but that is nothing compared to Diana Prince (Wonder Woman) who lost the man she loves and her mom, Miles Morales ( Into The Spider-Verse) his Uncle, or even The Avengers losing Tony Stark ( Iron Man) and Natasha Romanoff ( Black Widow) in Avengers: Endgame. In the comics, quite often, the best super-hero stories involve death. In Amazing Spider-Man you have the deaths of Uncle Ben and Gwen Stacy, and the individual stories Kraven's Last Hunt and The Kid Who Collected Spider-Man, and the Death of Jean DeWolff are tragic stories, that are always listed along with the deaths of Uncle Ben and Gwen in the Top 10 Spider-Man issued ever. That lack of anything tragic is the difference between good and great. I would ordinarily give it 6/10 stars ( between fair and good) but Goose gives it an extra star, to elevate Captain Marvel into a good movie.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

I had little care for the side characters and the villain was mediocre at best, my favourite character was the cat.
I thought Brie Larson was relatively good in this slug-fest but she had nothing else to support her, except Sam L Jackson who was the star. He did make me crack some smiles in this film, and a laugh, suggesting the 2 hours was not a total bore.

Somehow this movie is 2 hours long and manages almost zero character development or interpersonal emotional connection, mostly relagated to awful cliche moments.

What was holding her before? No one can tell. And even this new perspective she comes with in the end feels so unearned... Btw, the way she says ""My name is Carol"", I was palm facing so much, I dug a whole into my scull. Also the feminist side is really forced as well. Feminism in this film is as superficial as it gets. There are no real issues, just slogans and insults like ""human male: harmless"". This is not feminism, that's exploiting feminism for cheap advertising. Battles with 90s popular songs? It took me out of the film immediately.

","I am not the biggest superhero film fan in the World, but I've seen most of them on DVD. I catch a few at the cinema, but this is the first one I've totally regretted spending the money on.
The writing and pacing of the film is off, the title character's "" journey"" is completely uninvolving. I never once cared about the heroine of this movie or what happens to them. There are moments when we should feel for Captain Marvel but they just fall flat. The relationship between Carol Danvers and her best friend is nothing.
Brie Larson is miscast. She looks bored in every scene that she is in. I am told that she is a talented actress , and that may well be true, but I've only ever seen her in King Kong: Skull Island and this film and she is terrible in both of them.
Worst of all, for a movie of this type, Larson is a charisma vacuum. She doesn't take the audience with her at all.
The character is also just too powerful. When , at the end of the film, she has to fight and destroy her former friends she doesn't seem to feel anything as she effortlessly wipes them out. It's like playing a video game in cheat mode, there is no real difficulty, you just keep shooting until you win.
It's a shame because some elements really work. The villain, played wonderfully by Ben Mendehlson ( spelling?) is excellent and Samuel Jackson and Clark Gregg both shine. I was reminded of how much I missed Gregg's character ( I don't watch the TV show in which he appears).
The humour doesn't work because Brie Larson can't do comedy.

Jackson shines as a less serious and younger Fury, and Ben Mendelsohn is great as the skrull leader Talos. I've seen some people call Brie's acting bad, and I dont really think that. She's extremely nuanced in her performance, which I think illustrates how Carol is trying to find out who she really is, and struggles between her kree training of never showing emotion and her human nature.

4175,27 February 2020,holyshiteverynamehasbeentaken,6," This is not a bad movie.It's mediocre.
","Okay, let's get straight into the point.
This film lacks:
-tension
-characterization
-genuineness
WELL...these three elements are often interconnected, as good characterization leads to sincerity, genuineness leads you, the viewer, to care for the story and the characters, therefore creating tension. It's all a loop. Sic Mundus creatus est.
ANYWAY...Captain Marvel failed at all three, which is not a good sign.
Characterization is one of the most criticized aspects of this film. Captain Marvel was sloppily written, as we don't feel anything for her. Not a single thing. First off, they made her far too perfect, as if she's some goddess from an ancient myth. She has no conflict, external or internal. Can she lose? No. Can she fear? No.Does she even has a flaw? Nope!
As a result, her character feels unrelatable, and eventually, bland and boring.
THERE'S barely any tension in this film for a couple of reasons. The bad characterization definitely isn't helping, but the main problem is the fact that the film never tries to up its stakes. The characters are always in control, they're always confident, the villain is always losing, these are the kind of things that really, really kill the tension in the air by sucking it out with a vacuum cleaner. The film does try to create some(alright, a little) tension by giving the protagonist amnesia. Unfortunately, it doesn't quite work thanks to One.this method is overused and Two.it fails to have an impact on the character as hoped.
FINALLY, this film is not genuine. It feels superficial in many aspects, which include the character arcs, the storyline, the visuals, everything, which is a direct repercussion of the issues mentioned above.
Overall, the film remains enjoyable for those who don't mind the problems mentioned above. Brie Larson and Samuel Jackson have good chemistry with each other, and the visuals are neatly done. Unfortunately,this doesn't change the fact that this film is far too flawed, and can be considered as a weaker entry into the MCU.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

Nothing stands out. I don't even understand why this movie was made. The only silver lining is hopefully this shows Marvel that shoe-horning a character into a story 10 years in the making a month before the finale is not a good idea. Couple that with HORRIBLE acting and a forced feminist agenda that people go to movies to forget about for 2 hours and TADAAA. You have this dumpster fire movie.

","To start, none of the feminist tones sway my decision, in fact those are the one box this film manage to attempt and actually accomplish. If you were unaware this film was gonna be heavy in that regard, you don't get out much.
That being said, it's just not good. The excitement throughout the film intensifies to the peak of a kitchen countertop. The dialogue is not only clunky and forced, it does nothing to make you care about any of the characters. You know what kind of nostalgia is gear in film? The kind where there is so much you enjoy spotting some, almost as if you wonder ""did anyone else catch it too?"" Not the kind where it's one at a time and blatantly forced in your face and thus more of a distraction than an added nuance.
If you feel you need to see this film prior to Avengers: Endgame, short answer is no. Nothing in this film, other than Carol Danvers poorly developed origin story, is of any value to Endgame.

Being ""Just a Girl"" certainly isn't doing her any favors in this, I can tell you that. Guardians of the Galaxy, Captain America 1 and Agent Carter did 'proto-retroism' in Marvel movies/shows very right, with their fine selection of music and moody sci/fi-40's production designs respectively, but it's disappointing how they failed to follow through for our trip to a more recognizable, grounded and less distant past.

4245,12 March 2019,auritone,4," Captain Miss-Fire
","Well, it had to happen at one point, didn't it.
Captain Marvel is not a bad movie, just a terribly mediocre one.
The problems that lead to this are many, but I find that at the heart of it is the fact that it tries to juggle several things at the same time without ever really managing to do any of them well.
Juggling an origin story with a fish out of water story; a body cop narrative along with the overall plot of the war between the Kree and the Skrull, while at the same time trying to tie it into the main Avengers plotline (and the MC universe), is all a bit much. When we then add a plotline where Carol Danvers tries to reconstruct the memories of her lost past, nothing is ever really given enough time to have any meaningful impact.
To make matters even worse, the character of Capt. Marvel suffers greatly from this. After spending almost two hours with Carol Danvers, I still have no idea who she actually is, and when the movie reached its climax, all I was left with was a superhero flying around shooting lasers from her hands, while looking like an overenthusiastically decorated Christmas tree. I never felt close to the character because the movie simply failed to get me emotionally engaged. This could have been rectified if they had focused more on her reconstructing her past, thereby giving us a chance to connect with her, making a sequence of her getting knocked down and standing up again meaningful. When you have such an overpowered character as Capt. Marvel, you have to compensate for her lack of physical endangerment with some kind of personal stakes, and Capt. Marvel has none of that. The lack of characterization is quite surprising when you consider that Marvel up until this point have been quite good at giving us interesting characters.
Besides from that, there are some outright cringe worthy ""Solo"" moments, where we are told the backstory of things that never needed explanations in the first place. Remember how the Solo movie, for some reason, thought it prudent to tell us how Han got his surname and his blaster? Yes, we get that in Capt. Marvel, and it is just as bad and equally pointless!
Now, there are some good moments in this movie, but they are sadly not many, and when you add bad characterization too that, we are left with a movie that has the same satisfaction as a McDonald's cheeseburger. It does not taste all that good, and when you burp you are hungry again.
Sorry, but if you want to see a female superhero then watch Wonder Woman instead.

I hope this isn't an indication of the direction the MCU is taking in the future.
Also the blatant disregard for the original Mar-vell by sex changing him!? What? That doesn't make any sense. Would Stan Lee and Gene Colan approve?
I feel sorry for the current cast of Avengers in Infinity war. They have been working on and building up the MCU for over a decade, and now they get to have some unknown random character come in and save them!? I really hope EndGame isn't Captain Marvel walking up to Thanos, smirking at him while doing a Hulk Hogan leg drop on him, effectively beating him, and winning.

","While the teasers & trailers indicated a very routine & ordinary superhero flick with a cliched formula, the movie surprisingly turned out quite decent & fairly entertaining. Obviously it could have been better with a better script & director(s) who could have play with the story arc more creatively but overall it was a fine addition to the franchise. There are worse films than this already in MCU and at least it didn't feel like a tie-in episode like Ant-man & the Wasp. Expected more from Nick Fury's contribution here, other than mostly being a comic relief and surely his lost eye deserved a way better backstory. Goose the cat was a nice surprise though.

It's also such a funny movie which I was not expecting given the general dark tone of the mcu at this point (even though this movie occurs prior to current events). The villains were interesting despite not being as big as thanos, because of how much time and growth is required for Carol to be a capable match for them. It has enough twists and turns to keep you on your feet, but without leaving you thinking ""what the heck did I just watch??""

","The film introduces us to Captain (Brie Larson) on the planet of the Kree, an alien race that has its own ""space police"". The protagonist, who has amnesia and does not remember anything before her life as a warrior, is part of one of the squadrons responsible for hunting Skrulls, a rival race that is able to transform into any living being that can see. During a mission, I can only say that ""everything goes wrong"" and our heroine is stranded alone on Earth, searching for one of the Skrull leaders before he is able to threaten all life in the universe, the film is still a very fun and exciting adventure as the captain strives to save the universe as he gradually discovers more details of his past. In addition, various comments are made about how women are treated by our society, some of which are relevant to the present day. It is important to remember that the actress is perfect on paper, she exudes charisma in every scene, the side effects of each scene enchants me, leaves me interspersed in the film, there is a specific scene in which she says nothing, but her body language is so expressive, that it is amazing to see in action. There was no one better for this role.
Each special effect of the film one more more satisfying than the other, one moment of the film that most marked for me was the part that the cat transforms into an exotic animal, but I found the effect of the film sensational, from the beginning to the end of the movie was perfect, I sure loved the movie, it's okay to watch it again.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","Captain Marvel isn't a bad film. While I vehemently dislike Brie Larson, her acting talent is more than serviceable for this film. My real issues with it come from the lackluster story. Spoilers ahead.
The entire beggining of the movie shows Captain Marvel (CM) as a member of the Kree starforce thinking of herself as a Kree (utterly pointless as anyone familiar with the MCU will already know she is human. She has magic powers that she is told she has been given by the Supreme Intelligence, powers which can be taken away. (this isn't true, she got her powers from an explosion. or maybe the supreme intelligence can take them away but it wasn't made very clear.
Anyway the whole story is kinda pointless, you have the Skrulls who spend the first half of the movie trying to kill Captain Marvel and to infiltrate earth. Then they pull the old ""the guys you thought were bad were good"" which just makes the movie more confusing. I don't know if Skrulls are meant to have already have been established as a race in the MCU before this but I can't remember them at all and spent the first half of the movie asking "" who are these space goblin elf men?"". There isn't really a villain in this movie, after having a villain like Thanos, you can't just use some weird man with strange eyes and expect that to be a compelling villain.
Only went to see this to prepare for endgame, wasn't disappointed as I wasn't expecting Infinity War level quality. But this movie is on the level of Thor 2 in terms of how dull it was, at least Thor 2 had a central villain.
In conclusion, it's not good, but its a long shot from the worst film I've ever seen. One of the weaker Marvel films but not every movie is created equally.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","Wow - talk about a blunder. Marvel movies (except Avengers Infinity Wars) have progressively been getting worse and worse, but Captain Marvel is one of the worse superhero movies of all time. Yes - one of the worse. Worse than Green Lantern, worse than Electra, worse that Batman vs Superman, and even worse than Daredevil.
So what is so bad about it?
Let's start with acting: Brie Larson is a highly touted actress since her role in Room. Now playing a superhero does not take a lot of effort - but you have to make an effort to be likeable. Brie is so wooden and dull that she actually is a hinderance to the film. If you want a comparison: she makes George Clooney look great as Batman - or Jennifer Garner look like an Oscar winner as Electra - yes folks she is that god awful.
The best performance in the entire film is - the cat. That is sad.
Annette Benning is also wooden, dry and unlikeable as Captain Mar-vel.
The flow of the movie is awful. You keep wondering how a movie with so much action is so boring. It flows poorly and it is not well directed.
The script is terrible. Some of the scenes are just plain stupid - for one (spoiler) the cat is an alien that shoots out tentacles - rip off of The Thing, Tremors, Stranger Things - but what is so dumb is that this 12 pound cat tosses out (which is physically impossible) about five tentacles that are human size from its maw - the cat would have had to grow to the size of an elephant to do that and after it does that and it devours multiple humanoids you see it still in Fury's arms as a small cat.
The film makers took an obsolete Marvel character that most people did not know and butchered it - destroyed the heart of who Captain Marvel (Miss Marvel) to those who have read the books. The film makers knew nothing of the Marvel universe and it showed:
1- Miss Marvel came over 20 years after the Avengers - but in this movie her call sign (as a pilot) was Avenger and Fury takes that as inspiration - that is a big eye roller.
2- Fury does NOT lose his eye from a cat scratch. That was beyond stupid and the fact that the cat was still in his possession after it tears his eye out makes no sense. The entire eye clawing scene made no sense.
3- Captain Mar-vel was a great warrior who fought against the Skrulls. Grab The Death of Captain Mar-vel by Jim Starlin - great book - the only time a superhero dies from cancer. Yes, from cancer- not from being shot by a traitor.
4- The Skrull are the Marvel version of terrorists and evil. In this movie we make them heroes. That just destroys the entire Marvel universe in one shot. But in this politically correct culture you can see someone's agenda being pushed - like making today's terrorists the heroes.

Samuel L. Jackson was the best performer by far, but this movies plot/writing has ruined his character. Fury was the 'head honcho' of Shield and Avengers who had presence and weight, but here he is portrayed as being inspired by Captain Marvel even tho she didn't earn that level of adoration whatsoever.

That's how she was portrayed here, an over powered female heroine that can take on anything that is thrown at her. That's not a hero, that's just someone who is better than everyone else, and worst of all she knows it. I want to know more about her adversity in the military, how she had to to dig deep in order to combat an entire empire feeding her lies! But no, she barely breaks a sweat fending of an entire armada. This was a decent movie but a very sub-par Superhero Movie.

","It's about time. It's about time we got a female superhero in a superhero movie that's actually good. At least in the MCU. What's more, it's about time we got a movie in which the protagonist is adept at not only action-movie dialog but also the normal-movie stuff - you know, acting. Carol Danvers isn't meant to be the savior of the female box-office draws. She's not some stand in for feminism, she IS feminism. She is powerful before gaining any superhero powers. She's all the qualities you'd expect to see in any superhero, but the fact that she's female isn't played as an asset in and of itself - why, it's as if she were a fleshed-out character who just happens to be female. Maybe that's not really a hot take, but it's mine. And Brie Larson is the perfect choice to play her. If you thought her work in Room and Short Term 12 and others was a fluke, this should dispel those notions. Now, for the rest of the movie. The only real problem I have with it is that it's a little too easy to see the double crosses or triple crosses coming. It's too easy to see who the bad guy really is. That's not much of a debit, in the grand scheme of things. Take the first several scenes, in which Danvers, I mean Vers, is with a group of Kree led by Jude Law. I knew none of these characters, and yet I was entranced by their shenanigans. A lot of this is due to, again, Larson, who seemingly willed clarity to the weirdness, but it also has a lot to do with the writing. I thought the nods to the 1990s were fantastic and spot on, including the music choices. I thought the acting was universally solid, and I loved seeing Annette Bening.

4532,17 March 2019,mariagbland,7," Pretty good!
","I'm fresh out of the theater, and probably need to watch the film again to make my final verdict, but overall, the movie was MUCH better than expected. I had kept on hearing all of the hate for the movie, and I was worried that this film might seem to feministic (and note that I'm a girl too, so that's saying something), but I didn't see many blaring scenes of ""too much"" of that.
The intro with the Marvel logo and Stan Lee got me crying at the beginning before the movie even started, and I just thought it was such a touching tribute to the grand creator of this universe.
I also will mention my favorite part of the film; Talos. Talos was as good of a villain in the beginning as an ally at the end. He perfectly acted by Ben Mendelsohn, and was hilarious and a lot of scenes, while scary in others, and heartfelt and warming in the rest. He was such a well-rounded character that I left the theater already begging for more scenes with him! I loved the scene in the spaceship with the gang taking off towards the lab and the rest of the characters are bugging him about turning into random things like filing cabinets and Venus fly traps!
There were a few nitpick scenes that I would have wanted fixed, but the main one was the final battle. It was too easy. WAY too easy. When they started out the final battle with Ronan sending missiles to earth, there was a true feeling of danger, but right at the beginning of the attack, she caught one of the missiles (yes, with difficulty) and threw it back. The scene of her throwing the missile was inspiring, but the excitement died when that one missile somehow bumped into and destroyed every last one of the other missiles. This chain effect may have or may not have been realistic (I don't know how missiles work obviously), but it was extremely easy-peasy and anticlamactic. The fight scene with her in the ship with her former Kree companions was way too overpowered, and though there were some really good action sequences and occasionally a tiny struggle, she shrugged off the obstacles and opponents with ease. I love a good struggle. I loved how in Thor Ragnarok, though Thor is really powerful, his enemy is with rivaling power. In Captain Marvel's case, the enemy had disproportionate power and was no match for Carol's girl power! Don't get me wrong- I enjoyed the sequences, yes, but to be honest, I felt a little cheated by how easy it was for her. I wanted a real struggle. Yeah, there was a little bit of a struggle between her and the Supreme Intelligence, but all Carol needed to do was peel of the obedience disk and beat the Intelligence up.
But don't misunderstand me. It was only this final fight scene that bugged me. Practically everything else I enjoyed. Carol's personality might have seemed a little bit prideful or whatever, but people are like that in real life, so who am I to complain?
The visuals were fantastic. The side characters were awesome, and the Skrulls were by far my favorite part of the film.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

She is also too powerful which takes away any suspense or sense of danger. Dragged on for what seemed like forever in some parts and was flat out boring.

Deaf people rejoice. That said, S.L.Jackson and Jude Law were as always in a league of their own and the CGI was almost PERFECT.
Worst decision ever to cast Brie as the most powerful avenger.
I entered the cinema without any kind of prejudices (of course the incredible high-level of the Marvel movies did create some expectations) since I have only read about the debacle regarding ""the old white males"" after seeing the movie. And since I myself am not a man this wouldn't have affected me anyways.. Still, biggest letdown of the past few years.

","This movie provides a nuanced take on the origin story trope. It lays bare the ""white saviour"" narrative twice over and holds up a mirror to US overseas imperialism and attitudes to refugees.
The Danvers character is a unique addition to MCU and while others compare her to Stark, she is sassy and smartmouthed without the destructive intent of the fundamentally damaged Stark.
Some may see Danvers as having little character development and this may be true but the mode of storytelling is such that any development over the course of the movie would simply obfuscate the point of the audience's journey to learn who she really is behind that confident facade.
The origin story of Nick Fury is included but more expository than Danvers.

4631,14 March 2019,alienposer-99565,9," Really good movie.
","Wow, I watched Captain marvel, and I'm not shocked, but really surprised at all the bad reviews it's received. Now, everyone is certainly entitled to their own opinion, but I'd have to say, I disagreed with most of the negative stuff I read. Guess I don't have a gift at looking at it from an ""artistic"" perspective. I pretty much take it at face value.
Come-on folks. It's a comic book movie. It's all totally made up, and to say that the characters just aren't believable is an absurd statement. IT'S FAKE!!!
To say Captain marvel had no weaknesses? That's silly. Her first weakness was overcoming herself. She was just introduced. Who knows what her weaknesses are. Hulk had no weaknesses. He just comes in and wrecks shop. He throws punches, and gets punched, but up until he, kinda fought Thanos, he never really had a challenge. He just smashed. Captain America has no weakness. He fights till he wins. He gets beat up, gets inspired, and defeats his adversary. Same with Captain marvel. She had to learn who she was, overcome her fears, and realize her true powers. She got beat up plenty thought the movie. Y'all talk like it's the end. It's just starting with her. I'm pretty confident she won't just come in and destroy the bad guy and that's it. We will probably see more weaknesses as the story unfolds further. In ""age of Ultron"", vision had no weakness. He had no struggle. He just wrecked the bad guy. As his character develops, you see he has plenty of weaknesses. I'm sure the same will be true of Captain marvel.
I'm certainly not ""hoping"" for a strong female hero. But I'm not opposed to it. Look at black widow. She's pretty freakin bad (bad meaning awesome). To say that the only people that could actually like this movie are just looking for a strong female hero is silly. I liked the movie a lot. And I'm sure, it would have been just as great if Captain marvel was a dude.
As a matter of fact, I might go so far as to say that the reason a lot of people gave such horrible reviews was because (emphasis on because) she was a woman. Not because having a woman hero is bad, but because, I'd bet there's a lot of people out there who were really hoping marvel would really knock it out of the park with a female hero, to prove to the would that women can be super awesome too, and it just didn't measure up to their hopes and expectations.
And who cares if, at the beginning of the movie, she was on the side of a known villain? You're only assuming Ronan is bad when she's fighting with the Cree. Maybe something would have happened during the movie that would have made him turn bad. Thor fought along side Loki, after Loki tried to kill or enslave everyone on the planet. But you can look back after watching, wanting to find things wrong with it, and say ""That's stupid. She was fighting with Ronan, and he's a bad, bad putty tat. What a stupid movie"".
To sum up, (not that my opinion matters a whole lot anyway) I thoroughly enjoyed Captain marvel. There, I said it. I enjoyed the background storyline. I enjoyed the action scenes. I enjoyed the character development. I enjoyed the plot sequence. I thought Brie Larson did a fine job of portraying a kind, compassionate, sarcastic, fun loving, bad-a$$ super heroine, with ""seemingly"" limitless power and no apparent weaknesses. I just enjoyed it. I could pick apart, and say this didn't make sense, or that doesn't line up with that, or whatever. But it's a comic book movie. It's fun to watch. That's why I give it a 9.

So much things left unexplained such as:
When she admit that she is only ordinary human but why she doesn't die when such powerfull core energy hit her?
How can she has the power like superman (when she lifted the giant alien spaceship) whilst she only has the ""heat"" from core energy?? lol
Where are goose come from? etc...
Moreover, I really don't like the way she fight and use the power.. it seems like she Has no weakness and all enemies are easy for her, such setting even makes me less respect to this character and suddenly my curiouscity gone.. :(

Each movie pocesses certain problems but it is the issues dealt with beyond the screen that gains such respects. Directly this movie serves as a commentary toward the dynamics of warfare and indirectly toward empowering female figures. On a rather negative note, this movie is not without its faults. I felt numerous plot holes where established to which the comics could provide no justification nor aid given the creation of a new plotline. Brie Larson's performance is lighthearted, whitty and distinguished. Her costume presents a pleasing nod to the comics as well as establishing a uniqueness within the cinematic universe. Samuel Jackson provides a great dynamic shared with Ms.Larson allowing for comedic relief as well as explanatory context for the previous films. Given my lower expectations and perhaps inpatient anticipation for Endgame; I was pleasantly surprised.

And that's saying something, considering there have been numerous videos with ""leaks"" and ""fan theories"" on a daily basis for the past year, they somehow managed to keep the film's plot away from all that. The film had some more ""serious"" and ""deep"" moments, they kept it away from any ""dame in distress"" or ""woman needs man to save her"" moments (very much appreciated, even poor WW didn't manage to stay away from romance), and it had an overall light humor (granted it's nowhere near Thor Ragnarok but it still works). CGI work was amazing and yes it made you believe both Jackson's and Gregg's younger versions were real (again they didn't have any huge feat to accomplish like adding/removing mustaches and so on...) and the cat was simply priceless!

The action is great too, since she's one of the most powerful Avengers, so I would expect to be some good action and there is.

","They could have done so much more with Captain Marvel especially with all the hype pre-release. Her powers/abilities are never properly explained and its use throughout the movie is inconsistent. She never really faced a formidable foe to be declared by the creators as 'THE STRONGEST' character in MCU and I couldn't connect with her gaining those powers at all. Look at Thor. He was already a GOD, who lost it all and then earned back his power and more. And all that great storytelling was thrown away with a few nonsensical statements about Captain Marvel. Nick Fury who I respected so much as a formidable spy character, was shown as a funny guy just to make Captain Marvel look badass. This was another bad move. Samuel Jackson did a wonderful job, no doubt, but I don't see him as the same fearsome, mysterious Nick Fury who recruited the Avengers anymore.
Comedy felt a bit forced, especially during the last act of the movie. I know they were going for girl-power, and almost did a very good job with it. I especially liked the part where they show Carol getting up every time she falls. But to show other established badass characters as weak just to one up Captain Marvel got tiring to watch.

4714,2 February 2020,romanosdaniel,2," Marvel goes woke...
","I enjoyed the MCU very much. It told superhero stories which were interesting and fun. I loved the Infinity War setup, and whilst Endgame had some cringe scenes (notably one specific one that was more sexist than anything I have ever seen), it was still a fantastic movie.
However, the addition of Captain Marvel to the MCU has been utterly appalling.
The original Captain Marvel was a man. Carol Danvers was Miss Marvel and I liked her as Miss Marvel very much. Danvers didn't appear as Captain Marvel until 2012 by which time Marvel Comics were beginning to fall off a cliff.
When will Disney, a supposedly family friendly company, understand that there is a reason the MCU is based more on the older stories. Its because they were better stories and not full of this PC rubbish.
Captain Marvel is not very heroic. She is a Mary Sue even though she was a product of what seems like relatively low grade technology compared to what is available throughout the MCU. Certainly I have no idea how she can be more powerful than Thor given her back story. But whatever, why bother having a coherent plot in the days of JJ Abrams et al?
The story, a preachy one about various woke topics including immigration as well as the required feminist tropes, works about as well as a paper straw. For some reason it also seems like they wanted to showcase the LA transit system which, if anything , seems to have decayed since the time this was set... Anyway the plot is fairly incoherent and at the same time predictable - to achieve this is quite a feat. Larsen's portrayal of Danvers is insufferable which was always going to be the case, but she should have at least attempted to make the character somewhat likeable. Instead she succeeded in portraying a character to was patently unlikeable but for no reason did some things to save the world...",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","Let me start off by saying I like Brie Larson as a person. I think we'd be good friends and very supportive of each other and have some serious laugh attacks. I would definitely stick my neck out to have her avoid doing anything that would tarnish her rep as an actress, voila Captain Marvel. I love the MCU's 10 years of films (minus Thor Ragnarok the opening with a diff version of Thor from his previous 2 films was cringey) so I want to be very clear here this isn't coming from someone who should have a bias toward marvel films. Captain Marvel had it's moments of ""woah that's cool"" ""haha that's funny"" ""oh she's cool"" ""haha I like Brie Larson's attitude"" ""Girls rule!"" ""Wait are they getting political? Ah crap."" but I definitely wouldn't watch it again. It was definitely underwhelming to say the least and literally was a good filler film which is what I'm most positive DISNEY was going for seeing as ENDGAME releases the following month. This was definitely a cash grab film to get some last minute (female hipster non binary type feminist) fans before MCU's finale, END GAME. Will Captain Marvel be responsible for taking down THANOS and was JUST introduced in this film? I hope not. Don't avoid this film but definitely fight to not see the FORCED and non natural immigration agenda in it because that will ruin it for you.

The movie had elements from other orgin movies in it, like Thor's confusion on Earth, Iron Man's personality, and some other things. Captain Marvel is a story about Carol Danvers trying to find herself. It is an orgin story set in '95, therefore Nick Fury and Colson are very different people than they are today, I think Samuel L. Jackson and Clark Gregg did an excellent job in playing a younger, less experienced version of their characters.

","From all the hate it's been getting, I expected not much mote than an avarge if disposable MCU movie (and to be fair, I that would have fine with that), so while thr movie does have its flaws, I was pleseantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie.
It's biggest problem is that the main characer could've been better developed, as sometimes an emotional moment won't resonate as much as it should because there wasn't enough time dedicated to exploring how she feels about not knowing whi she is; but I could never call her a vad character.
The scructure of the movie, the supporting cast, and the action (even in its overly rapid MCU style of editing) were all great.
What I appreciated the most about this movie however, are the quieter moments; Carol reuniting with Maria and Monica, Carol and Fury talking and even many moments with Talos (one of the most interesting ""villains"" in the MCU) and others. I've heard many call this movie slow or boring, and while it certainly is slower than most other MCU movies, I felt it was for the better. It's not one of the MCU's best film, but it's far from being the disaster some would like you to believe. It's a fun romp that takes its time and handles moments that could've easily angered some people (and I imagined some were angered) gracefuly.

","This is one of those movies that is mildly irritating if you don't think about it. If you do think about it, it's insulting that this was an acceptable addition to the MCU. Ant-man and the Wasp, and Dr. Strange were much better than this. However those are placed in the same category, as this hunk of crap. Seriously, look online and watch any video of them breaking this movie down, it's obviously insultingly bad. That whole scene in the Winter Soldier with Nick Fury's eye, which was an intense scene, is turned into a joke! No one reacts to losing and eye, then says ""it's just a scratch"" lightheartedly. Plus Brie Larson is a standoffish nightmare. There are plenty of feminist actors in Hollywood that aren't such a pain.

There are DOZENS AND DOZENS of reviews set at 8, and all have the ""7 out of 8 found this review helpful."" Every. Single. One. It seems like they had people who work for the MCU, boost it's ratings, like they did on Rotten Tomatoes. All the reviews pretty much said the same thing too! Most mention ""haters"" ""trolls"" or ""negative reviews"" so it's obvious they are just there to boost the ratings. Almost all of them are an 8 too, and anyone that gave this an 8 or above, has an agenda. This movie is the worst origin story of ANY MCU movie. This wasn't just bland, it's infuriatingly bad. This movie would have been bad without the addition of Larson, but her lack of emotion from someone constantly called ""too emotional"" through the movie, was way out of place. Add that to the bad writing, many plot holes, and you get this stinker.

Sure, it's a somewhat amusing diversion, but I see why many fans feel it misses the mark.

With Captain Marvel, there were great special effects and action scenes which are now expected and redundant, but it's almost as if there was a checklist of current event cultural topics that had to be worked into the plot. And that excellence or greatness had to exist at the expense of others.
My daughter also thought the movie was OK but preferred WW, Alita and Aquaman as recent superhero movies.
Most frustrating was how calculated the cast appears to have been selected - calculated not to optimize story but rather other goals.

But a friend got free tickets and invited me so I went. Putting the political crap aside, it was a mediocre, if not decent movie. Nothing really new in the formula. The action was subpar. But it was fun seeing Nick Fury and how he lost his eye. The story is a bit convoluted, with a few inconsistencies with established canon and timelines. First and foremost, the Tesseract being with the aliens even though it was found with Captain America. It wasn't explained how it goes from Fury's desk (end credit scene) to being with Loki and his scepter in Avengers. But again, putting that aside, it was a bit better than I expected. There was a nice twist with the shape shifters actually being the good guys. But damn, Larson has no real facial acting abilities. And it is sad to see that for ""strong female characters"", they have the same generic cocky attitudes, demeaning any men characters they cross paths with. This one is hard to dismiss the politics and the feminist wave. At least with Wonder Woman, she showed emotions and real struggles of trying to find her way in life and her role in the universe. Here it just seems on the nose and the idea of ""oh, strong lady needs nobody, she's a strong bitch"". But maybe that's just my white male privelage, and I'm just a troll?

The script. Utterly ludicrous and completely full of holes, at times it even defeated it's own logic. Yes I know it's Marvel but this just did not join up and the whole 'cool 90's' vibe is just cringe worthy. The fact that the credits listed four or five script writers was a sure fire warning sign.
The direction. Was there any? Were the two listed directors just filming random pages out of the alleged script and then hoping it would all come together in the editing room? News flash; it didn't.
Now I like Brie Larson, she's done some good work but here we had a very one dimensional performance with zero range being exhibited. Maybe it was the script, maybe it was the lack of direction but this had all the hallmarks of ""hey, cool pay cheque, I'm in""
The rest of the cast do the best they can with poorly drawn and/or developed characters and some are just reprising their MCU role for the sake of the franchise, of them all Annette Benning does the best job.

","Okay, so I went to this movie (I'm a woman) with extremely low expectations just from all of the drama from this being touted as a feminist-male-bashing movie. I was pleasantly surprised! The movie had some super fun nostalgia (like the computer processing time! Lol), and it had some fun twists that were unexpected! I'm not a fan of Brie Larson, but she did a decent job! The main ""feminist"" points were more about the main character showing men (who told her she couldn't do different things because she was a girl) that she indeed was strong and powerful and that she could do things like they could. I didn't see any male-bashing, since Agent Coulson and Fury both were strong men who weren't bashed at all. This movie made me even more excited to see ""Endgame""!

","Yes. I said it. The Incredible Hulk is underrated while Captain Marvel is overrated. Why? Because Captain Marvel is the Mary Sue of the MCU. Think of her as Alice from the Resident Evil franchise (2002-2016) where she basically one-ups every established character and makes them look incompetent, including the Edward Norton Hulk himself (I wish the Abomination were around to challenge her). Plus, this movie basically reinvents a plot convenience of the ""Tessaract"", as if other movies in the MCU haven't done so already. What am I talking about? To quote The Joker: ""Whatever doesn't kill you, only makes you stranger"" (stronger, in this case). How? Shoot at the Tesseract (or whatever energy source powering an aircraft that looks like the Tesseract) and stand in its blast radius so that you transform into the most powerful superhero in the MCU. You might think this is third-grade graduation, but that is what happens.
This movie is Men In Black (1997): (Couch Tomato confirms this.) Samuel Jackson is Agent J and Clark Gregg is Agent K (not literally). But unlike that movie, this movie pretty much suffers from an overpowered anime fan fiction syndrome that turns the movie into a drivel not worth your money.

She had some one liners that were okay and some that were kind of corney. Some of the humor got a chuckle from me but not much more. Sam Jackson was fun, Coulson was barely in it but his part was fine. The yahoo moments were kind of meh and the finale was anti-climactic. Also, it seemed they intentionally went out of there way to emphasize her being a woman instead of her being a human. What is that about? And I don't know about you but if I found out that the team I'd been working with for 6 years, who we relied on to keep each other safe, was lying to me the whole time, there might be a little more emotional baggage there.

The action sequences are rote, at times almost muddled. Movie is just too forced. Not to mention feminist propaganda everywhere. No, not recommended, and I love Marvel movel, but this one just missed everything. A movie that feels cold, disappointing, and unworthy.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

While the plot is mediocre the whole movie experience is fun. I loves the chemistry between Carol & the young, energetic (and more fun) Fury. I know a rating of 9 is a bit too much, but I was smiling walking out of the theater after watching the movie.

","After all those moanings about the greatest hero, the greatest villan, the most important marvel movie - all what we got is very mediocre opening movie about a perfect Mary Sue that easily beats everyone right after start. So, basically it is an even more boring version of the most boring character of all times - Superman. Furthermore, movie doesn't give a single reason to emapthasize Marvel as a living person - movie just states that she is good and strong, her enemies are evil and bad, and by the way she is a woman, girls power and so on.
For sure, that movie doesn't deserve 1/10. Well, it deserves massive 10/10 neither. As extremely mediocre movie it should be somewhere around 4/10, but no one cares about the movie itself anymore, everybody just screams about political and social agendas of the filmmaker, lead actress and people who honestly didn't like what they have seen.

Shape-shifting is a ploy used by film makers that if, over used, can just be annoying, as in this movie. You think someone is having a conversation with a friend and suddenly that friend turns into an enemy, it seems a bit of a lazy feature to me by the scriptwriters. Apart from that, if you are not a Marvel obsessive, which I'm not, and just want to see a stand alone movie, it's a job to follow this confusion. Having said that, the special effects are dazzling, and the acting by Brie and Samuel L. Jackson is great fun as they spark off each other well. Brie is a superb actress and her light, throwaway lines really make you warm to her. Liking the main character is essential in any movie and she makes this work rather like Gal Gadot did in Wonder Woman.

They've ruin so much in one film with the MCU and now many aspects just don't make sense with the formation of the Avengers and why wasn't Marvel called in the attack on New York or at the start of Thanos's invasion, zero Sense.
Brie is ok, very flat, the one time you think Yeah go on, is at the start when she Roars while fighting, but you never see the emotion again.

","Gonna start this of by saying I am a cbm fan and after this was announced I was totally excited to see this character. I wasn't a huge fan of her comics, personally, as I felt they didn't go anywhere but I was excited for how they were going to fit her in. I was lucky enough to get an advanced screening with a mate who works at a local cinema so I had to see it. Unfortunately, it just didn't cut it for me. This is a personal opinion so don't take it as gospel but yeah, it was really lazy. The trailers didn't really excite me to be honest, they didn't look great. So when I sat down to see it I was willing to like it but I wasn't expecting much. The story was very bland and very uninspired. The action was very flashy and polished up but didn't have that level of excitement I'd feel in The Winter Solider or in the warehouse fight scene, they felt too blatantly choreographed and on a further note, the cgi was very bland, making those cg action scenes even worse for me. The cg was very akin to Black Panther or the Justice League reshoots. Or even worse, Ruffalo in the Hulkbuster suit. Very pretty but very plastic. Didn't work. I'm noticing a trend with MCU movies and bad cg recently, especially on Iron Man in IW and CW. Thanos was very well done but in here, nah. Brie Larson tried her best, I can tell, But it didn't work. She didn't feel like she belonged in the role at most parts, especially as a pilot. It felt forced and her delivery just wasn't on point. The practical effects were very boring, imo. Her costume felt like a suit from Legends of Tomorrow. Which are good costumes, but not for a few hundred million dollar movie that's part of a few billion dollar franchise. The skrulls looked very fake, very much like the Dragon Ball movie. Interior sets were very obviously sets. There seems like there was no effort at times, to be honest. The only really stand out part was the end credit scene. You'll have to see it for yourself but yeah it was good. Coulson looked dreadful and he was very forgettable even though I love Coulson and AoS. Fury looked good in most scenes but he didn't look like Sam Jackson in the 90s, he looked liked a 70 year old man trying to be 50 year old man, which is what he is. But for what was possible in that, they did a really good job. So yeah, all in all, story left a lot to be desired, acting was very poor, cgi was not at all good, effect on me in the long run is minimal and I'll pretty much forget about it in a few months. In the long run tho, I'm forever grateful that little girls and grown women have a great role model to grow up with and be inspired by like I had with Batman and Superman. Living in a world where we have Wonder Woman and Captain Marvel on our screens representing women for what they are, strong amazing people, is great. It's just a shame that this, as a movie, didn't work. But it makes my opinion invalid when i see my friends little sister smiling every time she sees her, so it's worth it.

I wonder that is why Avengers:Endgame release is kept next month giving less time to digest this movie and appreciate what coming in Endgame.
The character Captain Marvel was not developed properly and seems to rushed sometimes.

4937,14 April 2019,Tompa1234,10," My first review
","Well, the move is good for sure but it's definitely not flawless. I noticed some problems with pacing being a bit wonky at times. In the beginning everything was fine but later on, there were some parts where the flow of transitioning from one situation to another felt ""off"". Some things happened too fast which made those scenes not as convincing as they could have been. I've seen this in other movies too like Aquaman for example so I didn't make a big deal out of it but a flaw is still a flaw. I also didn't like how, for the most of the movie, Captain Marvel didn't fight at her full strength and just when she unlocks her full power we see a bit of fighting and then the movie ends. I guess they did that to pump you up for the upcoming Avengers Endgame but I still think this is the movie where we should have seen her fight in all of her glory and we didn't see much of that so that kinda disappointed me.
On the other hand, the film, of course, did many things right too. I seriously expected first half of the movie to be all about Captain Marvel's military life as a pilot, which would have been kinda boring but that's not what they did. They tried really hard to make things interesting. There was this sort of an intrigue that was spread out through the whole movie, off wanting to know who exactly she is, what was she doing before she got her powers and how did she get them in the first place. In Black Panther and Spiderman Homecoming there were some boring parts but not in this movie. I think that this is how these action movies, that are based on popular franchises like Marvel, should be. Non-stop action and fun without a single dull moment. The parts in this film that could have actually been boring were filled with humor to make up for it. The humor itself was very cute and fairly well done in general. I actually laughed out loud at some parts which is something I don't usually do. There is also a nice little plot twist in the movie to spice things up even more. And yes, the fight scenes and visuals were really good too. When she unleashed her full power I got chills and that final boss fight was really funny.
And now, on to the hate. There are these haters who have this negative fixation in their heads and they will do everything just to make it come true. It actually saddens me to see to what extent these people would go just to prove themselves. Yes I'm talking about low ratings on imdb for this movie. Giving the movie ""1"" and writing a negative review for it just to put people off from watching it. Trying to convince them that there are problems where there are none. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the lead actress. They say she is ""stoic"" or stiff and while there were parts where she kinda seemed that way I didn't really perceive it as stiff. She is like that because the character that she is playing is supposed to be that way. She is a cool, noble, brainwashed person from another planet who was taught to suppress her emotions. But maybe these people are implying that they think she it like that in real life. I don't know about that but if she is, that's exactly why she was such a perfect fit for that role which is kinda ironic, don't you think?
Some people also accused the movie of being too political for which I was told that it's because ""People from USA are very sensitive to politics in movies"". I can kinda understand that but I think that, even if you are from USA, you won't really be bothered because there weren't as many of them in the movie in the first place. There were only some parts where she stands up after being beaten down instead of giving up which is, I guess, alluding to her being a strong woman which is, once more, alluding to feminism but even those parts weren't as blatant and apparent as they could have been.
After the movie was over, I actually asked my friends what they think about the hate and they didn't even know what I was talking about, let alone taking it into consideration. That's tells you enough how much these haters actually affected things but I still think it's unfair how the movie got a low score on imdb just because of these haters. Yes the score is ok now but the first time I checked it was 6.9 and every review that I looked at was negative. I usually don't write reviews but this time I had to make an exception so that I can try to fix things and I'm glad I'm not the only one.
I've watched a lot of Marvel movies recently and I have to say that I would put this movie above Spiderman Homecoming and Black Panther but below Civil War for example. I enjoyed it about as much as Antman 2 actually so if you liked that one you will like this one too cause it's a similar blend of humor and action. As for the score, my actual rating would be ""8"" but this time I will have to rate it with a ""10"" to counterbalance all those ""1"" ratings. I'm actually fine with the score that the movie has now. 7.2-3-4 is an acceptable score in my opinion but anything lower than that is a big no.
And one more thing, I was actually aware of all the hate that the movie was getting before watching it, but I walked in the theater with an open mind, expecting a good movie and that is what I got. The movie wasn't perfect but it's definitely one of those movies where the good outweighs the bad. The likeable cast which charms its way into your heart, combined with nice humor, great action scenes and intriguing plot makes up for all of the movie's shortcomings. So I repeat, the lead actress is fine and the movie is good. Just ignore the haters and go watch it. You'll see you'll like it.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","Space-themed superhero action that's reminiscent of Guardians of the Galaxy, minus the wealth of charisma and the groovy, well-placed musical cues. Captain Marvel tries to carve its own little niche in that last respect, with a heavy load of popular '90s radio hits spewed all over the place, but they feel far less curated and personal. In a few important scenes, such heavy-handed soundtrack choices actually detract from the action, rather than enhancing it. The Captain herself, former test pilot Carol Danvers, is reserved and composed by design, a different cut from the brash Marvel template that takes inspiration from her military upbringing and fits her eventual role as a sort of galactic peace officer. This makes for a less colorful lead than we've been conditioned to expect from the mighty mega-franchise, and I can understand how that might rub a few fans the wrong way. Personally, I didn't have an issue so long as we were slowly unraveling the tangled threads of her origin story, but she'll need to find a richer supporting cast to thrive in future solo outings. Lighter fare than I was expecting, and rather small in scale despite the veiled implications of a long-running interstellar war. Its throwback setting places this film in a unique position to explore and enrich the stories of several MCU playthings - Fury, the Tesseract, Ronan, the Kree - but even with those little curiosities, the whole thing feels a tad unnecessary.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

Living with the Kree she is being groomed by Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) in an elite Starforce Military. When a mission takes an unexpected twist she finds herself working with two enemies, the Skrull and Humans. As the journey advances and Danvers grows she begins learning things about her past, things that lead her to realise that there is a lot more to her than she's being told by the Kree race that saved her.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

I was ready to compromise with a bland one-sided character but honestly you could really feel the passion radiating through different aspects of the heroine. The action was top notch and it was more than just sci-fi fist fights. The story was decent thanks to its unexpected turn of events. The soundtrack was amazingly fitting and did well in supporting the setting. The comedy was abundant but thankfully not as much as in Thor Ragnarok. Of course it wasn't all laughs, it did have its fair share of teary moments and inspirational ones too. It actually did really well inspiring its viewers, definitely one of its strong points. Definitely a must watch for MCU fans since it gives an interesting look into an important part of the overall story.

She basically had not obstacles. I think they're trying too hard with being woke and having Women leading characters and black characters. Unfortunately, black Panther sucked too. This movie didn't even explain why she's called Captain Marvel. And how is it that Fury and Carol's friend and friends daughter meet aliens and go to space like it's no big deal. Also, I didn't like the explanation of how Fury got his eye patch. From being scratched by a cat?! In a different movie Fury says ""The last time I trusted somebody I lost an eye.""

Not to spoil anything here but from the get go throughout it seems like the movie character was meaningless but the subtext was rich with feminism and racism. Not only does the movie progress with a quick pace till half way but then it runs down till our grand finale of epic CGI.
While I am a major fan of the Marvel series of Comics and Movies, this was a contrived piece of garbage that showed majority of males as sexist jerks.(All being white males.) As if all she ever received from a male influence was abuse or betrayal. Wow. Thanks for that, not all of us are total douches.Other than Samuel Jackson's performance and character the movie was flat. Sam was fun and entertaining as a younger Fury and was definitely the real scene-stealer.
The fact is that through out this movie I felt like I was being sold some propoganda about the nature of feminism and racism. Like all whites males are ass-hats of sexist and moronic behaviors. (Coulson being a singular exception (he was already established as the good guy)).
While I do not mind seeing a woman leading movie, in fact I loved Wonder Woman. This was a contrived trash of feminism and trash that makes people think that women are oppressed and that White men are sexist or/and racist. Shame on Marvel Studios for this trash.

I was lost when her daughter told her she rather her go on a mission that had a high percentage of her never coming back instead of staying with her. Another lesson of strong female power, so basically they went overboard on that theme. I truly think this movie could have been put out after end game but they did it now so I watched it and it was not bad but wasn't great it was average. I think Brie Larsen wasn't able to deliver the believability that she is CM like GG did for Wonder Woman.

She is feminist, taken from our time and sent back 20 years, no wonder she is so disoriented.
Had minimal expectation for the score, the 90's were definitely not my cup of tea, but even by those standards I was disappointed.
This movie could have highlighted the moral struggle of Mar-vell, his mentorship of a human caught in an extreme situation and the sacrifices both make (especially with Marvel reacquiring the X-Men franchise and maybe introducing the Rogue/Captain Marvel arc) and this was replaced with a woman with memory loss, thinking and doing what she thinks is best because of powers she was granted.

","This is by far the most mediocre of all Marvel films, and I LIKED Thor: The Dark World. Brie Larson is dull and never really developed into an actual human being. I attribute this to three factors, the tired and played out amnesia trope, the dull and unimaginative writing, and finally the actress herself who really seems to lack much range or ability. I cannot for the life of me imagine how she finagled an Academy Award. I never became invested in her character, she never made me care about the movie.
I was thoroughly unimpressed with the CGI in this movie, coming off of Alita: Battle Angel last weekend, which was a masterpiece of CGI, the effects in Captain Marvel were strictly amateur hour. It's obvious that Marvel studios was unwilling to commit the budget necessary to really make this film look good. The fight scenes were foggy and hard to follow, every moment of action just screamed ""low budget"" compared to the rest of Marvel's lineup.
They were obviously hoping that the cat and Samuel L. Jackson, would provide the acting chops necessary to carry the film but I was not convinced by his role this time. They camped it up really badly and instead of a stoic, capable, and serious commander, we got a cat crazy jokester. Coupled with the terrible job of De-aging him with CGI I just could not enjoy his performance.

The Action is visually appealing, yet tensionless, also sometimes it is hard to keep track of what is happening during a fight. The SciFi-parts of the film work very well with great costume design, make up and CGI.

","First of all, Brie Larson as Captain Marvel is good. In a few scenes, it looked like she was giving it her all in that performance while in others it seemed as if she was only phoning it in. That can be said about a few of the others. Especially Jude Law, who plays Yon-Rog, who I've seen in other roles and is captivating in it. But this role just didn't seem to fit him that well. Really the only person I can say did a good job was Ben Mendelsohn, who plays Talos. Every scene that he's in he gives it his all and you can easily tell he is comfortable in this role. This has nothing to do with the movie but I just loved Goose the cat. But speaking of Goose when they used a real cat actor it was great but when they switched it out and made him CGI it looked terrible. I feel like they blew their entire budget on different scenes and had to just find a clichéd cat on the internet. I only say this because all of the scenery in every scene is amazing. The cinematography is outstanding in this film. The pacing in this film was weird and just off. The film is two hours and four minutes but it feels like two hours and forty minutes. One thing that bugged me but also I was happy about was all the answers we got for other Marvel movies. This film has plot twists but they are so obvious that even a kid could figure them out before they are revealed. Due to this film taking place in 1995 I feel bad for all the kids who won't understand the references the movie is making. But the cultured ones like me will get them. Finally, there are two end credits scenes but really just stay for the first one. In the end, Captain Marvel isn't the worst Marvel movie but it also isn't the best.

5081,9 March 2019,Gpanther67,5," Actaully a disapointment
","For those thirsty for a new hero in the Marvel Universe we finally get our first female solo hero movie, a landmark many have waited for, but is the anticipation answered with a film that the Marvel banner can truly feel proud of? Oscar winner Brie Larson takes on the role of Carol Danvers, better known in the hearts of comic hero fans as Captain Marvel. She is supported by a strong cast and has the top-notch production value we have come to expect from a Marvel/Disney production, but mixed in is some disappointing elements that made me walk out of the theater feeling more disappointed than marvelous.
Normally its here that I speak a little about the plot tying to give you a sense of what the film is about without revealing big shocks & surprises, but I find myself unable to even being able to give any hints because the story is so convoluted with flashbacks and plot twists, even from the start of the film. Anna Boden & Ryan Fleck decide to jump right in, feet first into the film without much subtext or background which caused me to begin the film in a dazed and confused state. I wasn't sure if I had missed important details or if my questions were too early to ask. Much of the riddles are answered in rather disappointing reveals and when I say disappointing, I mostly mean in a comic book fan sort of way. Its obvious that the filmmakers of today for Marvel pretty much want to scrap everything we were told in the 70's and 80's and just accept that this is a new day in these characters ways. The mythos of many of the backgrounds of these characters have been drastically altered to surprise us old fans in a way that may be too much to understand or enjoy. But putting that criticism aside there are some other flaws with the film.
Surprisingly for me, one of the biggest problems is Larson herself. She is certainly a talented and gifted actress who has a natural screen presence but her charisma and humor are a little off in this film. She didn't strike me as funny, nor was I captivated by her as a hero. The humor complaint is actually a constant for this film. It simply wasn't as funny as your average Marvel film and the jokes either come off as flat or canned to me. Even the often-reliable Samuel L. Jackson never hits his usual stride in this movie. I will say the cat is as advertised but even that joke gets a little stale quick. The most disappointing cast member for me has to be Annette Bening who just comes off as completely out of sorts in this movie.
What I really found to be a problem is the obvious social commentaries throughout the film. As much as they were disguised in the subtext of a galactic superhero film, they were pretty obvious and did more to make the story a disaster than make honorable notions about bravery and loyalty. The #1 element I find in bad hero movies is the lack of a good villain and sadly this film has a villain problem.
I have often wondered if Marvel could make a disappointing film and with ""Captain Marvel"" I got my answer, a resounding yes. The best thing I can say about the film is the Stan Lee tribute that opens the film. A touching tribute that starts a very disappointing movie.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

One thing I like about movies if done right is when they leave you with questions, but it has to be done well.

","What can I say about this decent or so-so Marvel movie? A surprisingly (I wouldn't say a good performance but kinda energetic) okay performance from Brie Larson, where if you have seen the trailers, she looks kinda dull and you are instantly worried that she wouldn't be able to carry the movie. While her performance is allrite, both Sam Jackson and Ben Mendelsohn, gave a great supporting performance with both Nick Fury and Talos, supporting Captain Marvel in her journey. Her frequent interaction with Fury and their instant chemistry, makes this movie come alive for me and for once a Ben Mendelsohn performance that is not the same as you have seen him before, ever since he broke into Hollywood and playing the same bad guy again and again. His performance as Talos, the kinda leader of Skrulls, an alien race who is involved in a war with the Krees, which Captain Marvel herself is a part of its Starforce, was surprisingly touching and for a moment there I was kinda sorry for their race and wanted him and his race to live. Not to mention Lashana Lynch's performance as Maria Rombeau, Captain Marvel's best friend, who is also good with her constant energy, almost on the same level as Brie, is of course entertaining and her daughter Monica, played by Akira Akbar is also a worthy mention. Speaking about Fury again, the CGI that was utilised to de-age him and Clark Gregg, who portrays the fan-favourite Coulson is flawless as hell, where their first appearances does make you feel a bit unbelievable but as the movie progresses you get absorb into their performance (There's not enough Coulson btw and it is more of a small appearance but they still did good on his face except for that one I think intentional error) and you don't mind the CGI after awhile. Positives aside, there are several flaws with this movie. Firstly, the action sequences. Despite the good CGI used in most of its set pieces, the fight sequences in the movie are bad. Speaking about making cheap fight sequences, this movie had plenty. No doubt Brie Larson and other actors trained so hard for their role, the way the filmmakes shot and edited the fight sequences are terrible. Secondly, the musical score. The first MCU movie composed by a female should be a good thing rite? Well I find the score pretty much underwhelming with several themes barely move you at all as an audience. Compared to other musical scores in the MCU, whereby they are not memorable but at least when you watch the movie you wanna shake your head or at least the music moves you. Here waiting for the Post-credits sequence feels so dull and uneventful. Lastly, the direction. Directed by both Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, the filmmaking duo behind critically acclaimed Half Nelson and Mississippi Grind, should be making a great Marvel movie just like Taika Waititi and James Gunn did, where they moved from an Indie background to making blockbusters. But instead this movie feels very dull and the 90's period feels very off, in this case it doesn't feel like the 90's at all. A constant reminder that this movie is set in the 90's with songs and nostalgia is constantly throughout the movie but if not for that, this movie should or definitely set in the present. Some of the shots are unmemorable and speaking about the action, clearly the duo have no experience in shooting action and as opposed to the aforementioned duo of Gunn and Waititi, despite having no background in action whatsoever, they did good there. Overall, depsite some negativities and positivities, Captain Marvel is an allrite movie and knowing Marvel's track record, this is a step down from what they used to do and here's hoping that the Russo Brothers will improve Captain Marvel's image or character in Endgame.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","Considering this movie is about alien warfare erupting on earth in the 90s, It is surprising how seriously it takes itself. Yes, our protagonist engages in witty banter with friends and enemies alike, but this is not Guardians of the Galaxy or Ant Man...there are comedic moments, yes, but nobody will mistake it for a comedy. This movie cares deeply about its characters - even the aliens, even the supporting cast. Honestly, that was refreshing. It is almost like Marvel turned time back to an era when action movies could be about finding ourselves, discovering our power, and sacrificing for others. The down side of that is this story feels a little cliche and predictable at points. (We have seen it before, after all.) The upside? It never gets too serious or too sappy or too sarcastic, and those are traps many comics movies have fallen into in recent years. There's a good balance here. It wasn't my favorite MCU movie, but it was solid nonetheless.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","I definitely think that bias plays a role in how this film is perceived. Bias towards the character, and bias towards the actress. I find the introduction of this character to be poor timing. A little earlier in the timeline, or a little later would have sat much better with me. I feel as if it is a slap in the face to the other heroes for Nick Fury to call in Captain Marvel as ""the"" last resort as he is getting snapped away in Infinity War. To have this film take place between Infinity War and Endgame and to promote her as the most powerful hero the MCU has seen, feels like it takes away from the 10 years of story telling and 20 or so movies that came before it. Brie Larson also gets her fair share of hate from critics. I don't think she does terrible, but she does have a distinct monotone way about speaking and a flat affect that is reminiscent of Kristen Stewart in the Twilight films or Hayden Christensen in the Star Wars prequels.

I was a little bit mad about the overall story but I will get to that in a sec.

the story is another ordinary story that we have seen in a lot of other movies which can sometimes be just fine but here it wasn't good because of the lack of logic, I mean Carol didnt know how to fly and also she couldnt breath without her helmet in space but then suddenly close to the end of the movie she can fly and at the end we also see her without her helmet.

However if you've seen Wonder Woman your aware that both outcomes are possible simultaneously. Throughout Captain Marvel continuously falls short of expectation. IMO they tried to combine the personalities of Tony Stark and Thor into one. How could this go wrong? If you took Stark and removed all his wit and guile, your left with a jerk who insults everyone. Thats the problem this character is so out of character for the actress that all these sarcastic jokes fell flat. I saw this in cinema and I will tell you all her jokes bombed. To be fair there was a cat joke that everyone in the theater seemed to enjoy. Ok im ranting, last thing. In every movie the hero falls and must find there feet once again. Usually this involves a clever solution or a brilliant plan no one foresaw and you think ""wow that was impressive really quick thinking"" This film has none of that. Every time she is in peril she miraculously gets stronger and smashes everything. I really dont like this message.

","This is a beautifully crafted movie. Stan Lee and the rest of the crew did a spectacular job filming. I see some bad reviews of this movie, most of them unreasonable. But I can accept outward opinions. Brie Larson, who stars as Captain Marvel, did a wonderful job of filming. It was also very unexpected, having twists and turns here and there. There are kid-friendly jokes that will make even the older of the crowd laugh out loud. Even I couldn't trust the alien species at first, wondering if they were trustworthy or not. It's a very touching movie, if you think about it. When she and her best friend reunited, I almost cried. Was it just me? Alright, then. But enough of that. Captain Marvel is such a good role model for girls, and everyone else. As you can see, it's not saying that Captain Marvel is perfect and can do everything. She has to gain control of it. Without control, she would be useless, with or without her powers both.

Here we have another blatant attempt by Marvel to make Captain Marvel happen, but falls face first due to a lackluster story, two dimensional villains, and poor acting on Larson's part. I feel really sorry for Elizabeth Olsen, Scarlet Witch was dumbed down in strength for the big screen and it's clear she has been sidelined by Marvel for Captain Marvel to swoop in and save the day.

Also I came out not knowing who Captain Marvel actually is, the character seems a cipher, not a flesh and bone woman like Wonder Woman who I could identify with, it's not that she's unlikeable per se, more the writers have been too busy pushing an agenda that the woman is lost.
The writing itself is terribly confused I see there were six writers, too many generals - what was the point they were trying to make with CM? Scarlett Johanssen's Black Widow does with one arched eyebrow than CM does with an entire movie. And Larson is a fine actress, the plot and writing let her down.

DCEU 'Shazam!' won more fanfare. So, what happen here? Without spoiling it too much, well for starters, the movie didn't get their story straight. Captain Marvel AKA Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) fighting Earth invading shapeshifters aliens Skrulls in the 1990s was supposed to be amazing. Everybody was really looking forward to a Secret Invasion type storyline. Sadly, we didn't get that as the writers didn't really wanted to redo the big shocking twist from 2014 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' with most of the world's biggest organizations being infiltrated and compromised by a sinister secretly outside source. Instead, they chose to subverted expectations by having that villainous group as refugees trying to find their families and hide away from the eyes of Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) & his unseen ruler Supreme Intelligence. I wouldn't mind it too much if the filmmakers also switch the roles for the Kree. I really dislike watching disordered flashbacks waiting for Carol to catch up to their clearly obvious predictable scheme. Honestly, the filmmakers should had gone with mutants like Mystique posing as aliens in order to play both sides into conquering the planet and placing her as the puppet leader. It would had been a good idea how to introduce some of the X-Men characters into the MCU. After all, everybody wants to see Danvers's big showdown with Rogue in the future. Nevertheless, seeing how none of the more sinister Skrulls were mention or used in the film's story. The aliens could play a bigger factor in future installments in a more faithful role to the source material. As for the revelation of Annette Bening's onscreen character. I kinda dig her character dual role as friend and foe. The same with Yon-Rogg (Jude Law). Shame that Ronan wasn't given the same crisis of conscience development with Carole. They hardly share any screen time. So, in the end seeing Carole fight him was not really that interesting. Nevertheless, I didn't really dig the spoon-fed subplot of the Kree repetitive telling Danvers to control her abilities and keep her emotions in check even if it's a metaphor of outdated gender stereotypes. Not only was the message heavy handed on the nose and over preachy. The montage of her getting up is really cheesy. To add onto that, that subplot also limited Brie Larson's acting chops quite a bit. Scenes where she is supposed to seem angry, sad or charming is delivered in such a robotic way that it comes off as phoning it in. It's not a good direction especially when Larson in other roles could act brilliantly complex. It's already bad enough that the character is indifferent with Goose due to Brie's allergies toward cats. It's also sad that Danvers doesn't even admire Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch) enough for the Supreme Intelligence to take that form. The emotional scenes with Maria were delivered so dully. Honestly if it wasn't for the great buddy cop chemistry that she has with Samuel L. Jackson's character Nick Fury to bounce off to. Carole would had been so very unlikeable and boring vandalizing private property shrew. Still, it was a bit odd to see Fury arrived at Pancho Bar before Danvers. He really must had done unrealistic quick detective work to pull that off. Regardless as for Jackson's acting. It's great. It's still surreal to see a more chill Fury around rather than the no nonsense older version. Nevertheless, the silly manner how the character lost his eye in this, really does hurt the powerful message that Fury told in 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier'. It's also weird that the attacker is able to roam free around two top-secret military bases after that and before. As for the de-aging computer effects for Fury. It was decent. However, Clark Gregg's young facial feature effects for Agent Coulsen looks awkwardly plastic. Meanwhile the CGI morphing animations for the Skrulls blend so seamlessly with the practical make up effects with Ben Mendelsohn's witty character Talos being a highlight. Sadly, the action scenes of the movie are not that impressive to look at. Having outer space fights in pitch darkness is not a good idea. The limited visuals are quite bland compare to the other Marvel cosmic movies. Then there is the earthly train foot chase. Cliches as hell. None of the battles on planet quite wow me. Actions scene like the jet dog fight only left me with jarring plot-holes such as why did Lawson even bother building a lightspeed engine if the Tesseract can create wormholes? This movie seemed somewhat shoved awkwardly in the MCU continuity and it shows. Hopefully the sequel could explain some big burning questions like Carol or Goose wasn't around during the events portray in 2012's movie 'The Avengers' and why Ronan went after the power stone rather than Danvers in 2014's 'Guardian of the Galaxy'. Also did the Asgardians and Xandarians go to war with Hala after the events of this movie. A lot of things need to be explained. Hopefully the sequel would also solve Danvers all over the place overpower issues. Being adapted from several plot elements from multiple one-shot comics that used the Captain Marvel title over the years including bits of Author Roy Thomas's 1971 ""Kree-Skrull War"" can cause that. Overall: While this movie has a badass 90s soundtrack full of some of that era greatest hits even if some the songs dark lyrics don't really fit the narrative and a wonderful, but confusing Stan Lee meta cameo/memoriam. Watching this movie gave me jet lag. In the end, it's not quite worth it.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","This is it. We're finally here, after weeks of backlash towards Brie Larson, after weeks of anticipation, weeks of wondering whether this movie will be good or bad, it's here. Is the movie bad? No. Is the movie good? Absolutely not. This is a very mediocre movie in the sense of its characters, story and the world in itself. Brie's portrayal of Captain Marvel is very bland, there are moments of hope where I thought she was becoming interesting but that hope is rendered false quickly. At no point does the movie make me feel sorry for her or love her and that's an immediate problem. Fortunately, the movie also has other characters, most noteably a young Nick Fury. Samuel L Jackson is great as usual but I have to mention this, the de-aging was done exceptionally well. The CGi didn't even look like CGi, it just blended and it looked perfect. Seeing Nick Fury here was different to what we're used to, he's more cheerful, fun and trusting of others. In that sense, it's a completely different portrayal and Samuel L Jackson does a great job. Jude Law did the best with what he was given. The character was written poorly with no real surprise to his story. Other characters in the movie kind of just fell into the background where they either became irrelevant or they never had enough attention for me to notice them too much.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","So the movie, if you haven't watched any other Marvel Movie, EVER, and you take it as a one off movie is fine, 6/10. But (Ned Stark reference) considering the Universe it is in, I can honestly say it's the worst one.
There is nothing really exciting to see, also it literally destroys the entire MCU, if something should be retcon is this.
I have had issues with the characters of Vision (who for all intents and purposes should have been a god, as he is literally powered by an infinity stone and is a freaking AI) and Scarlet Witch (who draws her power also from an infinity stone but is not powered by one, also her brother is powered by an infinity stone but he is less powerful then her - MCU).
Somehow the godlike entity Vision is the damsel in distress at all times and Scarlet Witch is always there to help him out of the though situations.
Now take this and crank it up a few notches and you get ""Captain Marvel"".
The acting is between ok and ... well you can put any other actor in there and you will get the same thing (referring to the main characters both good and bad).
I can't really thing of a worse MCU film, save your money, I'm not getting mine back. Hopefully Avengers End Game will save the day, but (Ned Stark reference).",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","SPOILERS AHEAD...
Actually one of the best of the MCU I think.
Having us go on the learning journey with Carol as she learnt about her past, so did we, I think that was a nice change to the normal origin story formula displayed in the other marvel films. It meant we didnt have to wait a whole movie for her abilities to come into play. And made for a fast paced film. Seeing a younger nick Fury was hilarious especially as he had no idea what an alien was until this film. It added to him especially knowing what he is like now (well before he was dusted) and then seeing a time when he wasnt the nick fury we knew and love. I think even though it was set in the 90s it tied into Avengers Endgame perfectly too. Carol taking possession of a pager really gets you excited if you stuck around for the Inifnity War Post credit scene. And if you stuck around for this one then endgame hype truly becomes real. If I had any problem atall it was fury losing hes eye the way he did. I actually found it hilarious on it's own, but putting it with knowledge of hes line in captain America the winter soldier ""last time I trusted somebody, I lost an eye"" it really makes it seem less badass. So much to say but overall a great addition to MCU and I think it's up there with my handful of favourite MCU films.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","The latest MCU entry gives Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel her own feature (right before being drummed into the Avengers ranks in next month's End Game to do battle) so now audiences will get to see who this woman is & what exactly she'll bring to the Thanos party. Anyway, Marvel, known as Vers, is part of a Kree elite fighting unit holding the Skrull (a shape shifting malevolent race which I first remembered from the 60's Fantastic Four cartoon) at bay as they police the galaxy but due to a mishap when her team attempts to retrieve a spy from a desolate planet, Vers is captured & tortured by the Skrull to gain knowledge of a light speed engine who's creator (played by Annette Bening) died in protecting its location back on Earth. Vers escapes her captors, reaches Earth but soon, due to the after effects of her time spent w/the Skrulls, starts to doubt her existence as evidence shows she's from this planet & not a Kree as she was led to believe. Incorporating de-aging makeup again, we get a younger Nick Fury (& Coulson as well) teaming up w/the lost 'proud warrior' to right things before the truth overwhelms all involved. Handily written & directed by Anna Boden & Ryan Fleck (Sugar/Half Nelson), this film has to do mucho heavy lifting, bridging 2 important sequels, introducing a new character & being a female empowerment manifesto which it does successfully in spurts & starts but being most audiences just want to get this Cliff Notes version of the character & her background out of the way for the main course to come, no one's going to come away so distraught that they'll swear off Marvel forever.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","For a MCU movie on which many people were placing such high hopes on, I cannot help but to be disappointed.

It's got some nice ideas floating around and the participation of a de-aged Samuel L. Jackson as a young Nick Fury, is always a joy to watch. The same cannot be said about a waxy-faced looking Clark Gregg as rookie Agent Caulson. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
The film seems to exist merely as an excuse to be a two-hour Easter egg of all past and upcoming MCU movies and although the movie, as all MCU movies, is mostly very competent on a technical level, it lacks pace, takes a long time to get going and only really starts to pick up on the last 15 min o so.
But, above all, my real gripe with the movie is the performance of Brie Larson as the main character, in one of the most uninspired performances of an actress in the MCU; made all the more disappointing as this being the first female-driven movie of the franchise, the whole thing was relying heavily on a good performance and coming from such a well regarded actress, it's very disappointing.

With all it's flaws they at least tried to show how he became more mature and stronger with life experiences, but with Captain Marvel, no way, she is the strongest on the first day because she is a woman, only bound by her own limitation compounded by the world she was in (Kree) who were keeping her at bay, otherwise she's the strongest just because she has the XX set of chromosomes.

","Going into this movie, I was open to whatever the film was going to offer. The reviews online didn't have an effect on me because it was very biased. After seeing the movie myself, I can say that this is a fun movie but not one that would rank high in the MCU. Brie Larson does a good job with what she's given and leaves me wanting more which we'll get in Endgame. Samuel L. Jackson gives my favorite performance of his in the MCU. Fury in this movie is more relatable and inexperienced which allows us the viewers to see growth throughout the movie. Ben Mendelsohn and Jude Law are also great in their roles. Mendelsohn's performance is able to solidify Talos as another great villain. The action scenes are fine but there's a lot left to be desired. They feel very plain and have no style or intensity. However, seeing Captain Marvel in her true glory was amazing and it leaves you believing that she could definitely help the Avengers. The story is also fine in that it's nothing groundbreaking but watchable. I feel this movie does its best when it's cracking jokes and being a buddy cop movie with Fury and Danvers. The references to the future of the MCU were also nice as it gives longtime fans something back after the countless hours they've spent in this universe. Overall, Captain Marvel is a good time at the movies and deserves at least a watch for yourself.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","Ok so in my opinion... We needed more captain marvel origin stories for this to be exceptional it felt too rushed and forced and i kinda felt like they wanted to fill the holes and the waiting for the end game easier for fans XD i agree with ppl saying that they've built so many characters the past 10 years then Suddenly this superhero comes out powerful than anyone else... marvel just wanted to make a female superhero to inspire us (I'm a girl) but they couldn't do enough
Overall
I did enjoyed it although some scenes were boring but it was pretty decent and the acting and visual effects were good too

I think marvel could've made this one after the endgame where they are gonna probably introduce new superheros(if they still intend to do that)

5342,11 March 2019,Reelnerd,7," A Marvel to behold
","Captain Marvel Review
By Nelson Nantanapiul
I enjoyed the latest installment from the MCU starring Brie Larson as the titular Captain Marvel. I really liked Brie Larson's performance as a Kree warrior engaged in a war against the Skrulls a race of shape shifting aliens. Vers (Larson) ends up on earth after a botched mission to infiltrate a Skrulls stronghold and embarks on a journey to piece together her past and to stop the Skrulls form getting their hands on tech that could give them the upper hand in the war.
Marvel felt very much like a phase one film and that's not a knock on this movie in any way. This film was a lot of fun, it had the Marvel brand of humor that works so well and a great heroine in Vers/Carol Danvers (Larson). Her chemistry with a younger as of yet unjaded Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson) was really great. It was really great to see Nick Fury back on the big screen after being absent from the franchise for so long barring his quick end credit cameo at the end of Infinity War.
Ben Mendelsohn was so good as the ""big bad"" (Talos) in this film the head of the Skrulls. I am a big fan of his work and he delivers with a heartfelt and multilayered performance. There is a nice twist in this film involving his character that I won't spoil here. I did not see this reveal coming and it's what in part made this installment in the franchise so enjoyable for me. That being said without trying to reveal too much there is another ""villain"" in the film that was very cookie cutter and which has become the hallmark of many an MCU film with exceptions of course (Loki, Red Skull, Killmonger).
Clark Gregg returns as agent Coulson in this film and there was really no reason for him to be in it as his character contributed nothing to this film other than to serve as a nostalgic easter egg for the hardcore MCU fans. Ronan (Lee Pace) from the first Guardians of the Galaxy also makes an appearance but he also was not essential to the plot and was not needed in the film other than to help tie this film into the larger universe but that was the purpose of the Fury character who WAS an essential part of the story.
There are other nods and references to the MCU some clever some not so much. The explanation behind how Fury lost his eye is addressed in this film and it was the most ridiculous and anti climactic scene in the movie. It felt like a scene out of Hot Tub Time Machine except in that story someone loses an arm.
I would have liked it if they had spent more time in highlighting how the war between the Skrulls and the Kree began and why the villain of the piece acted in the manner that he did. Due to the absence of this plot point the motivations of the some of the characters in the film didn't feel as impactful and hard hitting as they potentially could have been.
Captain Marvel did its job in introducing us to a new power player in the MCU who will undoubtedly play a major role in the upcoming Avengers: Endgame. I enjoyed this film quite a lot despite its flaws so definitely check it out. I am eager to see where they take the character in future MCU installments. As always make sure you stick around for the end credits.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

Turns out, no, I just have standarts and depths of perception. Rewatched X-men the other day completely sober and boy, comics movies can be good it turns out.

captain marvel is more of the same. great cast and special effects but the movie was not worth it. boring scenario bla...bla...bla......u get tired. that was more a comedy than a real sci-fi film. we got to the point that we most LAUGH with the marvel movies than to get serious with.
captain marvel is not a bad movie. IT'S BORING. have it's moments here and there but is not overall worth it.
maybe it's great for little kids. i'm not a kid.
maybe the problem is that we get too much of these stuff these days.
for me I would prefer to watch a supergirl movie rather than it's clone marvel is.
we already have supergirl. why we need another blond superhero girl ?
until when those movies will make a billion dollars each so that they will bombard us with the SAME AND THE SAME STUFF ALL THE TIME ?
This movie for me is a C+ and I recommend it for the fans to watch it ONCE and that's that.
watch it and judge for yourself.

With movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe they always make everything connect with a line, a person or cutscene. They have done it with every single movie in the MCU and it felt like Captain Marvel was just put in last minute considering the only reference was in the very end of Avengers: Infinity War. The lines she has makes me cringe, The story seemed off and it's not logical that she's never even been remotely mentioned in Age Of Ultron or Avengers or anything like that. After rewatching it i'll admit it wasn't that bad. Her lines weren't as cringe as I remember, I definitely found it easier to pay attention (as the first time I watched it I almost fell asleep in the theater) and it just was way more enjoyable.

There really weren't any characters in the movie that were interesting... Nick Fury was the only character worth paying attention to while all other orbiting characters were cardboard and lacked depth.

","With these few word in title, you can easily explain all problems with a ""Captain Marvel"". Carol Denvers\Vers\Captain Marvel is obviously the strongest protagonist ever, in MCU. Thor? Iron Man? No way! From the beginning and till the end of picture we see how strong Denvers are.
I really do not understand why would we need 3 hours long Avengers:Endgame if Carol can beat Thanos all alone in 3 minutes? MCU made Brie Larson character so strong that often it is way too boring to see how she fight against bad guys. Screenwriters has made her too much powerful. Speaking of screenwriters \ directors: Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, these are the ones who responsible for movie result. Yes, I am sure rating was ""corrected"" by trolls. But lets be honest, it is possible worse standalone MCU movie ever made! Because it was failed with its first and most important mission - to bring strong female Marvel character on the big screen! Movie doesn't spend enough time to show Carol Denvers Earth life before 'incident'. From second minute on screen until the last scenes, Denvers all the time a strong, self-confident and some time haughty person. She doesn't faces many walls on her way in order to reach her goal, she doesn't evolve on screen as character (in psychological way), except her costume and super powers. Character didn't explored even at 50 %. Stanislavsky would said :""I don't believe"". There few positive moments in the movie are: Ben Mendelsohn, Samuel L Jackson and the Cat. Oh yes, and Marvel intro logo in this time was just an amazing. I do believe Marvel should do this for Endgame also.
In nowadays audience wants to see strong female characters on big screen, and me as well not exception. But in order to that, studios shouldn't do copy+paste tries, from some early 80-s movies with bad-ass lady, who kicks everyone butt. Hell no! You need to make your character more human. Human who was fall down, but who will rise, stand up and continue fight. Human who failed many times, but still find powers to reach her\his goal. This is only way!

We can vilify this movie about character writing but it is not just Carol Danvers. Nick Fury is weird, Yon-Rogg is not so intense, Talos is not the main villain, Ronan's part is just a cameo, story becomes disorganised on relationships of these characters...

","So I was rather disappointed by this movie, I think it may be the worst thing Marvel has put out in years. It might very well be making its money right now but that doesn't make it a good movie by any means. It's just another one of those throwaway flicks you can watch once and then be happy to never watch again. It's so obvious that it's been rushed out just to get her into the MCU in time for Endgame and it shows in practically every aspect, they don't spend enough time developing either her or the story and the damn thing only becomes really fun in the last twenty minutes and that's just the truth of it, it's really not that good of a movie. I think part of the problem for me personally is that I'm very much invested in the story and characters of the Avengers and then along comes this character out of nowhere that I know virtually nothing about and I'm meant to root for and care about her? Uh I don't think so, because Brie Larson was a walking brick, she wasn't even likeable, the Skrull leader came off as more approachable and human than she did! She was without a doubt the least interesting thing about her own movie and her arc wasn't even really the main focus, I never got a real grasp on who she was meant to be as a character, she was just too cold and stoic for me to connect to or care about, it was like that lame female Terminator from T3 had gotten a starring role! I don't care what award Larson has won because she sure stunk up the joint as far as this movie goes! She was too untouchable, she just constantly plowed through everything, there was never a moment when she was beaten down and had to make her way back up and she was never truly vulnerable. And when she got all of her power back at the end and became a frickin flying fireball who was packing enough firepower to demolish a gigantic starship and a barrage of deadly missiles all by herself...what are you supposed to do with that exactly? Even the Hulk lost a tooth once! She was the very definition of overpowered.. I wanted to love the movie and her, but I just wasn't having any fun and I could not for the life of me get into it, it felt like a movie that was just going through the motions to me, the only real thing that made it okay was that it looked good. And it was certainly no woman power movie, it was too sloppily made and plain dumb to be that movie. Wonder Woman, was that movie, and it didn't have to beat you over the head with its more feminist elements in order for you to get them! Ladies, you can do better! The only character I really enjoyed was the Ben Mendelsohn one, he made a real character even through all that nifty makeup and I didn't see the twist with him and his people coming, that was a neat surprise. And the Nick Fury thing I didn't have a problem with, how he was acting differently or the de-aging special effect because it was looking pretty flawless to me, but Jackson's trademark banter did to me feel really off to the point that his scenes with her felt very forced and awkward, they had no chemistry at all. And there was too much emphasis on the silly cat, the little guy was cute but he was a bit too Men In Black for me once he got the Cthulhu maw going! So for me just not particularly fun or all that worthwhile overall, I was so disappointed. She feels very much out of place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and I for one don't care to see very much more of her in the future.. A basic superhero movie that left me cold, generic and nothing special.

I felt most of them were bland. Specially the hero. She needed a scene where we actually built empathy with her. I only started caring for her when Nick Fury's life was also in danger. For me, the worst part of the script is the third act. It felt too long, involving at least 4 different fights, instead of one that successfully tied in the whole story. In my opinion, this happens because the script is too busy trying to set-up stuff for the sequels (like Ronan's appearance that impacts in no way to the plot). These scenes should've been left for the after-credits, instead of the flat scenes we got there. It's a good movie, but I don't think it has enough elements to be considered a classic in the Marvel Universe.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

I liked Brie Larson on the movie. Most people didn't, but I can't understand why.
And I liked how the movie was some sort of origins story for the whole avengers stuff, mainly Fury.
These are the only 2 major positives in the movie. Everything else is just... not good enough for a Marvel movie.
The story feels lame, the action is underwhelming, most of the (now characteristic) humour is not funny at all, and the main reason I disliked the movie: The character is just overpowered. It's like Superman with no weakness, which made the last fight scene seem like she's playing a video game in very easy mode.
I think I get it, producers want her to be a character that can defeat Thanos or something like that, and made her really strong. But damn... 2 minutes after finding the potential of her powers and she's already kicking everyone's ass?

","It takes a little while for 'Captain Marvel (2019)' to come into its own but, once it does, it's certainly enjoyable. It sets itself up to be somewhat generic, broadly speaking, so that it can pull a superb subversion later on. This 'twist', for lack of a better term, is rather unexpected, which is partially due to the casting of certain key players and the track record that the genre (as well as cinema as a whole, actually) has with such things. It's an invigorating, societally relevant plot-point that shakes things up and adds an appreciated dosage of subtext, too. It's not the only reason why the piece is ultimately as successful as it is, though. Another key aspect is the inclusion of one (scarily good CG) Samuel L. Jackson, whose chemistry with the equally good Brie Larson is what really makes the movie work. Their interactions are what keep things feeling light and energetic - though, that's not to imply that the narrative fails to deliver its darker, or more serious, moments. It's actually quite resonant in a number of key places, which is partially because the affair doesn't feel as though it's taking itself too seriously - it's not dour, that's for sure. Ben Mendelsohn takes a tricky role and does wonders with it, making sure that the humour doesn't undercut the emotion so much as make it seem more realistic. The actual plot focuses quite a bit on investigation, as the central character tries to untangle the mess of maybe messed-with memories inside her head. The whole thing is quite compelling, with the answers slowly being revealed to both us and the character at the same time. This is another aspect that feels fairly unique, especially among the slate of 'origin stories' within the 'MCU'. Some of the revelations are slightly obvious - though, maybe just to those familiar with the tropes associated with this type of story - but this isn't a big deal because most things are encompassed by the larger, more subversive 'reveal', which is harder to see coming, and because it's undeniably satisfying when everything is eventually on the table. I guess the most macro, or obvious, theme is that of empowering determination, a 'get back up' mentality that prevents others from dictating what one can and cannot do. The third act, which sees this theme come full circle in the name of compassion, is fun and fulfilling, despite being driven by a now somewhat overpowered (near indestructible) 'superhero'. Ultimately, the picture is entertaining and, even, somewhat unexpected. It easily sits somewhere if the better half of the 'MCU', pulling off a decently original 'origin story' around ten years after they, essentially, stopped being required. It also has one of, if not, the best (now sadly posthumous) Stan Lee cameos in the business. Obviously, it's not perfect but it's still a real marvel. 7/10",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","Where to even begin. I have LOVED the marvel series and what they have done.... Yes even winter soldier. This movie however was just not good i'm sorry to say. I just can not tell you what we where supposed to connect with. What was the conflict? How did Nick furry know where Carol was going on the motorcycle?? Why didn't the Skrulls explain to Carol what was going on when they had her on the ship? Where did those other agents go in the records room?? How did one scroll give Carol such a hard time on a train when not 5 minutes earlier she could knock out 20 of them with her hands bound and blow up a whole large ship? Why did that whole Skrull ship blow up from having one small hole in its hull?? WHY DID THE KREE MAKE IT SO YOU CAN CHANGE THE COLOR OF YOUR UNIFORM ONLY TO GET UPSET AND BERATE A SOLDIER WHEN THEY DO??? Makes absolutely no sense. Brie Larson may be a talented actor in other things but in this she is wooden, lifeless, and just flat out cringe in this movie. I could not rename a single Kree villain in this movie if you held a gun to my head. Not one. They are generic rag dolls thrown in Carol's way to give her something else to do beside frown and imitate wood. There are positive thing in this movie. The cgi de aging was amazing. If you like cats this movie delivers. That brings me to another point, the cat was more likable and watchable than the main character! Wait for it to come out on Netflix or Hulu then decide for yourself. Save your money and time and skip this in the theater.

","It will be forgettable in the end. My biggest flaw with this movie is how Fury lost his eye...Not the best MCU film, I would of love to see her past more fleshed out. The movie didn't have anything that pulls your emotions ..no love connection, no tragedy etc. Tbh I didn't even know they used CGI to make them look young. I really didn't feel an emotional attachment to Carol or her story. It was just a bland movie where a lot of stuff could be cut out. Captain marvels character is very forced and her in endgame I don't like her She was portrayed to be the "" over power"" but she was hardly in the movie. And when she was it like meh (except when she saved Tony) She has no chemistry with any of the cast in the films. It was so so with plot holes that don't add up. One of the biggest ones? Fury coming to know that their are powerful entities in the universe during Captain Marvel. It's one of those movies where if I don't watch it again in a few years, The daughter also just seems to accept it as if she just got back from a vacation, not as if someone they thought was dead came back. I really hated how it was handled. Captain marvel should have been played by a different actor in my opinion this movie was not a good fit for her. A movie is supposed to make the audience connect with the main character and, for me, this movie does not do that, I had absolutely no clue what was going on in this movie. The plot was so confusing. Captain Marvel did a good job on being a boring and very annoying character in the MCU! Why was she able to absorb the core power?

5510,6 June 2019,CabbageCustard,6," So so superhero flick
","Considering the importance of the Captain Marvel character and her story to the Marvel cinematic universe, her first foray onto film is average and no more. Sadly this movie, in which Earth finds itself in the middle of an intergalactic war between the Kree and the Skrull, lacks excitement and tension. Rather than being invested in the action and the outcome, I found myself being pretty blase about it all. I know it's just a movie, but shouldn't the audience care about what is happening? Perhaps part of the reason is that so much action is spent on other planets, rather than here on good old Mother Earth. Still, Guardians of the Galaxy didn't spend a lot of time on Earth and it was a very exciting movie. Another part of the reason may be that the characters are just not engaging. I don't recall seeing any of Brie Larsson's other work, but I do know after this that she makes a pretty bland superhero. Compare this portrayal with Gal Gadot in the role of DC's Wonder Woman. Now there is a woman who is charismatic, inspiring and who looks like she could really kick some ass. Brie Larsson's Captain Marvel looks like she could host a ladies' coffee morning. When she turns up in the end sequence, ready to take part in Avengers - Endgame, instead of feeling a frisson of excitement and anticipation I felt let down. (What!? You again!!??) It was a teaser that didn't tease. Some of the other characters are puzzling too. Samuel Jackson is good but Jude Law is as uninteresting in his role as the title character is. Annette Benning is silly as the 'Supreme Intelligence' (or whatever she's called). Ben Mendelsohn, an actor I like, plays his role with a peculiar London type accent that seems really out of place on an alien from another galaxy. It's quite off putting and makes it hard to take his character seriously.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

5513,8 March 2019,mhorg2018,5," Here's an honest review without all the fanboy hatred.
","Captain Marvel is one of the reasons I really hate fanboys. Late last night I signed on to IMDB.com and started reading reviews - 99 percent of which were full of hate and misogyny, an emotion that reigns among too many fans in the comic book world. Women characters are fine, until they become major characters - as back up's, sidekicks and romantic interests, they are fine - but let them take center stage and the hate comes oozing out. Now, I'll admit, I know little about this variant of Captain Marvel. My own interaction with CM was when the character was a man, Mar-Vell of the Kree (nice move with Annette Benning, especially the little homage where her hair went from blonde while she was on earth, to white when on Kree - a reversal of the first Captain Marvel, who, when he gained cosmic power, went from White to Blonde). So I went in open minded. I'll also admit surprise that the Skrulls - always bad guys when I was reading comic (and an original Fantastic Four villain at that!) were lightened up a bit. But reading other's reviews, I'm amazed at the utter hate, and wondering - what the hell movie did those pinheads see? It wasn't the one I sat through. Captain Marvel is a fun movie, with a great cast. I wish they would have gone for a little more character building for Carol Danvers - but her back story does get told and Brie Larson did a good job of playing the role. All this she can't emote garbage - well, haters are going to hate. I can do without their lame comments. Fans should remember that they support the characters - they don't own them (something Star Trek fans have never learned. If a franchise had to depend only on the diehard fans - well no franchise would exist today at all). So here's a little breakdown of Captain Marvel for those with open minds.
The Great: A beautiful opening homage to Stan Lee. Really touching and well thought out. I hope Avengers: Endgame opens the same way.
The good: The cast, the story, the action, the 90's. Harkening to Guardians with it's 70's and 80's tunes, this part of the soundtrack is great. I was especially surprised to hear a gone (I'm only Happy when it Rains) by Garbage, one of my favorite bands. Annette Benning and Ben Mendelsohn, as well as Jude Law give stellar performances. Those by the actresses playing Maria Rambeau (Lashanna Lynch, who I can HARDLY wait to see in Y, based on Y the Last Man!), and her daughter Monica (who will also bear the mantle of a Captain Marvel), played by Akira Akbar (This is Us) were great as well. The movie flows really quickly, barely giving the audience time to breath. They straightened out Captain Marvel (Carol Danvers was original Ms. Marvel in the 70's, with a much more revealing costume - but I'll be honest - that was a poorly written comic).
The Bad: As with most Marvel Movies, the music (not the songs, but the original music) is forgettable. They could have cut down some of the cute cat moments, there's enough of that on the internet. Other than that, not too many complaints.
My final comment is: What the hell is a flukken? Whatever this alien creature is (I won't say who) I hope I never meet one on a dark night. And for the comically inept - that's a joke.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

They are fools, and filmgoers desperate for anything that makes them actually feel something ignore the doomsayers and often propel such movies to box-office glory.

","Soon as I visit this page & Twitter, etc. all I see are complaints. I have been a MCU fan since the first Iron Man and I enjoyed the approach to this movie. For me, the marketing/trailers were underwhelming in comparison to the film, because I really enjoyed Brie's portrayal of Carol Danvers, the Skrulls were fantastic and Samuel L. Jackson (in my humble opinion) outperformed the entire cast. It was fantastic getting this different side to Fury. It's a great family film, with the 90s nostalgia being a character as well. I would have liked some greater stakes, however you know what's coming and the film is a fantastic set up for Endgame. That post credits scene is the cherry on top! And Mr. Goose!! I'd love to see a Goose & Groot team up one day! Again I am not sure if this review will make it past the unfair backlash (which is very fishy to me), because based off of seeing so much of it, I was prepared to hate it. This movie gives me a feel of Phase One in terms of introduction vs. 2018's Black Panther introduction which was also progressive but delivered in a more impactful way, for me. This movie also read as a big Air Force/Armed Forces advertisement and that's great to see as well. Again, to wrap this in a pretty little bow, good film, nowhere near as bad as they are making it out to be. The marketing, trailers should have been better. I certainly hope Brie CRUSHES it in Endgame even though her spunky disposition might be a bit jarring to receive at first.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

The story was weak, and under developed. The flip flopping of the aliens from bad guys to good was silly.

","Review:
After reading a lot of negative comments about this film, I was expecting it to be awful, but I actually enjoyed it. I did find the storyline a bit sketchy, and extremely far-fetched, but as I haven't read the comics, I don't know how accurate the concept was. I enjoyed the banter between Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), but it amazed me how he wasn't shocked about Captain Marvel's powers and the whole ""outer space"" experience. Like most of the Marvel movies, the visual effects were on point, and the humour in the script made me giggle in parts. The various characters all brought something fresh to the film, like Talos (Ben Mendelsohn) and Yon-Rogg (Jude Law), but I'm used to seeing Law play the goodie and Ben playing the baddie. Goose, the cat, was also a great addition to the cast, along with Maria (Lashana Lynch), who was Carol's best friend, so I'm surprised that there were so many people disappointed with the film. Don't get me wrong, it doesn't touch Infinity War or Ragnarok, but it isn't the worst film in the MCU series. Brie Larson was a decent choice for the film, and after watching the bonus material, she did push herself to the limit, to make her role seem realistic. Samuel L. Jackson actually showed the humorous side of Nick Fury, compared to the secretive commander in the previous movies, so it was good to see why he is the way he is now. Captain Marvel does put the Avengers to shame, in terms of her powers, so I find it puzzling that she hasn't popped up before. Anyway, I found the movie entertaining, but it feels like it came a bit late, in terms of the Avengers storyline. I don't know what is planned for the future for Marvel, but I hope that they involve Captain Marvel because she has a lot to offer. Enjoyable!",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

When she go to Rambau's house the history got a good plot twist with a bad execution, because we don't care about the Cree or the Skrulls, it don't look like a War, and they are so DUMB.

","I would actually give this a 7.5 but unfortunately that isn't possible, so 7 it is because I think 8 is a little too generous.
Anyway, I don't quite understand all the hate? Is this because of the backlash towards Brie Larson? If so, that's not fair. You're supposed to be reviewing a movie, not a person. That being said, I didn't really like her in this role, maybe it was just the writing? She came across as far too arrogant and not in the fun Tony Stark way. I like that she has confidence in her own ability but it just went a bit over the top sometimes. They probably pushed the feminist agenda a bit too far but I'm not gonna say anymore than that, whatever, make men feel guilty lol.
Anyway, not the negative stuff is out of the way, let's get to the positives. I had a huge amount of fun. Some lovely comedy and spine tingling action! I liked the way it tied into the rest of the MCU, it certainly grabbed my interest. There's a nice little twist too which was delightfully unexpected. Can't fault any other performances. Pretty decent score with some nice throwback 90s songs, was good to hear some Nirvana. Definitely some of the best CGI in the MCU, Carol herself looked stunning in her ""final form"" . Absolutely stick around for the mid credits scene, the post credits scene is the usual silly gag so that's not necessary at all.

","Firstly the best thing is it finally unveils the Skrull and Skree empires which are like in lots of Marvel comics. In the movie lots of people move around or talk like mannequins, but ACTUALLY I admire the naturalism in a way. It also has the switcheroo part of who you think are the good side are really bad and the bad side really good, gasp! So those are the antagonists. There's some shoehorned-in rickety peeling back the layers stuff to add this is a serious movie not a computerized cartoon, showing Cap Marvels' origin as a salt of the earth type adrenaline junky, racing go-karts, and doing crazy military rope swinging around, rad! But mostly it's when they reconnect with some friend in some rickety country home, and it's peeling back the layers stuff brrrrr. They should entirely excise this part on the cutting room floor with extreme prejudice, the nadir of the movie. I like the cosmic stuff with Jude Law and his Blue Man Group for sure, and Sam Jackson actually has the most to do with Nick Fury than in any other movies, with a more resigned air lighthearted and he's probably thinking about the sandwich he eats, he just wants the sandwich and it's basically a reflection fo where his character is at this point in these movies. Everyone in this movie talks in super casual mode, just like the good guys and the bad guys. ""Mumumumm"" ""Oh, mumumum."" Captain Marvel quips something in a semi-cynic tone. Even in the trailers for the upcoming Spiderman movie they finally unveil a smidge of super villain Mysterio played by great actor Jake Gyllenhall and he says something like people talk in a Library, something paraphrased like you don't know what you're up against or you're not going to win against me, the dullness of a sputtering fart. Anyway I think it's just the filmmakers themselves perspective with all of this, the crazy shapeshifting Skrulls even wear cute cuddly human sweaters or jackets at some point, it could be domestic sentiments of the filmmakers or just them in a refined classy ware to show the audience hey they're not too diff just like you and me, for the current audience+cinema, even cosmic stuff needs a sweater.

5585,8 March 2019,brentage5000,7," I LOVED this, just not as much as I wanted to.
","Let's get this out of the way first -- this film is good and non-preachy. All of the internet panic about it being a vehicle for feminism and Brie Larson being a horrible actress and the wrong choice and politically motivated was, of course, crap. The dogfights are cool, the effects on Fury and Coulson (who's barely there) are fantastic, and the movie offers an interesting if predictable twist on the first movie origin story (let's face it, if you've seen a trailer, you can guess with a reasonable accuracy how the plot will fall out). Where the film falters, though, is its villains and references. Without getting too spoilery, there's a few previously seen characters who could have been replaced in this by a random new character and nothing would have changed. There's also an appearance of something that I'm pretty sure is already in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody when this takes place (1995), so its appearance here, while impactful, may have a brief timeline hiccup. Also also, the name Fury gives the report he's typing at the end and what it references is just a little too much of a gimme. Of all the ways to come up with the needed name, that had to be one of the dumbest and most infuriating. Overall, the movie harkened back to the good old days of phase one, before the movies got so bogged down with connectivity and could just stand apart. That's not a bad thing, exactly, it just seems to be holding the character from going as high and as far and as fast as she really deserves to. Regardless, the movie is still good and worth checking out, both for putting it in the saga appropriately and for that super-cute, super-awesome kitty.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

5588,8 March 2019,erril,3," Bad movie, but had a great potential and could be improved upon going forward
","First, this is a review of the movie itself. I know there has been discussion outside regarding cast comments, and sincerely, I just went into the movie and forgot about those things, as what matters for me is the film itself, and its own merits. I am a big fan of the comics and the MCU, and so although I wasn't familiar with this character, I was looking forward to her introduction and understanding how this will impact the MCU. I also know that having a very overpowering character, like Superman, is harder to relate to, so I went into the movie already willing to give them some slack, but hoping they could pull it off and make an awesome movie.
Unfortunately, for many reasons, the movie is simply bad. And yet, it had many things in it that show it could have been much better, so maybe there is hope for a sequel in the future, and are definitely things that can be changed. Let me explain. I think the easiest way to describe how I felt during the movie was that I cringed a lot.
First, I had heard that the main Actress Brie Larson was a really good actress. I can't comment on that as this is the only movie I saw with her, and I definitely want to see other of her works now so I can get a better opinion. But in this movie, her character was portrayed in a very abnoxious manner in most of the film (you know when a person can't be nice or kind to anyone, but just wants to act like a know-it-all jerk?). I don't know whose decision this was, maybe she was asked to portray it this way. There are though some better moments, in particular in the ship with Fury, and with her best friend's child, that she is more likable. I just wish we had seen more of that. I think the tone for her came off unnecessarily cold and again, the way I felt was that it was just being abnoxious. Now, I think this is something that she and they can change going forward, but it did not help when they are introducing us to a new character. This is even worse taking into consideration that they really need audiences to like her, given how difficult it is to connect with such an overpowered character, as is Captain Marvel's case. So, her acting was way off, and I don't know why, and I don't want to put in question her capacity, hence my wanting to see other works from her.
Anyway, moving on. The second most impactful problem is the production and editing. The movie is a long string of moments that should be of either emotion or great action, but that fall flat. I really feel they wanted those moments to be really grand and epic, and I think they actually could have been, but they just felt rushed and unearned, which actually turned them into really cringy.
And this is the problem for me, I think that Captain Marvel's story was actually all there, there were lots of good pieces, which were presented, but the way they brought this together, the timing and presentation was beautiful visually, but was just rushed and felt really off for me, personally. So I really feel that it wasn't a lack of compelling story or character motivation, just the way the final cut flows. Those emotional moments, and the action, they were lacking either some more development, or not to be rushed or so obvious.
The Skrulls (and Ben Mendelsohn) were great, it was always nice to have Fury and Coulson (I'm a big fan of the Agents of Shield, Coulson is such a charismatic character).
Ok, having been unbiased about the movie, I do need to address honestly the Feminism question. I am a person who really enjoys that there are movie with strong female leads, with great stories to tell. And I think Marvel has a lot of potential they still have not taken advantage in terms of female characters to tell more stories about (I mean, Scarlet Witch and Black Widow have been great until now, and I would love to hear more of their stories, and have them lead their own films, i think they deserve more attention. And the actresses have done great!).
I know that some of the directors and cast were open about the feminism part. I have no problem with that. I just feel that it was cringy to force Director Fury to act dumb in some situations, just to give Captain Marvel an air of ""gotcha"", hey, let me lead you. That is just not necessary. I think audiences deserve much better. I loved Alita, which had a great female character and was an awesome movie. In this movie, I felt they always had to prove that Captain Marvel was better than the men around her, and sincerely, it was cringy.
The movie is bad, because Brie Larson's acting is bad, and the production was way off.
But, I think those are two things that they can turn around I and sincerely hope they do, and if they do, I will enjoy watching what they do in a sequel.
Ah, did I mention I loved what they did with the Skrulls? Well done on that point! And yes, that cat it is cool!",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

Total rubbish. She is from Earth. She has close friends. Why let them die. Also she is way to powerful and so dominates the action. Anyway back to the movie. The story was actually ok, Larsson was fine as the hero and Law surprisingly good as the baddie. The Skrulls were good but hated their cockney type voices and other than shapeshifting were not that powerful. My understanding is that if they assume an identify so if fighting her why not be the hulk, Thor or CM herself rather than an FBI agent. Made no sense. I really hated the Fury bits.

","There is no question that Brie Larson packs the gear to serve in the army of Marvel super-heroes. 'Captain Marvel' is the twenty-first movie released since Iron Man (2008) and the first with a female lead. That's a lot to hang on the shoulders of a young actress, even an academy award winning one. But hang it they do. In fact, if it wasn't for Larson's performance this movie has little to offer. A lack luster script, formulaic origin story and dull supporting cast, means that Larson is left with a lot of the heavy lifting (and, seemingly, without a hair stylist either). That's balls out for any actress! In the comic books, Captain Marvel is a secondary character, which means that , like Ant-Man and The Guardian movies, there was a lot of wiggle room to create a movie with a broader appeal unrestricted by the canon that comes with the more iconic heroes. Yet, there is nothing new here and Larson is largely left to win us over with her steely glances, barefoot fighting and playful kibitzing. Fanboys or grrls will not be disappointed but 'Captain Marvel' doesn't hold rank to attract a wider audience.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","Good
* it at least attempted to have its own identity
* the blockbuster portion was creative to show its 1990s Earth
* the location was one not used before in a marvel film (L.A.)
* the concept of the story was interesting, (not so much the execution)
* some funny moments
*a few practical effects looked good
* if you care about the marvel lore, this helps some, although it isn't necessary you can just look up what happens and it has the same effect
Bad
* everything that it does was already done better by another marvel movie (humor (guardians of the galaxy) , visuals (guardians) acting (most of the other ones), character development (iron man), the fish out of water concept (Thor), cgi (guardians))
* every aspect was painfully average and serviceable (cinematography, editing, writing, music, one exception was acting)
* it's not that Brie Larson wasn't the Actress for this role, it's just that she was likely poorly directed, she never really emoted, she was mostly just stone faced, which was ironic because her whole character was about dealing with emotion
* absolutely nothing was memorable
* there was a whole sequence in the climax that was full on copying a Star Wars space battle, sound design, music, pacing, the effects
* the jokes often did not flow well with the plot, the whole movie had to slow down and stop to say a joke (think of a jj abrams film where the joke is said, and it's related to the situation, then immediately the action continues, so it doesn't ruin the pacing)
* captain marvel was barely an interesting character, she had the bare minimum to make us care about her, with little emotion or relatability to her, this is partly due to the stone faced performance and poor writing
* bad villain
* the huge budget should have shown more, mostly lols like it went into cgi that looks bad",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

I wanted to like this film because I like strong female characters and a change from the normal stories we have had for decades from movies and TV. With all that taken into mind, this film suffers from several things, like lack of a decent villain, after all a hero is only as good as the villain they go against and this villain ranks among my bottom picks for MCU villains we have had so far. I think given what she has to work with, Brie Larson does a good job, especially with her scenes alongside Samuel L Jackson's Nick Fury.

","Wow. I am so surprised. Captain Marvel is a complete contrast to every single review I read before going and watching it. While it is flawed (in some parts badly) it is nothing compared to the negative f.ckathon of reviews on the internet- I'm telling you: it's not that bad.
From reading those I went into this with incredibly low expectations. I was expecting Larson to be basically an emotionless brick wall for the entirety of her solo film, and while she didn't exactly have the most character, neither did Doctor Strange in his solo film, neither did Black Panther (*Oscar nominee*).
I need to get one thing out of the way: the twist converting the Skrulls from the basic comic book movie villains into empathisable victims blew my mind- this is a gamble for Marvel, their well-known cosmic Orcs are now the good guys? That was singlehandedly the best decision by any member of the production. Yes I had a feeling Jude Law was going to end up being a villain; but not like that. I must say Talos (Ben Mendhelson's Skrull) is a little goofy at times, but come on, it's a Marvel movie: it works. Yes, I was disappointed by how they handled Nick Fury losing his eye (they could have easily made Skrull Coulson get it out in the car chase at the beginning I mean how good would that be?) but look it doesn't particularly bother me. Lashana Lynch as Maria Rambeau was hands down the best character in the whole thing, and it was refreshing to see a woman actually doing all the bashing around, not just karate but actually shooting lasers from her hands like other tent pole characters.
The first part in space isn't actually that boring: I was expecting sorta Man of Steel prologue crap again but it's literally just space Lord of the Rings. When we get to earth it's even better.
Captain Marvel is worth watching- this one's better than half of the other Marvel films (yes 50% snap) and is a solid beginning for a new, female led (but not over-the-top feminism) franchise carried by an actress finding her feet in a new genre.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","The film takes its time to build, but the payoff is spectacular. A bit of a departure from a typical origin story as we follow Danvers' identity crisis. Identity struggle is mirrored in the ambiguity over who the real villain and even in the figure of ""Goose"". Danvers has an Elsa moment where she claims her true self in a sequence that is a moving climax. Up until that point, she plays the role of soldier, principled and loyal to a code even with flaws. She starts as Captain America and then starts looking more like Spider-Man as she learns more about who she is. The pacing is very much on the indie fill. context where Boden and Fleck are most comfortable. The fusion of that grounded intimacy and the backdrop of a cosmic war is uneven at times, but works. It's very much on par with the pacing of the Winter Soldier which might be hard for people who don't know anything about Captain Marvel. The complexity of the villains is refreshing since mid-way through we don't know who it really is. We have to discover who Danvers is and who the enemies are with her and the audience is never ahead of the story. Everything that might bother someone else about the story and pacing is exactly why I find this MCU installment refreshing and compelling.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

That is like the first Superman comic where he had nothing but perfection. It was so boring seeing her destroy everything that was even a bit of a threat because there was absolutely no sense of danger at all after the first hour of the movie. I don't get why they have to do this to a marvel hero, many female characters have flaws and yet they are brave regardless, this one doesn't have a misstep of adversity, she just got all the right thoughts out of the bat, didn't learn from anything, just a version of god except one that cares about silly human things. The movie had a great hour though, that is why it is rated at 5, I thought they are gonna make a believable hero, but I guess she is not allowed to have any flaws or weaknesses, which is pretty pointless, might as well make her destroy Thanos immediately and become supreme leader of the universe while she is at it.

","First up, I'm gonna promise to keep the politics out of this review. Any 9s or 10s you read are false as are the 1s and 2s. Forget the identity politics that came along with this film.
As an ""introduction movie"" into the MCU it ticks all the usual boxes. The effects are what you'd expect, the storyline is exactly what you'd expect and you can second guess the dialogue a mile away. It takes no chances at all. It's light stuff, as Ragnarok was, but that's what is needed with the upcoming, emotion charged Avengers: Endgame just around the corner.
It serves its purpose of introducing Carol Danvers to the MCU, it tries to have some fun along the way. It does have an underlying agenda, but it's nowhere near as overt as you would be led to believe. Samuel L. Jackson is the absolute stand out, Clark Gregg has little to do and the less said about the cat the better. Larson herself? She's fine. Just fine. Her dialogue is mostly bad but that's no fault of hers. She does seem a bit miscast but with a better plot and writing probably could've made a better fist of it.
I'll be honest, it's better than I thought it would be. It's certainly better than Aquaman, which I thought was terrible (and I am a massive DC fan, yes, you can like both!). It's better than Thor: The Dark World. And way better than Gaurdians of the Galaxy 2.

When a vital mission goes awry, a junior member of Starforce who continually struggles to keep her emotions in check finds herself stranded on Earth in the 1990s. Trying to be the best version of herself in preparation for a major intergalactic conflict between the Kree and the Skrulls, she's also deeply troubled by recurring dreams of her past life. The rudimentary storyline isn't compelling enough to make this soar, and the continuous use of flashbacks makes for an uneven narrative, but the film still benefits from some sensational visual effects, thrilling action scenes, a welcomed sense of humor, and good chemistry between lead actors Larson and Jackson.

There are some interesting ideas & visually inventive set pieces but after so many previous films already set in the exact same universe, it hardly does anything to set it apart from the rest & Brie Larson wastes the character's potential with her monotonous, lifeless delivery of every single line she's given - deflating any clear opportunities there were for any moving, emotional moments & thus, Carol Danvers is devoid of any noticeable charisma & my investment in her story was lacking to say the least, despite the filmmaker's desperate attempts to make the stakes as personal as possible, regardless of how grand & spectacular they became.

It may not have been amazing, but it was good to see to understand who Captain Marvel was and what is to be anticipated in the whole Marvel story. I know people like to talk about how it wasn't great, but if you look at it through it as a ""whole story"" perspective, it can make more sense. The movie itself I thought was pretty good. It was a good and interesting tale of how Captain Marvel came to be, although action and battle scenes were fewer than most Marvel movies. I thought Brie Larson did a good job in character and she's a great face for Captain Marvel. The best analogy I can make is simply this: imagine the whole Marvel story/series as a show; each movie being a different episode. As everyone knows in a show, some episodes might be more boring than others, but it still contributes to the overall story. Same with this movie. This movie might have not been the best ""episode"", but I thought it still contributed to the story in a good way. Now, some people might have just watched the movie for the movie itself, which is OK.

","""Captain Marvel"" sails in with a 6/10 rating, and it wasn't a bad addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Brie Larson's performance as Carol Danvers is strong, portraying a determined and empowered superhero. The film's editing keeps the story engaging, transitioning seamlessly between the present and past, although it occasionally feels a bit formulaic. The film's strength lies in its message of empowerment, emphasizing the importance of self-discovery and breaking free from imposed limitations. On the downside, the film's villain, played by Jude Law, lacks the depth and presence seen in other MCU antagonists. The soundtrack, featuring '90s hits, provides a nostalgic backdrop to the action. While ""Captain Marvel"" may not be among Marvel's top-tier films, it's a decent entry that adds a powerful female superhero to the roster.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

First of all this a comic book movie, it's an interesting genre, but it's not Dostoevsky, Tolstoy or even Dickens. Character development is minimal, it's all about visuals and they're very good here.

","Captain Marvel brings the standard MCU origin story solid visuals, action, and straightforward character arc but subverts some expectations in fresh ways. The technical elements of sound, action, and visuals are all very good and give a baseline of enjoyability throughout. Brie Larson is just as good as one would expect and hope - the script could've given her more depth and dimensions early on, but she does a great job with what she's given and brings energy and intensity with occasional humor that fits perfectly. I loved the plot developments with the Kree and Skrull, in forcing us to rethink our initial biases towards a group and instinctively seeing the group we associate with as better or more moral. Neither side is propped up as perfect or horrible, and their cultures are given depth that adds considerably to the themes of the film. The de-aging technology is remarkable, and Samuel L Jackson is pleasant as always in a fittingly lighter performance as this is before the stressful actions to come. Some of the closing themes felt a bit on the nose and rote, in how being human is an advantage because you pick yourself up and so on. I also found the explanation for the powers the core gave her to be completely lacking. First, as an ordinary person how could she absorb all that power and be fine? Also, how does it give her the powers it does - how could that energy transfusion make her fly freely, for example? The final action scenes felt absurd and exaggerated as she was unstoppable and had innumerable abilities. The explanations leading up to that (especially with the Kree installing a chip that both suppresses her core power and gives her their powers, which in conjunction with their memory wipe leads her to accept them) were spot on and satisfying. It's a really strong origin movie led by smart plot developments, a strong lead performance from Larson, and good peripherals. I'd say it's my #4 MCU movie, after Black Panther, Infinity War, and Winter Soldier and just ahead of Guardians and Civil War. Long live Goose!",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

There were a lot of diversion from canon which is one of the reasons for the film to be disliked to this extent, of course Marvel has changed a lot of canons throughout the MCU films for tha sake of the united universe, but changing Captain Marvel's canon was neglecting the freedom axquired by setting the film in 90's before the main events of the MCU.

","Ok so my final and first review of captain marvel. Knowing all the things this film has been going through I am IGNORING THE THINGS SUROUNDING IT AND JUDGING IT OFF THE FILM ALONE. So, with that being said, It's a film that has a solid script to work with, some solid acting, a solid direction with some new approaches, and some traditional mcu humor in it all together. Everything all around is just solid, and I think that's why people aren't liking it so much. Solid isn't enough these days for people and that's ok, but there's only so much you should expect for a film like this. Carol Danvers, her character is a mixed bag, for me, she didn't really get my attention until near the end, there's some forced agendas spreaded throughout the film and it can be distracting. The movie manages to make things work, Nick fury and Carol WORKS, Carol and her troubled past WORKS, side characters WORKS. There's plenty that works but it doesn't distract the things that either don't work or go completely off the rails. Like the forced plot twist with the typical ""MCU IRON MAN 3 MANDARIN STANDARD PLOT TWIST."" You'll know it when you see it... some plot twists you can literally see coming from a mile away and it's because the fact that it was already seen from her past. It's a film that poorly executes her past as a reason to forward the plot. A film can work with this method if executed correctly, for instance the BOURNE films have done this but you learn about the character and what's going on as the movie goes on. But this film you see forced dialogue and repeated scenes you've seen multiple times so you can know her THEN they add a twist that is DONE with in seconds. It's a twist that doesn't even feel like a twist it feels like a way of helping wrap the film up quickly, and once it does the film is practically over and done with in a bow. Carol Danvers learns nothing as a character other than her past but she DOESNT DEVELOP. Everyone else but her develops any knowledge from the plot. The villain twist was dumb. And JUST when you think it was going to be interesting when RONAN the accuser shows to be the villain. The film for me felt flat because of this and poorly executed decisions that I can ramble about all day. I can see why people hate it and why people like it. I fall in line more with liking it though. It wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst or even close to other abominations that come out in the superhero genre. It's just a over-and-done-with kind of film. Nothing amazing nothing terrible. I would give this film a 6.5/10 ONLY GIVING IT A 7 TO ROUND IT TO A 7 BECAUE OF MY OVERAL RANKINGS BELOW MAKES SENSE",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

I wont go into the depths of autopsy and the smallest intricate details of this movie trying to explain why it was bad. I will start with: ""I lost interest to this movie one hour into it."" I don't know how they producers manage to make such an uninteresting movie. My question to them or real professionals is, do you ruin the movie when instead of the history and exciting characters you try to make it about the IDEA, about something so important that you need to tell the audience so badly? There is something very deep and on subconscious level that made me fall in love with so many movies before. I know that millions of fans fell in love with the Marvel's heroes after the infinity war. But the creators of this movie managed to achieve something else. They achieved to create a movie that sparkles nothing. So many viewers before me described this movie with boring and uninspiring. And I know that just like me, they got this vibe long before the movie has ended. My advice to Marvel regarding this character: kill her. Release a tragic comics where she dies saving and on the ashes of her miserable heritage build a better hero that does not posses the mistakes the writers gifted captain Marvel.
Entire movie industry lately feels to me like a crappy businessman who is trying to push a terrible product which nobody wants while repeatedly stating that it isn't about money but rather something right and beautiful that the right consumers will appreciate. Should I count all the movies that barely broke even or brought a great loss in the last few years because of this stupidity?
This is a market, and you are selling, not selflessly changing the world through your movies.

","Despite the hype about its anti-male stance, and feminist message, Captain Marvel is a regular superhero movie that delivers on action, spectacle, and performances. The battle scenes are great, and the train fight scene from the trailer does not disappoint. I used to think that DC is better at spectacle than Marvel, but the spectacle, especially when Brie Larson finally becomes Captain Marvel, is much better. I like to see heroes fight using actual powers than martial arts, and Captain Marvel delivers in spades. The supporting cast was strong, and I especially liked Samuel L Jackson, who plays a more innocent version of Nick Fury. Jude Law is great, and so is Annette Benning. But the one who truly steals the show is the cat named Goose. He is so adorable, he steals all the scenes. He even has a few tricks on his sleeve too. Ben Mendelsohn's Talos elevates the material too. However, the story itself seems like a mixture of The Bourne Identity, Top Gun, a random buddy-cop movie, and Star Wars. The visuals seem like a recycling of set pieces from Thor, and the Guardians of the Galaxy. I admit that Brie Larson's Captain Marvel seems a bit stale, but she is not given much material. And we do see that Captain Marvel's subtly human side, but her emotions truly show when she is with Jude Law. In fact, Larson should be credited for being able to have chemistry with everyone onscreen; especially Samuel L Jackson. Though she has great moments with Jude Law, and Annette Benning. However, I feel more could be done about the character. I also believe that Djimon Honsou, and Gemma Chan were really underused. Honsou never gets to display his full potential as an actor like in his breakout role Blood Diamond. The same can be said for Gemma Chan, whose captivating performance in Crazy Rich Asians is the best part of the movie.

",I have never written a review here but feel i need to due to the massive backlash here. What did people want? This had to be a film that plugged a gap as CM is a progression film for after Endgame. We simply had introduction to the character that was decent for me and the 5 other people i went with. Granted her super powers are undeniable and she falls into the Superman bracket where they are almost too 'super' but she has absorbed power from the most powerful power source in Marvel material (well one of them) so should be.

","Didn't anyone read the reviews? The first one made so much because of the hype but after viewing it fell flat. Captain Marvel if you are the strongest Avenger I have some bad news. It's not the strongest Marvel movie closer to being the weakest Avenger movie. I really wanted to like it like ever other movie but it had a poor story, robotic acting and slow in some parts that just made me yawn. Only good part was the dragging special effects.

","First off a huge negative is the fact that the character of Captain Marvel herself has all the interest and personality of dry toast... lots and lots of dry toast. Maybe that appeals to some but not to me. The strange thing is that I don't think it can be blamed on Brie Larson's poor performance but rather an extremely mundane and joyless script. Second, there is absolutely no tension at all in any of the plot points. No danger to Carol or to anyone that is with her. With no sense of danger, there is no thrill to any of the action. Not when powered up Carol takes on the Starforce and not when Ronan launches missiles you know will not find a target or threaten anyone. Honestly, I have watched Agents of Shield TV episodes with more thrills and tension. This entire movie because of the ""meh"" factor didn't feel like a big budget MCU epic that we've come to expect. What aids to save face are its overall ties to that MCU. Fury was a bit of a neutered tool but he was still likeable and interesting. It was great to see young Phil Coulson even if ever so briefly. The Tesseract tie and the Skrulls were damn cool and they referenced what was to come without completely ruining what we've already seen and enjoyed in the MCU. (Except the Fury eye loss, that adds a BAD cringe factor) I seriously hope that for Endgame they limit Captain Marvel's presence because even after two hours spent with her she is just such an uninteresting character.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

And they beat you over the head with the theme ""relying on emotions and gut feelings is okay"" with no subtlety at all.
Characters develop unrealistic friendships after meeting each other for 1 hour. None of the humour lands aside from Talos. The action scenes were dull and I felt no investment in the characters. And it may have been my theatre but the audio mixing and sound design was awful, music fading in and out abruptly, and some scenes should have had people reacting but there was absolute silence.
The worst part of the movie may have been Brie Larson. The best way to describe her acting was that she only moved one part of her body at a time, either it was the eyebrows while taking, her arm or her eyes, while the rest of her body remained oddly motionless. She was so static and never acted like a normal human. A sight to behold, but for the wrong reasons.
Ultimately a bad movie, but not the worst marvel movie I have ever seen. The best parts being the supporting characters Talos and Fury, and some of the female empowerment scenes were inspirational.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019
6008,11 March 2019,dmshrmed,6," Equally as Dull as it is Inconsistent
","The majority of the film can be summed up with one word: meh. The rest of it is a little more complicated. Brie Larson's acting ranges from passable to unfitting. Many of the major plot drivers are loosely defined or borderline nonsensical. Cap'n Marv's power is all over the place. One moment she has difficulty fighting off a couple unpowered individuals. The next she annhilates a spacefaring warship by effortlessly propelling herself through it. The story itself is interesting, but it ultimately could have been told better. There are a few instances of arguably preachy feminism (the ""cockpit"" comment is the most laughable), but overall it takes a back seat to a wider statement about humanity's strengths as a whole. The pacing was strange, often fluctuating from too fast and too slow. I'm disappointed that the Skrull seem like they won't be big players like they are often depicted, but the films interpretation is ok even if a little cliche. Talos and the other Skrull are fun characters, but the actual villains are a little stale. Samuel L. Jackson successfully plays a younger, less experienced Nick Fury, and his exchanges with Goose the cat are some of the comedic highlights of the film. However, the overwhelming positive attention Goose has received when compared with characters who aren't just for comedic relief, says something bout the film as a whole. Considering the late addition into the MCU, I hope that Captain Marvel doesn't hoard too much of the spotlight from the characters we've been following for years in Avengers: Endgame. With that said, hopefully the character is improved by the Russo brothers before she inevitably takes the lead role in Phase 4 of the MCU.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

6013,14 March 2019,vinniec-53536,7," Mediocre and Forgettable
","Marvel Studios' 'Captain Marvel' introduces the world to the MCU's newest hero, Carol Danvers, a woman without a past. The film tells Carol's origin story (which takes place in the 1990's), and the plot revolves around her trying to figure out where she came from because, as far as she knows, her name is Vers and she's from Hala, capital planet of an alien empire called the Kree. However, she cannot remember her past, and she keeps having dreams of a life she doesn't know in a place she doesn't recognize. She's also a member of an elite Kree military unit called Starforce, and during a rescue mission gone wrong, she ends up captured by the Skrulls; alien shapeshifters with whom the Kree are at war. She escapes, but crash-lands on Earth and meets S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury, thus beginning their adventure together. The story starts off strong, but slows down drastically during the second act and never really regains it's momentum. There are a few unexpected plot-twists, such as the revelation that the Skrulls are actually the GOOD guys and the Kree are actually the BAD guys, and the identity of the mysterious older woman from Carol's dreams, but the plot itself is overall pretty mediocre and bland. The action is cool, but the CGI in the third act is very messy and takes away from the enjoyment of the film. The acting is okay. Brie Larson's performance felt wooden and one-dimensional, and she basically had like, 2 facial expressions the entire movie: stoic and smirk. Unfortunately, I feel like Brie was miscast as the character. The standout performances were Samuel L. Jackson (Nick Fury) and Ben Mendelsohn (Skrull commander Talos, who stole every scene he was in). Goose the Cat was also a scene-stealer, although I REALLY don't like that he was responsible for Nick Fury losing his eye. What irks me is that there really wasn't a 'main' villain, just a bunch of secondary villains. The closest we got to a main antagonist was Jude Law's Yon-Rogg, but there wasn't even a final battle between him and Carol, which I found disappointing. I also felt that the film had no real STAKES. Once Carol unlocked her full power, she didn't really have anything to lose because nothing was a challenge for her. The Earth wasn't in danger or anything, and she beat everyone SUPER-easily. The humor was good though, and Brie and Samuel had great chemistry and bounced off of each other very well. Overall, 'Captain Marvel' was a forgettable Marvel movie and felt like an appetizer, when everyone's hungry for the main course...'Avengers: Endgame'.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","I disagree with people who describe this movie as meh, mainly because this movie made me sad. There is just so much wasted potential as it is obvious that the premise itself has the works of a good story in between, but one which the movie fails to deliver.
The Story: The premise is very interesting but the main reason this movie doesn't work is the lack of tension. There is never a moment where you actually feel concerned for the well-being of the main character, and very few moments where you are concerned for the supporting characters. And even then, the tension is never allowed to build but is quickly dispelled. This is especially problematic here because this movie takes place in the past. If you remember how tensionless the action scenes with Legolas were in the Hobbit because Legolas is alive and well in LoTR, you know what I mean.
The script is poorly written which causes a lot of threads not sufficiently explored (i.e. the Kree-Skrull conflict, the nature of Captain Marvel's powers....)
You can pinpoint exactly where the movie kind off falls apart, which is the beginning of the third act. That's where Captain Marvel becomes... well a Mary Sue basically since she's infinitely powerful and has no apparent weakness. at this point you are just waiting for the movie to end because there are no stakes at this point really.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

There was some good humor scattered throughout, most of it coming from Nick Fury, and that's expected with the MCU.
What else is expected from the McU is fantastic effects and interesting fight scenes. Both these fell flat in this one.
The characters and the plot were not interesting enough to hold my attention, and the pacing was off. The beginning was slow, then it picked up a bit once Fury and Carol got to the secret base, got slow again once they found Carol's friend, and the climax just didn't work.
There was no real threat of failure, no real drama, and no real opposition for Captain Marvel. She could've beaten every villain on her own, as shown when she went super sayain. Also, she must've watched Solo, a Star Wars Story, because they went with the same ""hero shoots mentor to defeat him while they're in a standoff"" moment from that.
Overall, this movie ranks low in rewatchability, possibly even lowest on my list down with Thor 2. It never really found it's stride and it never really held my attention.

","I've held back on reviewing Captain Marvel, I wanted to let the film sink in and allow myself to come to a proper conclusion on my thoughts. One thing I will make clear from the very beginning. I wanted to enjoy this film. I rooted for Brie Larson (she was my top pick for the role of Captain Marvel). Marvel Studios have overall done a very satisfying job not just in adapting their comic book characters but also crafting very enjoyable films in the process. Unfortunately Captain Marvel is a dull mess with a weak story, an uninteresting hero and weak villains. The film succeeds in the humour department, the film has clever jokes and funny lines, especially between Carol (Brie Larson) and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). Praise needs to be given to the special effects team that managed to digitally deage Jackson in order to make him seem like a younger version of Nick Fury. This is the first time where the special effects didn't bother me. Usually the actor looks unnatural, as if they are wearing a digital mask. Jackson however, just appears younger, there is nothing that seemed out of place. The rest of the special effects also work spectacularly well (of course, its Marvel). The sets are futuristic, convincing and bring across the Utopian world of the main character. The action scenes are exciting, well shot and easy to follow. But this felt like a Phase 1 Marvel film to me. A film mainly required as set up for Avengers: Endgame, I find this to be extremely unfortunate because this character deserves better. Carol Danvers doesn't seemingly go through an arc, her worldview is never challenged which doesn't trigger a growth within her character. The strongest superhero films built an emphasis on a flawed main character whose experiences and mistakes shape his or her journey (think Spider-Man 2, The Dark Knight, Iron Man or Wonder Woman). Larson's character travels to Earth and is confronted with our way of life, which lead to some of the funniest scenes in the film. She is a fish out of water and perhaps doesn't see humanity the way we do. However, what does she take away? How will this impact her personality in the future? The character felt poorly written and I never had the impression I was watching a human being on screen. Her character felt constructed and not like a tangible and complex person. Larson tries her best with the role but the limited material drags her performance down to simply being a badass superhero with a sense of wit. Larson is a fantastic actress with an awesome range. She possesses so many more skills as an actress and the film doesn't allow her to express them. I hope that in future sequels the character can ripen up and grow on me more. There is certainly potential there, however a more independent and creative voice I feel needs to be present in order for the films to change their focus (i.e. Richard Donner, Tim Burton, Christopher Nolan, Sam Raimi, Taika Waititi or James Gunn).",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","Considering Marvel standards and huge budgets this is mediocre at best. Brie Larson's acting is about as good as a bag of potatoes and gave me the feeling that the other actors were either too busy trying to carry her or not even trying at all which also lead to poor character development.
Dialogue was lazy as hell filled with useless and cliche talk. Did they even care when they wrote this?
There were bits of good music turned bad by being played in unbelievably out of context and misplaced scenes.
Special effects were not great, again, considering the amount of money available for making this movie.
Samuel L. Jackson pretty much stole every single scene he was in without even putting an effort to it. Almost seems like he was put in the movie as a desperate attempt to make it ""not as bad"".
Fury's comedy bits along with Talos' were good and stole a few laughs.
Last displays of power by Captain Marvel were also pretty good as well as the connection to the Avengers and Endgame as the movie ended but it was pretty much it.
Make no mistake: to me this movie is ""more bad than good"" so a 5/10 is a very optimistic and respectable rating.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

6076,27 April 2019,CinematicGarbage,4," Not one of the best of MCU but still not too bad!
","Captain Marvel is the 21st movie of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It starred Brie Larson as Carol Danvers/Vers/Captain Marvel, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Jude Law as Yon-Rogg and more casts.
The story started in 1995 on the Kree Empire's capital planet of Hala, Vers had nightmares. To be honest, it wasn't a good beginning but it wasn't forgettable. Next scenes were quite forgettable because they showed nothing special so I couldn't remember much of it.
I could remember when she met Fury with 2 agents at the Blockbuster Video shop (wasn't it? I can't remember). When she was captured by Talos and other Skrulls, we were fooled by the movie (we though the Skrulls were villains). They tried to change Vers' memory (surely that could be remembered by most people, I think). The others scene till the end of the movie was not bad but a few people could remember many.
The story plot was not bad at all. Started in a planet, a young woman trying to find out who she was and took a lot of risks to restore her memory, surely audiences from the 90s would like that but for me, it was medium like a 7.5/10. Bet the 90s would like it more than I do.
Brie Larson was set to be the main character in this movie. But unfortunately, she didn't try her best to prove that Carol Danvers (or Vers) was main in here. I know she could do a lot better like in Room (2015), she won Best Actress. But in here, the MCU didn't take this movie seriously enough to make Carol the main character.
However, they did some marveloud CGI effects of Vers' powers and others. They were quite like real with no mistakes. The final battle was thrilling, full with power beams and other CGI, nothing was bad and I was actually impressed.
The right thing they did was to add humor to the movie. Luckily, there was Samuel L. Jackson, so things went okay! (also with Goose the 'cat') Even though there were hilarious scenes, I laughed a little and I think they should do more.
While watching the movie, I was bored for some time like in conversations, for example. They were really boring but to make things impressive, they did a lot better at the end even though the fight scenes weren't that epic.
So to summarize this, I would like to say that Captain Marvel (2019) isn't one of the greatest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it was funny, entertaining (at the end) but I bet the audiences of the 21st century wouldn't like it. Sorry Larson, the movie was fine but you didn't try your best in here!",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

Certainly not. It seems people create high expectations and then if the film doesn't meet them they simply bash with vague critics: ""bland characters"", ""boring story""... really? The biggest fail of the movie was that there isn't one big ""bad guy"", for me that was the biggest shortcoming. Carol Danvers is trying to push through in the ranks of kree army, unknowing of who she truly is. We're led to believe the Skruls are the villains here but is quite the opposite. By the end of the movie Danvers's power is so bleary beyond Yon Rogg that is not even a challenge for her. In the movie she lacks a rival, someone to really mesure her strength. Maybe if she had a sparring match with Ronan, someone who we already have an idea of how strong he is, Danvers's strength was better illustrated (even if she fought all members of her previous squadron).
About the story is found it entertaining. It turns out the Skruls aren't so bad after all, they are just trying to survive and the Krees are the real villains here.

Release: March 07, 2019, March 8 in USA
Running time : 124 minutes
Genre: Sci-Fi, Action
Director: Ryan Fleck & Anna Boden
FSK: 12
Main roles: ▪Brie Larson as Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel / Vers
▪Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury ▪Jude Law as Yon-Rogg ▪Ben Mendelssohn as Talos / Keller
Important supporting roles: ▪ Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson
▪Djimon Hounsou as Korath ▪Lashana Lynch as Maria ""Photon"" Rambeau
Annette Bening as Supreme Intelligence / Dr. Wendy Lawson / Mar-Vell
The film plays mostly in 1995, in some places in 1989. The most important places are the planet ""Hala"" and the earth ,in the USA.There are 2 post-credit scenes.
The Marvel adaptation ""Captain Marvel"" is about the pilot ""Vers"" who can not remember past events and gradually learns about their past and how she got her power. Afterwards she gets to know 2 agents of an organization who help her, as well as her former friend Maria.
I really liked the retrospect and the effects were great. As a superhero, Captain Marvel was rather modest but also interesting, there was no MCU movie with a woman in the main role. However, Brie Larson did well in her role In the movie there were also funny elements where I could laughed well, but that was not so often. Jackson tried to show his funny side of Fury and I think he did it well, he was very different than in the films before.He and Gregg both have been able to give their ""younger selves"" a character which have a deep impact on the chronologically later films / series. The end of the film, I found rather unspectacular as far as Fury and an important animal are concerned, have more The rogue (s) were different than I had hoped and therefore disappointed me. Captain Marvel's costume is well done and the colors look good on her (see the post above).

The music was perfect, as there are both exciting film music and pop / rock music from the 90s, which again underlines the time back then, 1995, and makes you feel more into the time.Actually in the fight scenes fits this music super pure.
The film is perfect for anyone who loves sci-fi, action and Marvel films. Larson symbolizes a strong woman, which is why the film has a positive impact on many people in my opinion. Theoretically, you can watch the film without any prior knowledge on the previous ones Watching movies, apart from the post-credit scene.
I give the film 7 out of 10 points. He was good but not really special. But definitely worth seeing.

Over the years I've loved the MCU's characters and the build up towards something that felt like a unity, like a team of flawed, hard working heroes who overcame themselves for something greater, for something good. I can't find that insight, that spirit of humbling shared experience, in this movie, no matter how hard the movie aims to that, and no matter how hard I really tried to give it a pass. Obviously there are some highlights (Ben Mendelsohn, Samuel L. Jackson, the 90s setting) but the elephant in the room is triple headed: uninteresting combo of script and direction, Brie Larson is awfully miscast here (she's been insanely good in other movies, but she really gets on everyone's nerves with that squeaky voice and blank look in her face), and a general landscape of been here, seen this, done that.

","What did you expect from the new Marvel movie? Epic battle scenes, romance between Carol and Mar-Vell, maybe some good acting by Brie Larson? Well, you're getting none of that, although the movie overall isn't as bad as you'd think by now.. First of all, comics fans will be in shock, because the canon violations are severe. Not that we haven't been accomodated to violations in the MCU before, but this case us special. Firstly, Mar-Vell turns out to be a Kree agent that pretends to be a female scientist. If that is not shocking enough already, Skrulls turn out to be a great peace loving race, Captain Marvel gets her powers not canonically, and it overall seemed to be a movie very mildly related to the comics. Secondly, the plot is honestly weaker than the latest Marvel films, the viewers hardly establish any emotional connection with the characters, as Carol is comparatively poorly opened-up and no seriously well-thought of relationships with her were present in the film. Brie's acting was bland and emotionless, although the other cast members were outstanding, Jude Law, Ben Mendelson and especially Samuel L Jackson proved their A+ Star status and enormous talent once again. The movie progressed relatively slow, but we still got a lot of ""Marvel"" stuff in it, like different easter eggs, good jokes and heartwarming moments that caused goosebumps. Only for that and for the sublime acting(and subjectivism as i'm a Marvel fan) this movie deserves a solid 6/10, clearly not pne of the best Marvel movies, but one you can enjoy, especially if you haven't read the comics.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","Or a Captain? Where's the sacrifice and improving of herself? No need for it apparently, she just kicks into the scenes (which has a decent fight secuences) and that's it. If you seek a movie that gets you caught into the character, that make you worry about the hero, this is not your movie. With some language that is unusual (despising men too obviously), the movie forces the female characters to be the heroes. A movie that could also have some Nick Fury's awesome moments, fail to deliver and instead gives us a Furry weak character, but he was still funny and ironic at least. Remember the part of the movie that a machine analyses the cat and says ""highly dangerous"",and then a analyses Fury and says ""human MALE, not dangerous""? I don't remember the sex of the cat. Anyhow the cat was a nice comical relief inside a weak plot. Good things of the movie: acting, VFX, secuences. Bad things: weak plot, obssesive feminist writing, lack of suffering from the hero, lack of information (how did Danvers became to be Kree?) and messing up the original Captain Marvel, yes, Mar Vell is just altered so terribly in the movie. These empty spots makes you wonder if this was a rushed movie, and it was. More time to see the chracter grow from impulsive to controlled and brave was needed. The movie was an attempt to make the character be loved instantly, but it certainly lacks 3 movies for us to get related to it and see it grow. Why is Captain Marvel a hero? Because she says so. Because Kree tells so. She doesn't become a hero, she is already a hero. Isn't that just anticlimactic? The movie is just ok, forgettable as there are no epic scenes of courage, nor lines that make your remember what certain character felt. A movie with good action scenes (not great ones), a predictable plot twist (because the plot was simple enough, the mentor becoming the bad guy), and a language that makes you wonder if isn't this meant for certain audience instead for a comic universe. This is a movie set in the 90s, with the 90s cliché alive and kicking. Almost forgot about the post credit scenes! Ah yes, I forgot because is nothing we already didn't know.

","I already knew before entering the cinema about the heavily (not female) feminist centered script, with such lines as: -Flergen, highly dangerous. MALE human, no danger (I watched the movie in my native Spanish). So, beside the man hating, I found a decent movie, just decent, not worthy of a rewatch. The takes and angles were pretty normal, acting was good from main cast, and plot was mmmmm ok. Apart from what I already said, I didn't like converting Nick Fury into Nick Furry. Do you remember that big, brave, capable shield agent? Nothing from him in this movie. This was a wasted chance to get us further into Fury's character and soul, but nope, just Nick Furry, cute and delicate shield agent. If you seek about the original Captain Marvel, it may be better for you to not watch this movie, which is understandable because this is Carol Danvers' movie, but some comics fans will be pissed off. Rest of it was classic Marvel good jokes + lame jokes, good VFX, mmmm mediocre hand to hand combat, a little fail in technology and logic with CapMarvel's power strength. I still don't know where she got the blue blood as the trailer shows. This movie should have been longer so we can get in-depth analysis of the characters, you just won't feel linked to them in this movie.

There were a few things that didn't make sense but they're small details. I'm a sucker for the 90's soundtrack but I wish some scenes were more orchestrated. Not every movie needs to recreate Guardians of the Galaxy. My biggest problem with this movie was the sound editing. In the beginning, Brie Larson and Jude Law are talking on a train and I couldn't hear them over the music. Perhaps this was my theater's fault but there are other parts that sounded poorly mixed.
If you're concerned that this movie might be heavy-handed with the feminism, rest assured that there was more in Wonder Woman. No one should be insulted about the politics of this movie because there wasn't any. I respect that and if anyone is arguing about gender blah blah, they want it there.
Overall. this movie felt like low effort snack before the big meal in April. I can understand doing this because now there won't be any wasted time in Endgame covering her backstory.

","After the catastrophic events of Avengers: Infinity War (and the pleasingly droll interlude of Ant-Man and the Wasp), Marvel Studios take us back to the 90s with Captain Marvel, starring Oscar winner Brie Larson as the titular intergalactic hero. It's a film that certainly has the weight of responsibility firmly on its shoulders; not only is it an origin story packed within the developed third phase of its universe, it acts as both a link to the past (a de-aged Samuel L. Jackson is unnervingly convincing) and a bridge to what is undeniably Marvel's big event of the year, Avengers: Endgame.
Captain Marvel is entertaining enough; the script may be inconsistent, yet it hits a number of laughs and the cast, from Jude Law to Annette Bening, are a spunky ensemble that bring a bright earnestness to the film. It's a fairly standard origin story that makes unapologetic use of Marvel's signature formula, often with results that, whilst usually fun, can't help but feel slightly circumspect and contained. We watch as Larson's Vers (as she is known on her supposed home planet of Kree) crashes on Earth, her memories of her past fragmented and her identity thoroughly muddled. This is much like the film's narrative itself which feels largely scattershot, jumping through flashbacks and glossing quickly over plot points with nonchalance. That being said, the movie is very entertaining, an odd tonal balance of Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-esque retro humour and the bombastic action stakes of Star Wars. Without a doubt, it's fun, with charm obscuring the more clunky moments in the writing.
Captain Marvel, of course, relies strongly on Brie Larson's leading performance. Larson is undoubtably a terrific actress who commits wholeheartedly to the role, making the best of the disappointingly little that is given to her. In the end, whilst the scope of her powers are cause for sensation, the character herself feels lost in her own film, attempts at pathos underdone and most of the best moments going to other characters.
The extended players stand out far more, with marvellous turns by Ben Mendelsohn and Lashana Lynch and a star-studded performance from a certain feline. The cast (even Larson to an extent) are the film's saving grace, carrying the film with a jubilance that can't help but bring a smile to the face.
Other aspects of the film also shine; the visual effects are polished and a distinctly 90s jukebox soundtrack works well. Far from spending its time in space, most of the film is grounded on good ol' Planet Earth, packed full of satisfying nods to the period.
All said, Captain Marvel is a tricky film; it can't help but feel like a stepping stone to the next point of the overall narrative of the universe, a safe and unambitious adventure muddied in franchise building. For me, however, the quirky humour, visual thrills and undeniable sense of fun are enough to give Captain Marvel a watch.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019
6153,22 September 2019,muvbuff-45737,4," Dull and boring
","Captain Marvel does everything by the numbers and brings nothing interesting to the table. Brie Larson is not charismatic enough to portray the character well and Captain Marvel cones off as arrogant and cocky without any consequences befalling her because of her being overpowered. She displays almost no weaknesses and is not a very relatable character for the audience. On top of this, the film is a formulaic origin story with no distinct tone. Overall, the film fails to do anything meaningful so that it can stand out in the vastness of the MCU.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","I was 15 when Iron man came out, I literally grew with this universe and is one of the things that I love in this life, how do I even start with this one. Let's do it with the good stuff, Sam L Jackson was as great as always beside the fact that they completely ruin the Fury character in this movie. The De-aging was amazingly done, some CGI were great, Ben Mendelsohn is one of the few highlights of the movies, but what was hand down the best part of the movie were those two tributes to the absolute legend that Stan Lee was. Now, the bad. Oh boy the is a lot wrong with this movie, apart from the whole pushing *world that starts with A and finishes with GENDA* with it's done in the most basic and unsophisticated way possible, it's just not a good movie, it's in fact one of the worst of these 10 years. The fight scenes were bad and messy. The MCU has earn after a lot of great movies and 10 years of work the loyalty of us going in with an open mind but it's just awful. It's sad because even tho the character it self is no where near as ""beloved"" as the prense and Larsson herself are claiming to be, clearly evidenced by the multiple reboots, low sales and constantly discontinued comics, it wasted probably one of the most interesting conflicts and characters of the whole Marvel comics, the Kree and Skrull war and the Skrulls them self. It also ruins a lot of characters, but no one more than Nick him self, an active shield agent, not only it had him holding a cat, witch by the way is way over praised as a lot as rest of most of the cast, while an retired old woman handle the Skrulls in an effort to forcibly make her look badass yeah like we didn't got enough of that. Also the whole cat - eye thing is a complete disgrace to the character, it was a thing that was teased years ago, it could have been epic and they decided to do it in such a stupid way for the love of God. Horrible decisions like changing MarVell sex, turn SHIELD into the office basically and the most problematic issue is the continuity problems that the movie brings. How did they get the tesseract, why SHIELD and Fury didn't knew about other beings in space on current time on the MCU, why is she ""so strong"" but you nerf some of the actual more powerful members of the whole Avengers roster like Thor, Hulk, Strange or Scarlet Witch. This is worry some in so many ways, the fact that this is supposed to be the character that is to be face of the new team and the new phase of the MCU, is very very worry some. Also the fact that Kevin Fergie saw this movie and gave an green light is way more worry some. I know fear for Endgame, as it's set to her to be an important factor in the movie, it's sad to see the MCU come down to this way. This could easily dictated the end of the MCU era.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

Scarlett Johansson shows more on screen charisma in 5 seconds than Larson did the entire movie. I've never seen her in another movie but have read that she has done well, so am not sure why she comes across so wooden in this one. The movie overall was fairly well done. Not up there with the first Iron Man or Guardians movies for sure, but an entertaining addition to the MCU. By the end of the movie she was insanely overpowered IMO. She would be comparable to Thor at the least. Being overly powerful is a weakness from a storytelling standpoint. I don't understand the fuss about it being the first female lead MCU movie.

The fights are not well choreographed, the visuals are poor and its not fun to watch.

Some of them are perfect and the others doesn't match the atmosphere of the movie.
Biggest problem of the movie was cast choice. Brie Larson is not a hero. She can not even run correctly if focus well on her style. She is not badass. She is more a cute girl who wanna look scary. As the matter of the fact she is barely on rage, most of the movie joking and laughing or giggling with Fury.

6223,29 March 2019,Robin_Yutani,6," Non-Comic Book Movie Fan's Opinion
","**Rating:** 7/10
**Positive Points:**
The action is mostly well shot and interesting, the comedy actually got quite a few chuckles out of me, the CGI that did look good looked great and the parts of the story that weren't directly related to her origin were pretty good. Samuel L Jackson is great as always and the effects used to make him look younger are great. Also the film takes place in the 90's but it's not shoved down your throat and the time period actually adds obstacles to the plot, which is interesting. The guy playing the head Skrull is pretty funny and well acted as well. I'm also pretty glad how they integrated the feminist side. It wasn't as shoved down your throat as I was expecting, which is relieving. Finally, the movie is only 2 hours instead of 2 and 1/2 which I like.
**Negative Points:**
Brie Larson's performance is very inconsistent. The only part she's actually good at is whenever she makes a snarky or sarcastic comment. When she's trying to be serious and dramatic, she's not as good. The way she gets her powers is really dumb in my opinion. I won't reveal it for spoiler purposes. There were quite a few moments that made me groan. Especially one big one towards the end. Some of the effects are pretty bad, but they're pretty quick moments and aren't super distracting. Finally, I wasn't a huge fan of what her main arc amounted to. It's almost like they didn't know how to end it, so they were just like ""uhhhh....laser""
**Final Verdict: **
While I don't have many other Marvel movies to compare it to, on its own, it's pretty average. It's not a bad time, but don't expect anything mind blowing.

6224,31 March 2019,magnusmax,7," Nothing Marvellous here (except Stan Lee)
","Captain Marvel... a film of controversy. And I'm probably about as ready to end the war between the ""manbabies"" and their antagonisers as any sane-minded person. It's true each film must be judged according to its particular merits and faults, rather than any personal values held by parties concerned with the production thereof. It's true that female heroines can (emphasis on ""can"") display moral traits exemplary to the exact degree that masculine heroes can. The antidote to the sort of character represented in Captain Marvel - which I believe is a partly fabricated ideal of one extreme of the political spectrum, and not an accurate representation of reality - is an attitude forgetful of its own nature - true feminism does not diminish the particular merits of male characters in an attempt to elevate those of a female character; nor does it make a conscious effort to ennumerate the disadvantages of the female sex in society. What everyone agrees constitutes a successfully heroic male superhero likewise applies to a female superhero - the self-less, virtuous ""giving"" spirit, that never tires from expending itself to increase the well-being of people everywhere, and in a personal way, those closest to it. Without stating political values, a female character can accomplish this in the same manner a male character can and always has - simply by leading a good example and speaking to the hearts and aspirations of audiences through actions of valor. Granted, Captain Marvel appeals to a wide audience, thanks to the fairly understated nature of its message. Yet there's always an irksome memory of an obscured intent in all of the movie, and it's this that tampers with its direction. I understand the reasons I have listed for a lack of connection with the character of Carol Danvers probably reek of enough ""toxic masculinity"" to earn the spiteful vitriol of many reviewers, and I'm sorry for that. I want good stories, like anyone else. But if a politically motivated campaign alters my feelings for a movie made partly with the intention of fuelling said campaign, I claim the first motion of offence as originating in direct opposition to me, and if I respond negatively, I haven't cast the first stone.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","I went into this movie a bit hesitant. I was not impressed by the trailers and Larsons' comments in the press were off putting. I truly tried to set aside any prejudice or preconceived fears and give this movie a chance.
The first 10 to 15 minutes of the film looked promising. Unfortunately, besides the touching tribute to Stan Lee in the intro, those 15 were the best part of the movie.
Brie Larson's ""Captain Marvel"" is boring and unlikable. She has no character arch or growth in the storyline. We have nothing to connect or root for. Her enemy is not really the Skrulls or I see, but patriarchy that has put her down or held her in check.
This movie destroyed on of the best storylines in the Marvel Universe. The Kree vs Skrull war was an epic plot. Turning the Skrulls into misunderstood refugees and the Kree into the bad guys has blown any chance of using that plot in future movies. And they changed it to push a damn agenda and narrative about border control.
That was the less blantant message being pushed. The extreme feminist message was insulting to many women and men alike. There were plenty of jabs thrown at men and lot's of subtle imagery to minimize or diminish men.
But, the most egregious insult to masculinity was how they took a man like Nick Fury and emasculated him. They changed him from a bad ass leader of a spy organization to a pussy who can only hold a cat during a fight scene while Maria Rambeau protects his ass. Then the movie insults us further by establishing that the damn cat scratched his eye and that's how Fury lost it.
Don't even get me started on the Tasseract and how the writers completely changed how Shield ended up with it.
How lame is it that Fury got the name of the ""Advengers"" from Larsons call sign as an Air Force pilot. So Tony Stark's phrase "" if we can't defend this earth, you can damn well believe we'll Avenge it"" means Nothing.
This movie is a hot mess. Nothing was fun.

There are some funny and emotional moments (very predictable by the way) which make it worth watching for once, but then there is the big issue with the movie forcing us into liking Captain Marvel, rather then actually giving us solid reasons for doing so. And that main issue consists in the not so well built personality of the main hero (her behavior and the way she expresses herself make it hard to be likable) and after that we have the big problem of her being extremely overpowered and just being a big mash-up of some of our favorite heroes - she lacks the unique look and charisma of the other avengers. And that makes her unmemorable and lacking the unique feeling of emotional attachment that you get when seeing the other avengers.

I think its enjoyable and entertaining, but it has quite a few flaws. The beginning is a little long, and takes a while to get up off the ground, but once it does the ball rolls, but maybe a tiny bit too quickly. It felt over and done, and the little plot twist element came out of left field. The movie still had a great premise, and actually wasn't overly political like people keep claiming (admittedly the trailer made it KIND OF seem like that), and I had a good time watching it. I think the film should have released years ago because of a lot of the plot elements, but it's still good. I did kind of have a problem with Brie Larson, but mainly just for the issue that she didn't feel as humorous as other people in the same universe, and when she tried to come off as witty and fun, it just didn't stick most of the time. Her acting was still superb regardless, and I think she is a great fit for the role, she just needs a bit of practice. A fairly solid film in a still solid universe, but I ultimately see it as just one more film closer to what I see as the end, and another fine addition to this cinematic universe.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","I have to concur with many of the other reviewers, this movie, sorry to say, had me bored. The one interesting bit, was the cat, or the ""flerken"". You know when a movie is bad, when the animals are more interesting than most of the actors. If Brie Larson was any more wooden in her acting, she would be office furniture. You can always rely on Samuel L. Jackson to put in a good performance and he doesn't disappoint in this movie either. His wise cracks nearly always elicit a smile out of me. Sadly, he was the exception rather than the rule. When a movie has this kind of budget, you expect the CGI to be good, and it is, but what makes a movie memorable is a great script, and sadly, this movie was lacking that, and frankly, the whole ""girl power"" agenda being pushed lately in movies is counterproductive. Enough of the agenda pushing already. Whether it's the not so subtle Trump bashing in the abysmal ""Homes & Watson"" movie, or this ""girl power"" effort in this movie, it just becomes another reason to switch off. Forget the agendas, just give us a decent script already! When you look at movies from the past, during Hollywood's ""Golden Era"", and are charmed by the clever, witty dialogue, you have to wonder what the hell happened to talent?

","Put the bias and gender politics aside, it entertained me enough. Overall, it's not great or groundbreaking but not that bad. And I will tell you why.
The MCU did very well to pay a respect to Stan Lee and a fallen soldier. Impressed!
The MCU casted actors well and they played very well. High praise to little Rambeau and Talos. Sam Jackson, Ben Mandelson and Annette Benning played his role well as usual. Brie acted fairly well especially the determination through her face and eyes (even I don't like her pitchy voice, sorry).
The de-ageing technology was well executed. At first was a wow then both young Fury and Coleson, with those faces, blended very well. The fighting related effects weren't that wow. It's okay but not groundbreaking. It's a bit odd CGI character on the space.
Plotwise, well it's 'traditional' origin storyline with an amnestic character. Too general. The big twists weren't that like unexpected. I can guess and my guess was right. Gender swap character was an ""ummmm okay, next"".
Yes, it contains the 'gender', 'superiority' and 'refugee' agenda in this movie, some was okay but some was too much for me to take.
And 'Marry Sue' existed - she easily adapted to new skills, unlike Ironman case with his early flights.
Post credits had 2, the first was good, the second was just like a tease.

","On March 8 one of 2019's most awaited movies were released the second to last edition of the Avengers movies. Captain Marvel was directed by Anna Boden and Rylan Fleck with their lead actress as Brie Larson who plays a role of a strong female super hero and we see Samuel L Jackson return as Nick Fury discovering the Avengers for the very first time
Larson character is seen going through though obstacles all along the movie as she tries to discover her who she really is and where she belongs. With the super powers that Captain Marvel posses she is an asset to the planet of Kree, and they plan to use her as a weapon. This is the place she calls home which has betrayed her; upon unveiling such crucial information Captain Marvel is seen to leave her planet as well as the place of her birth to an alternate safe haven. She assures Fury that when the time of complete doom arrives, she will be there to avenge the Earth by his side. We also get to know the story behind the infamous eyepatch of Fury's.
Overall it was a decent movie worth your while with all the cool CGI effects and the quick smart witty humor incorporated in the story line. However, if you have been a fan of the marvel comics the plot line of the movie might not match up with what the comic portraits, for example the story behind Fury's eyepatch is more badass to say the least but we can only assume that it was tweaked a little for the comedic purposes of the movie. The second major difference is that Marvel (mar-vell) the real captain of the ship from Kree was male in the comics and dated the super hero however in the movie that's not the case the real Marvel is portrait by a female who is trying to escape the horrors of her own planet. As a comic head I would rate the movie a solid 3.5 stars as wasn't as accurate as the book and I envisioned the characters a little differently in my head, unlike its predecessors unfortunately Captain Marvel came a hair short in my books.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

Jackson stole the show in my opinion as for Brie Larson, something was off about her acting as if she didn't understand the character. Don't get me wrong... i like Brie Larson and i think she is a good actress, but maybe that's just me. Ben Mendelsohn's performance was good too. As for the superhero moment in the movie that i was waiting for, i didn't feel it. I didn't get the chills that i usually get when watching a superhero movie whether it's a Marvel or a DC film, even the part where she fully embraced her powers and learned how to use them and she was destroying those missiles so easily, i didn't feel that this is the character that is gonna be a big part of Avengers: End Game as those scenes happened so fast you almost feel like they are unearned. The special effects in this movie were a hit and miss, certain visual effects were poorly executed specially in the third act during the part were she flew into space , although Samuel L. Jackson's De-aging visual effects were so good you won't even notice them during the movie and you tend to forget that they are being used in the first place. I'm not gonna talk about the villains of the movie because i feel that they were not the center of the story because even the Skrulls that were supposed to be the bad guys turned out to be the opposite and the plot twist that Jude Law's character turned out to be the villain was not so shocking in the end, the movie was so focused on how Carol Danvers became captain marvel that it kinda ignored those certain elements. As for the jokes, some were good and some weren't. I get that some people like the jokes in Marvel movies, but sometimes they try so hard to make jokes that makes you feel they are out of context. The Mid-Credits scene was very good as it ties directly to Avengers: End Game, and the End-Credits scene was not so important but worth watching nonetheless. Overall, the movie was okay, but it was below average compared to the other solo Marvel movies.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","First I want to remind everyone of what mediocre means. It means that something is of middling quality; neither bad nor good; indifferent. Said chiefly of literary or artistic works, ability, or knowledge, and hence of persons considered with reference to their mental power or skill.
This movie is almost perfectly mediocre. The acting is ok, esp. considering the actors. The plot is the usual, too easy to predict, origin story. There is really nothing to offend, nothing very original, nor anything that is different from any other origin story. As far as it being feminist, I imagined a man playing the same role, and really there would have been almost no significant change to the movie. Makes you wonder if the whole Marvel Universe is winding down to corporate toy level. Wasn't worth seeing in a theater. Sort of ok for a DVD watch. There is a lot that could have been done with this. A lot of material that could have made this character interesting, but only a bare minimum of that was done. There are a couple of plot points that go by way too fast. Her whole conversion is too easily done. Her whole mastery of power is too smooth. So we now have a Superman in Marvel. So what. They are going to have to create a kryptonite for her so they can have plots. The character herself is too bland, too perfect, too pointless.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019
6315,24 March 2019,jc-29071,7," Marvel's Captain serves as an intro to greate intergalactic intrigue
","Okay so the problem here begins with a basic rule, you never change the costume. The costume makes the hero and unless you make it better than the comics like in Iron Man or Spider man, the Tobey Maguire version and my favorite, because the symbiote spider suit was amazing! (although Tom Holland is great as is Garfield, although the second movie was not great he was and it would be great for both Holland and Garfield to appear in the second movie, some paradox etc.). The other troublesome issue was Captain Marvel was a man but there was a Miss Marvel and she was great, the costume was tighter fitting but I want to point out that Spiderman's costume is basically spandex, so is black panther's, so is Superman's, Batman, Venom, the Hulk is nearly naked (the savage brute!), and the list goes on, so I dont want to hear anything about a beautiful woman with awesome powers being able to wear a tight beautiful suit. Oh hey by the way DC I think we need a Supergirl movie, the same actress from the t.v. show would be great just please make her more blonde (Supergirl is a full blonde) and it would be great to have Wonder Woman make a cameo and the New Superman. Finally I just want to say the villains were great awesome. I think we all need another Thor movie, the last one just did not sit well with us, but Chris Hemsworth did and continues to prove he is a great actor ( even if some of the films were not that great, his performance in all of them continues to register with the fans). What went wrong in the last Thor film? The funny Hulk (it wasn't funny, and also the CGI of the Hulk did not look like it did in the first and second Avengers movie, I hope it will for ENDGAME you've made enough money off these films that you can't screw up on making a major character look rubbery and fake). Thor's humor was also off, all his films portrayed him as a serious character it should remain for the final film, the humor in the Avengers which occurs accidently with the humans around him is perfect! We need to see the conclusion of the Asgardians and their dilemma, where is their home? Can we know more about and see the Celestials? Also you better bring Loki back and I hope we see him in Endgame, he is just way too good a character and actor to get rid of him, especially if they can reconcile and be a team finally! Anyway just get this costume fixed for part two and perhaps show the original Captain as a mentor to help her through a tough situation. Keep the story tight and the action even tighter, bring in the SuperSkrull a worthy opponent like no other! Lastly in the third movie, the Imperial Guard with Gladiator! She'll need help for this one, perhaps the New Fantastic Four! Now that Endgame is winding down, I can think of no other cross character threat than the Beyonder to keep us around at the end of the credits to pull all the heroes together (did he create the infinity stones or was that the Celestials)and the Anti-Monitor to bring the JLA vs. Avengers Super Epic Crossover event as has never been seen in Cinematic history and one sure to beat the record of James Cameron's Avator and delve into the 3 billion sales! This has to happen, the fans want it and this will pull both fan bases together, for each battle there should be online voting (another first) before the movie so fans can decide if Superman will beat the Hulk (yes! but what a fight!), Will Iron Man beat Green Lantern (tough to say)? beleive me we all want to see this, oh and you might as well throw Thanos, Darkseid, Galactus, the Grandmaster, the Collector, the Elders of the Univers and the cosmic Silver Surfer into this whole intergalactic spectacle (who should have his own movie and have an intro in part two of Captain Marvel or in his own movie where she makes a Cameo with the Fantastic Four).

6322,8 March 2019,aedwards-04101,5," Mediocre at best.
","The movie isn't bad. It's decent. There were some iffy things regarding fight scenes where they were kind of boring and not that interesting but there still were fun fight scenes to watch. Set design was not good though, compared to Thor ragnarok or infinity war it was very uninteresting to look at. Skrulls were interesting though and I liked them. They were cool and there were nice little twists and turns with their shapshifting abilities. The movie was a pretty different style I would say up until the ending it went straight back to a boring generic superhero movie, but I'd say it was a little obnoxious. I really only had most of my issues with the character herself. The character has been around for a while now but how they portrayed her was just awful, like a Mary Sue. She was not good. She has no flaws and is so pompous and stuck up. Thor was pompous and stuck up but he had to work on that and become worthy in his solo movie. But in captain marvel, they endorse that behavior as if it's a good trait to have. No, it's just not my marvel without a flawed superhero. They changed around the story a bit to make it so she was responsible for the Avengers Initiative and that's honeslty a bit insulting to the Avengers in my opinion. I guess it makes sense though, since nick fury met her, he wanted to find more people like her. But still it took so long that its obvious they wanted to screw with the original stories. But nick fury was pretty involved, and their relationship in the movie was kinda nice, and they had some fun arguments and conversations along the way. Jude law was disappointing to me, and they just were all over the place with some story. Sometimes it was almost hard to keep track; it's almost like movies can't be simple anymore. But some fights were a bit dark and I noticed fight scenes were really shaky, fast and close up so you had no idea who was who. So overall, very mediocre and lazy all throughout but a lot of potential. They just tried stuffing way more than they could chew and it almost felt rushed. I would've cut a lot out, even some characters. I am a huge fan of the mcu and I don't want this to be the end. But honestly, I do believe she might ruin the ten years we love, and become the alpha of the mcu downgrading the rest of the avengers.

If you watch films containing krees you would know that they are basically bad guys. The film doesn't have any memorable fight scenes it was quite bland imo. The visual effects were quite good better than what you usually see in the marvel movies. The acting was ok the choice for captain Marvel was ok but In the film she was a little bland like she could've had more enthusiasm. The others were good such as Samuel Jackson, Ben Medelson was good, Jude law was ok. But I hated how they used Coulson and Ronan in this film. They could've used them longer than 2 mins. The credits scenes were good. The first was goooooood and the second was ok. I just realised I've used ok in this review a lot. This shows that for me this movie was ok.

","The script was very good. The twist that happened in the story about the villains being, in fact, the Kree's was a good idea from Marvel. Well, I started watching the movie with the expectation of the Skrull being the villains. But the formula used by Marvel has become repetitive: the protagonist gains their powers, loses their powers and soon after an event, she returns with their powers. Also some jokes were predictable, even if they were good. For example: One of the last scenes in which Carol was ""fighting"" against his mentor, where he begins a typical villain speech and is soon interrupted by a heat ray from the Captain Marvel, as well as the Hulk scene with Loki in the Stark Tower .
The acting was fine. Brie Larson (Captain Marvel) has had many facial expressions, contrary to criticism from some people. The best performance for me was Samuel L. Jackson, he demonstrated a lot how young Nick Fury acted before (with some naivety) like when he trusted Pegasus.
The special effects were beautiful, like Captain Marvel's rays and the Kree's technologies. But Marvel failed in the scene where Carol was falling from the Kree ship shortly after losing her powers, the green screen effect behind her was very visible. It was so ugly it did not looked like something from Marvel, it looked more like a GIF than a special effect. In addition, there were no visible errors.
Final considerations; the characterization was very good, from Skrulls skins to Kree's special clothes. In addition, the movie itself contributes a lot to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (UCM), since it explains since the emergence of the Avengers initiative (which would initially be called ""The Defenders"") and even as Nick Fury loses his eye (which way more silly, stupid to lose an eye). At the end of everything the movie entertains and explains quite a lot the origin of Captain Marvel.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019
6352,9 March 2019,g-freemanhl,7," Allright origin story movie
","Movie itself is... fine. Brie Larson portrayal of Captain Marvel could be better - in particular movie could have been a little bit more self aware and less serious, especially in some particular scenes. This movie leaves the feeling that it's taking itself a little bit too seriously.
Not going too deep into spoilers - there is an interesting deviation from comics universe, which frankly I found interesting. After all movies don't have to follow comics letter by letter.
Overall story arc is somewhat boring, and some parts of the movie feel a little bit dragged out. Whole remembering part could be written to be more cohesive and just overall better. Main character - namesake of this move - feels too overpowered compared to her opposition and it doesn't work for the movie. There is never any tension past opening when we are demonstrated how overpowered she is. There is no real threat to Captain Marvel at any point of the movie, which I think is the reason why it's rather boring.
Finally Captain Marvel's overdone seriousness doesn't do movie any good. Other characters within this movie do much better because they allow themselves to smile and be funny here and there, which only makes sense for this movie. In context of this movie with an issue I listed just above - absence of any real threat or challenge to main character - this is vital for movie to not take itself so serious. There has to be room for character cast to break up the pretentious seriousness with a joke here and there, humorous moment, cackle or just warm human smile. This is necessary to counteract this dissonance between seriousness that most of superhero movies carry and ridiculousness of what's happening on screen - because powerful superheroes without evenly or even stronger opposition simply plowing their way through movie is anything but serious. It's absolutely clear from first minutes of the movie that any opposition here exists for the sole purpose of being humiliatingly splattered by protagonist - Captain Marvel - and that just doesn't come together nicely with overly serious acting in place. Some characters are not as guilty of this - in particular Nick Fury strikes a good balance of being serious and slipping in some humor and silliness here and there. So do some other characters.
That's why I give this movie 7/10 - it's still a solid origin story movie that has some problems here and there, but these problems are localized to certain characters (Captain Marvel herself) and specific narrative segments and how they are done (somewhat boring mid section of the film). And they are not downright horrid - it's just they could be done better with a little more effort.
Overall movie does it's job of setting up Captain Marvel for Endgame, although not particularly good job. Some questions still remain unanswered. Captain Marvel is portrayed to be ridiculously overpowered which raises question - how will she fit in avengers? Will she downright overshadow everyone? If so it doesn't feel right that barely established character will take spotlight from other members of Avengers who went through way more character development over numerous entries by now. This also threatens to turn Endgame into similar one-sided kind of movie with little to no tension. Which hopefully will not be the case and Marvel will bump Captain Marvels power level down a whole notch to create more tense and interesting narrative where Brie Larson's acting from this movie will be more appropriate due to more grim and serious nature of Infinity War with much less room for smiles and comedic relief.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

The film left me completely 'well I watched it'... The effects ,sets, costumes and every other technical and setting type thing was up-to the best marvel has to offer
in any of their films.
The story though was simplistic, for me the twist was something I didn't know having not read the comics so while unexpected and welcome it wasn't enough in itself to be a wow moment...
The character of Captain Marvel is flat...the film takes up about 3/4 of the movie on resolving her back story but to what end. Its honestly not worth the ride to find out that's why shes stoic because shes always been stoic?
How she got her power is haphazardly explained in the story and confusing as to what was given to her and what was an accident and why that accident gave her powers to begin with?
Her relationships in the film are explained in a disjointed disorienting fashion all except the one with her air-force buddy that takes most of the time on yet your left with 'so what' feeling like well OK they were close and shared the same goals and tribulations facing sexism in the air force together but that all could have been covered in five minutes not the length of time it took for zero payoff in understanding the characters...
You could forgive the simple story line if the characters were developed in an interesting way... but they aren't
The acting in the film is hard to judge because of this... I feel it would be unfair to judge Brie on this or any of the other actors as it feels to me it was down to scripting and direction rather than portrayal by the actors themselves",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

I wouldn't consider her the highlight of the film but you can clearly see that Larson tried her best to portay the character. The plot was really good. There were many plot twists and character developments that made it interesting and intriguing. The script was also very humorous and witty. All though, the movie falls flat at the action scenes. The choreography and scale of the fights were severely underwhelming and I was really disappointed.

","Captain Marvel: The most awaited movie before packed adventure is great as an entertainer but just lacks a bit of depth in storytelling and direction. The actor's performances are the highlights of this movie. Brie Larson does an incredible job as Captain Marvel who turns quite unpredictable and indestructible when filled with anger. While on the other hand, Samuel Jackson who is playing Nick Fury adds a good amount of humor and sarcasm to his character. Also revelation behind Nick Fury's pirate eye is spot on. The CGI seems to be just fine as there have been way better graphics in the previous Marvel movies. It's Carol Danvers all the way as she is a one woman army who literally is just way too powerful for the antagonist. Which also doesn't make the fighting scenes much interesting. The soundtrack also has failed to impress though. Overall a great adventure movie which exhibits the boundless power Captain Marvel has and wait for the best scene. No spoilers.

","I'm going to start this off by making something clear, Captain Marvel is worth watching. Throughout this review I will criticize it a lot, but the movie itself really isn't that bad, it's a decent marvel movie, I was just expecting more.
The First reason why it was really disappointing was because it had a great story to work with but didn't do the story justice. If you ever watch the movie you'll see what I mean the story is a complicated war story that has many different parts, however the movie itself: the acting (except Samuel L Jackson), the directing, etc. were really mediocre.
First comes the acting, while the acting isn't necessarily bad it isn't good either. Bree Larson should've been better in the role of Captain Marvel. I actually think this was the fault of the directors read Larson is a quite a good actress but I don't think the way she approached the character( first comes the acting, while the acting isn't necessarily bad it isn't good either. Brie Larson should've been better in the role of Captain Marvel. I actually think this was the fault of the directors read Larson is quite a good actress but the way she approached the character (which was probably the way the directors told her to approach the character) felt kind of out of place sometimes. The character was quite bland and you didn't care much for her, and that is a huge reason why the movie was bland. There were many moments that would've been awesome if the character had been awesome, but the character wasn't awesome.
Also when it comes to just the execution of the movie there were many things that just didn't feel right. Oftentimes you didn't really care for any of the characters besides Nick Fury (who was awesome by the way). Also the movie had an extreme lack of tension expecially at the end. You didn't really care for any of the characters in the movie and you knew Nick Fury was going to survive because he had to be in avengers and other movies, so even when fights happened no tension happened. Also Captain Marvel eventually became so powerful there was literally no tension at all.

","There has been a lot of buildup and hype leading to the release of Captain Marvel, the MCU's first female helmed solo film. There has also been a large and very loud pushback in certain quarters of the internet. Depending on who you listen to, this movie is either a bold new chapter for Marvel, unlike anything that's come before, or the worst thing the studio has ever done. In reality it's neither. It's a perfectly good, highly entertaining popcorn flick, but maybe not the groundbreaking, genre shifting epic it was sold as.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

6460,13 March 2019,DanielNeil1237,5," A very average and run of mill entry in the with some good things in it.
","The movie is not terrible it has a few good scenes and things in that I really liked it, but it is overall a very forgettable and bland movie. Let's start with the positive aspects of the movie first. Samuel L Jackson is of course always fantastic in the movie even though the dialogue in the film isn't very funny and is sort of boring. You can tell he is trying his best to make the material work. Another positive aspect of the movie is Goose the cat where most of the movie's humor comes from. The final positive aspect of the movie is the effects in space they are not mind-blowing or anything we haven't seen before but it is still cool to watch things go boom! even if the action scenes are not very memorable and sort of boring. Now to the negative aspects of the movie Captain Marvel her self is not very heroic at all in the movie and it tries so hard to make you care when you really don't,Most of this comes from the dialogue and Brie Larson herself her performance feels very wooden like she is just going through the motions of the character without much energy. Another issue is that the film feels very bland without much style compared to other movies in the MCU.Like with those films those directors brought their own style to the movie here it feels like anyone could have directed it. The film itself doesn't have much character or style to it. Also, the villain was pretty good with Sam Mendelson,but I wish they would have done more with his shapeshifting abilities. Overall this just a-okay popcorn flick that the whole family can enjoy without much else,or anything new added to the Marvel formula.I also think the tribute to Stan Lee at the beginning was a nice touch.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","I went to see this movie with a friend of mine, see, I'm the ""Marvel fan"" and he's more like ""I don't particularly like it but it's cool"". And so the movie begins and as I'm watching it, I have this feeling like something is missing. I can't tell you what, though I think it has something to do with the framework of the movie. In Thor (2011), de have a real overview of Asgard and what is Thor up to, in Guardians of the Galaxy, we got a proper presentation of Peter Quill, same in Doctor Strange when we got to see Strange's surgery skills. In every other origin story, there's a presentation of the hero that I think is missing in this movie and I also assume that it's because of that lack of effort in introducing her that there have been a lot of hateful comments on this film. I think it might have Brie Larson struggling to get into this character because it hasn't a strong basis.
Then, I have to say, I found the first hour very boring, sloppy jokes, slow scenario... . But the most striking fact comes at the end ! So, back to my not-a-marvel-fan friend. As the second hour went on, he started to react to the scandalous ease with which events were happening. It's like it is way too easy for all the characters to do what they wanna do. And the worst part is at the end. In the very last 15 minutes I think, when (*SPOILERS*) Captain Marvel releases her full potential. Actually, I watched Justice League last year and at the end I was feeling like ""so Superman resurrects and all your problems go away, right ?"". Well guess what, it's even worse with Captain Marvel, going in outer space with no helmet, blasting spaceships with her barehanded... . I understand the need to make us understand that she's an extremely powerful character, I just don't understand why it's done only at the very end of the movie. I think that also is due to the bad introduction.
I will finish with some good points, unlike most people (from what I read) I think Brie Larson can be a great Captain Marvel, production and cast just have to take the time to make things the right way. I think she'll figure out how to get into this. I also like the fact that Captain Marvel is an amazingly powerful character, especially given how strong Thor was in Infinity War, it seems like he finally found someone to talk to.
(I also think that the moment in the second Endgame trailer (""what ever it takes"") when Thor tries to impress Carol then says, leaning on his ax ""I like this one"" was intented by the production as an answer to all the hateful comments on Captain Marvel. It's like ""the most powerful character of the MCU likes her so what's wrong with you?"". But that's just an assumption)
To conclude, I want to tell anybody who's reading this: go to see this movie as a part of the MCU story but don't expect an outstanding movie, go to get information about the character.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","6. That's how many stars out of 10 I give this movie, and honestly I think I'm being very generous. Breaking down the movie into parts, I'd give effects (C.G.I., etc at good 9, maybe 10! The work on de-aging Sam Jackson's character, Nick Fury, was so good, it was almost hard to believe. The other effects, I.e. explosions, particle beams, whatever, all look good too. The overall story I'd give a 7, maybe 8. Decent, but while they included a couple surprises, they weren't that surprising.
The acting? Well, almost all the actors were between good and really good. Only a couple were just o.k. and only one was not very good at all. The problem is, the actor that was the worse, was the lead, Brie Larson. Her performance would have been spot on, had she been playing a cyborg, with no feelings or expressions. Most of her acting was somewhere between a grimace, or smirk. She had those two expressions down pat! Beyond that however, I couldn't tell if she was happy, sad, angry, scared, or just constipated.
A poor performance by the lead is tough for any film to recover from, and this one for me just couldn't.

","I really wanted to like this movie, in the end I just couldn't get past some glaring problems.
Fight scenes were almost unwatchable because of the nauseating camera angles, shakes and cuts.
Brie Larson, just isn't athletic enough to pull off the action scenes, running scenes, anything really. Not everyone can. They probably used a double for the low camera angle butt scenes.
Her acting delivery is just really bad, probably because that's the way she was directed.
Other performances were solid.
FX was good
Story was fragmented with all the flashbacks, flash sideways, etc., no smooth transitions between plot, subplots. There were no subplots really.
Annette Benning's character, changed from Male to female for.......reasons.
Now for the in your face feminism. There is no need to have flashbacks showing baseball, go carts, military training, bar scenes, that blatantly show her father, coaches, and other men berating her. Even as a child she was berated and dismissed, all in order to set up the ""I've been dismissed all my life so now I'm going to pull out all the stops"" scene. Movies can have a strong central female character without all the unnecessary beratment. The Male pilot who says ""you know why they call it a cockpit"" gets his head taken off in a CM fist blast while playing on the memory screen playback.

Not that all of the acting is bad (Ben Mendelsohn reminds me of Ben Kingsley in a good way, Lashana Lynch reminds me of Terrence Howard (Rhodey from Iron Man), and Goose the cat (Top Gun reference?) is more than he seems), but Brie's acting was rather poor. I get that she's supposed to be emotionless per a line repeated twice in the movie, but it almost looks like that line was used to justify how bland her acting was.
Then there's the cringe factor brought by liberal doses of unrealistic sexist behavior toward the main character and feminist ""girl power"" moments by the ""girls"". Although the music does match the period, it's pretty conspicuous how the titles seem to further the agenda.

","This movie has received a lot of coverage leading up to and since being released. I am a middle aged, white, straight, well educated and successful married guy. I read the critics (people like Nedrotic.com and others). Most of what they share is spot on, the free speech thinkers do represent the fans. I only went to see the movie last night because my 9 yo daughter asked me. My expectations were very low!
The movie blew me away, and the icing on the cake was the look of joy on my daughter's face.
The film does not press any agendas, neither of sex, race, religion or politics. It is a science fiction fantasy story, well told. The plot is sensible, understandable, and heart felt. It was fun, enjoyable and entertaining. The pace was perfect, the imagery was fantastical and colorful, the characters were engaging. I am a real, hard core fan of the universe and the genre, this movie was a delightful piece of work that delivered.
Brie Larson, as a human being is a little naive and dare i say it, ignorant, living in a privileged world where she is able to use her sex to gain advantage, setting feminism back 5 decades! But, she delivered a great performance, I loved her in the role. Most luvvies aren't that smart and survive on the words written by others! So lets not be too hard on her, she acted beautifully and nailed the role.
The movie does not fit in the Marvel universe perfectly, but lets remind ourselves that this is fantasy, perhaps the fans should also show some imagination!
Captain Marvel's legacy will be set in stone in the Avengers: Endgame, we have establish characters that the fans have a lot of love and loyalty for. All I ask (if I could!) is that the movie makes protect the spirit and soul of the marvel universe that was inherited by the fans on 12 November 2018.

So after we left we discussed that there we woman who were strong and dealt with problems man couldn't handle and we came to the following conclusion:
1. Cap. Janeway from Star Trek Voyager (who was promoted to admiral after she returned from the other side of the galaxy and represented the Federation in the best way possible without pushing gender politics and crap.)
2. Seven of Nine from Star Trek Voyager - chief science officer. (who demonstrated she could handle any assignment man couldn't handle)
3. B'Elanna Torres again from Star Trek Voyager - chief engineer on the ship. Although she arrived to the ship late she could fix everything on it.
4. Col. Samantha Carter from Stargate franchise.
5. Ripley from Alien

I enjoyed the movie, though, as some others have mentioned, it had some issues and concerns. One of the characters at the beginning kind of give away the fact that there will be a change of heart (hint: the character was in Guardians of the Galaxy).
So many of the ""twists"" were completely predictable. Upside was the return of some of our favorite characters from previous MCU movies.
I am really curious how this character is going to fit in in the next Avengers movie, and how she is going to develop.

6561,14 March 2019,johnny_joko,5," Captain OP
","So I just watched Captain Marvel yesterday and I decided to post this review. There were 5 things that I didn't like:
1) The plot was far too confusing (especially in the first half of the movie) but you start to figure things out in the last 30 minutes.
2) We never get a good enough explanation about all of her powers, just that she was given these powers from the blast that occurred after she shot the plane's engine the day Mar-Vell died.
3) I think that the only characters that are genuinely interesting in the film are Fury, Coulson and Talos. Carol Danvers has some good moments in the film but overall she seems to be bored throughout most of the film. Brie Larson, even though she is a good actress, might not have been the best fit for the role.
4) Captain Marvel is WAY too overpowered! I mean in no point after she controls her powers do we feel that she can even get hurt, let alone get killed. That's one thing that I don't like about Superman and even he has a weakness (cryptonite). We never see anything that can even put a scratch on Captain Marvel, so that makes the fight sequences seem a little underwhelming.
5) The last thing that I didn't like was the not-so-subtle feminist-SJW propaganda throughout the film. Ok, we got it the first time, can we stop seeing the same scenes over and over again please?...",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

6572,9 March 2019,bendi_in_luv,7," Enjoyable but not memorable.
","George Lucas's unedited ideas of how Star Wars: A new Hope would have began should be taught in all theater classes; that movie was truly saved in the edit. Captain Marvel, however, was not. If Captain Marvel was our introduction to the Marvel universe, we would not be seeing a sequel. That is not to say it is not a good movie, but it is flawed, and enough so that it cannot stand all that impressively on its own.
Three great things about the movie:
1) Thalos/Ben Mendolsohn plays a convincing and relatable villain. He possibly played his role better than anyone in the movie.
2) Nick Fury/Samuel Jackson plays his role very well too. Fury and Thalos were the high points, definitely carrying the movie. I never felt myself getting lost in the movie, or even really drawn into the story, unless one of them was on screen. And I did notice myself losing interest in the movie with their absence. Not all of the other performances were bad, but no others really stood out.
3) Goose/The Cat was a surprise and had the entire audience laughing. Without spoiling anything, being reminded of Rathtars from Disney's ""The Force Awakens"" was depressing and being reminded of Groot felt like an uncreative knockoff. Otherwise, the ever-present orange tabby was fun.
Three not so great things about this movie:
1) Pace. There is a good story here, possibly a great story. But it is not well told. The characters and plot are poorly introduced; not so much that we, the audience, feel like we are being hit over the head there is so little subtlety, but enough so that it felt mundane. It is like picking up a new video game and spending the first hour just grinding through tutorials. There is no room for the audience to question anything, or wonder what will happen next, let alone make mistakes. And by the end, with all of the shout outs, references, and cameos spilt, I wonder if there will be anything entertaining enough left to merit a second viewing. Action and music can help fill the void, or cover it up, but in the end this movie lacks substance.
2) Physics. Science may not matter to everyone, but sticking with the established physical rules of a given universe is key to believability and immersion. The Avengers universe is OUR universe, and while we are asked to just accept some things, like magical gem stones, less magical things should follow the laws of physics. Too many times, this movie traded out our universe for the Harry Potter universe, each time disconnecting anyone over the age of 13 from any sense of awe or continuity.
3) The main gal herself. Brie Larson/Captain Marvel is either poorly directed, poorly edited, poorly written, or just a bad actress. perhaps all of the above. While she wasn't unbearable to watch, like Black Panther's mother was, she wasn't a side character with 3 minutes of screen time either. If the writers were trying to make a snarky, sassy main character, well, they almost got it. Captain Marvel comes across as a stuck up and immature teenage glam girl catastrophe. And that worked at first! When you have an invincible hero, you make the story interesting by having said hero fail to their inner demons. The problem here is that Captain Marvel never overcame her inner demons, and won out anyways. While the character development was better than Superman's, it still felt hollow. A better editor would have cut introductions shorter, left out unnecessary flashy action, and focused longer on showing some character progression. Oh, and Brie Larson cannot run. Perhaps blame it on an awkwardly tight costume, but the first time they showed her running down a hall, I just stared dumbfoundedly wondering what on earth she was doing. Fighting, they did a passable job of making her look like a somewhat competent hand to hand combatant (she's got nothing on Scarlet Johansson's Black Widow), but for the love, please do not show her running on screen any more. Especially not next to people who do run. Might as well be showing Phoebe Buffet running around D.C. with Captain America yelling ""On your left.""
In closing, some reviewers argue that this movie is simply another attempt by Disney at promoting their feminist agenda. I did not get that impression at all, and I think the anti-feminist and anti-Disney agenda may be being unjustly driven by extremists in this case. The only times I was concerned that bad morals were being promoted were in the immaturity of the hero and the idea blatantly put forth at one point that glory seeking should take precedence over motherhood and child-rearing. In short, if your moral standing is such that you took no issue with Frozen, you will likely have no issue with Captain Marvel either.
Overall, it was a fine film. Samuel Jackson and Ben Mendelsohn elevated it at times, and there is a pretty decent story here. It could have been better. I would suggest watching it without any grand expectations and you will likely not feel like you just wasted two hours of your life.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","Honestly very dissapointed with this movie. Saw the trailer months ago but didn't find it very exciting. But i went and watched the movie anyway to see the whole thing. And i'm still dissapointed. I don't think Brie Larson is the right actress for this film. She may have acted well in films like Room but on this film she just comes across obnoxious and her acting feels too one-note. It's like she was bored of the film just like i was. She doesn't show any range of emotions and just feels like she did this movie just for the Disney- Marvel Big Bucks and recognition. Maybe Marvel should recast her. As a long time MCU and Comics fan and seeing the fan reaction i don't think she would be the right person to portray MCU. Fans already seem tired of her behaviour mainly with all of the political statements she made. I honestly don't believe she would last 7 movies and even if she continues unless some radical changes happen with her acting or her behaviour outside the movie; as in not many people like forced poticial agendas in their favourite form of media be it tv shows or films. If Disney truly cares for the future of MCU they should really think over on casting Brie Larson as Captain Marvel. Also, what's with making captain marvel so overpowered, that aspect makes 0 sense to me. This amazing superhero universe builds up 10 years of amazing characters and at the end they just add a character that's surpasses all the characters by a mile and a half. No build up nothing just gives her infinite power from the start. Whoever wrote the script for this didn't do a good job. Fix mcu while you still can Disney.

","Good enjoyable film having no previous knowledge on Captain Marvel. With no stand out moment for me means some minor complaints/questions become more apparent.
Brie and Samuel work well together and bounce off each other with funny lines. The many relationships in the film are well played for what little time each is given. The plot and story are good but we are given information early which just makes us have to wait for Captain Marvel to catch up to us. We are not necessarily involved with the journey but waiting for it to end and join up with the rest of the MCU. Humour throughout is good, music might be well chosen but not well placed. Early action/fights have too many cuts and angles for my liking. Action towards the end flows a lot more and really shows off Captain Marvel's power well.
Too much is thrown into what should be a tight origin story but is forced to relate itself to the rest of the MCU too much. Not much to complain about but also not a lot to shout about, unfortunately.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

I still don't understand why she's so powerful, yet, in the film, she's completely unstoppable in a very boring way. Think of it as a superhero movie with no real villain to be scared of...at all. They tried to tie in 90's music and pop culture the way Guardians did with the late 70's and early 80's, but not nearly as good a job. The soundtrack could've been awesome but there wasn't enough of it, if that makes any sense.

6621,9 June 2019,cwt-73297,6," The Worst Movie in Phase 3(Still Fairly Good Though)
","(WARNING, INCLUDES ENDGAME SPOILERS)
After Avengers: Age of Ultron, Marvel went on a winning streak of very good and great movies, until this movie. Captain Marvel had me worried with their string of trailers because they were just average, not a good sign when it comes to a property like Marvel who normally has great hype inducing trailers. After the film came out though I'm glad to say it was fairly good. The fight sequences were fairly good. The Just a Girl fight between Carol and Starforce was the only one where it had me smiling in happiness. The cast gave good performances, with standouts being Ben Mendelsohn, Brie Larson, and Sam L. Jackson. Brie Larson and Sam L. Jackson had great chemistry. Mendelsohn was a great fake villain. It was also nice seeing Clark Gregg back in a Marvel movie. Also I like how they gender switched Mar-vell and cast Annette Bening to play her. I also liked how they portrayed the Supreme Intelligence. The best thing about the movie, however, was Goose. That cat was hilarious and was the funniest thing about this movie, with Talos and Nick Fury coming in second. I loved every scene he was in. Also the Stan Lee tribute at the beginning was great, along with his cameo, as usual. I like how it related back to his cameo in Mallrats. The CGI de-aging look phenomenal on Fury and Coulson. I also liked how they twisted the whole Kree-Skrull war idea in making the Skrulls the good guys and the Kree the bad guys. Granted I'm disappointed that we probably won't get that Secret Invasion movie now but still it was a good twist.
However, the film is not without its flaws. The movie didn't give me the excitement that most Marvel movies give me. There were only a few moments that I smiled but that was during the one fight scene and the funny parts. Also Fury's eye was the one thing I hated the most about this movie. That was a huge copout having the cat scratch it out. It took away from the impact of the line in Winter Soldier. I don't care if it was an Flerken, he trusted a freaking cat, and he got his eye scratched out because of it. It was stupid. Also the naming of the Avengers Initiative was kind of a copout but I didn't really mind it as much as the eye scenario. Brie Larson's performance felt a tad wooden at certain moments while she was on Earth and her chemistry with Lashana Lynch's Maria Rambeau wasn't really strong. The action sequences weren't really the exciting caliber action sequences I know Marvel can make and do. The film had no distinct style to it either. It didn't really set itself apart from the other films in the MCU. It kept trying to put different types of movies into one movie and it didn't really work well. It felt like it belonged in Phase 1. Until Endgame came out I got worried because Captain Marvel was supposed to be the most powerful character in the MCU and the new face of the MCU after Endgame and this movie didn't get me on board with it. Then Endgame came out and I changed my mind, mostly. It's sad when I say that Avengers: Endgame made me like Captain Marvel more than her own solo film. In her film she didn't really feel like the most powerful character. Then Endgame came out and she took on Thanos and obliterated his ship and didn't flinch when he head butted her. Fair to say I'm more on board now than I was back in March.

There truly is no such thing as bad publicity, and the amount of money this boring movie raked in shows it.

6642,7 March 2019,Shawnspenstar,6," A Pretty Decent Start
","I want to start by saying the movie isn't perfect, but has many pros to go along the cons.
The acting was one of the strongest points of the film. Brie Larson brings her own special essence to title character, and you can definitely see her character develop as her memories begin returning and the plot unravels. Jude Law, Ben Mendelsohn, and Lashana Lynch all added to the cast power with their competent acting abilities. And of course Samuel L. Jackson is always a pleasure to see on screen as Nick Fury.
The plot itself is not one of the strongest plots that the MCU has come up with, but it is by no means unwatchable. It is fairly predictable once it gets to a certain point. In addition to a rather lackluster plot there are no moments that truly bring out a wide array of emotions from the audience. I'm sure it might be different for those who are able to identify with the star Heroine. The music in the film, while decent songs, didn't necessarily fit into the overall story. Unlike the Guardians of the Galaxy movies, the music in this film was not utilized to its full potential.
One of the last things to talk about is the directing, which was hit and miss. The directors of Captain Marvel, Anna Bolden and Ryan Fleck, are typically directors of the independent style of film and that can definitely be seen in this film. There are a few scenes where you can really get that indie feeling, and it creates a cool new dynamic that isn't typically seen in big blockbuster movies. However, the downside to the indie directors is that it is clear they don't fully know how to take action scenes to their full potential, and because of this most of the fight/action scenes tend to be a tad lackluster.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

I also don't like some of the Libertys taken by Marvel especially the insertion of the entire name of the Avengers coming from her. It's a little late in the game to have something so loosely jabbed in to the MCU. As far as my research tells me that was not ever mentioned in the comics and was made up to bolster this character.

Brie Larson, whatever you think of her, comes off as put off, bland, emotionless, and forgettable. I'm not saying Captain Marvel is forgettable, I'm just saying this isn't her best performance. Additionally, the de-aging of Nick Fury and Colson is - well, I've seen better SFX. I can't put my finger on it. Was the action scenes awesome? Sure. Is it new and fresh? I'd say no. There just wasn't a ""wow"" factor. There are blatant continuity issues that leaves me scratching my head. Would I recommend this to anyone?

Mind you, I was a bit drunk while watching the movie, and little inebriation usually makes me even more aware of such ""subtle"" life lessons.
With that said, yes - the movie had its moments of ""arent men pigs?"" with the stereotypical, yet somehow understandable inclusion of lines like ""You know why they call it the ""cockpit"", right?"", and some of the music choices came across a bit clunky (for example, using the No Doubt song at a particular moment felt somewhat ironic, considering that only the singer in the band was female), as well as some other points that just screamed ""GirlPowaaah!!!""...",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

The only redeeming factors are the performances of Sam Jackson and Ben Mendelson, who do a great job with what they have to work with. I never felt a strong tie to any of the characters except Fury and it felt like there was no weight or apprehension in the dramatic scenes. Captain Marvel never faces any intense challenge, only fighting forgettable characters who are weaker than her and it never feels like she might actually lose a fight.

She doesn't make me believe that is in her character... I always feel like she is some support (some kind of Kristen Stewart in twilight), not the main character and this drove me off, but maybe it's just me. Nick Fury was really funny and made most of the movie for me. I ignored all the media talk and feminist stuff and I judged the movie based only on the... movie, and not the external factors.

","Faster than a speeding bullet! More powerful than a locomotive! Able to leap tall buildings at a single bound! Err, wrong Universe. Well, meet MCU's newly introduced all-mighty superhero: Captain ""I am not Shazam!"" Marvel aka Carol Danvers.
Disney finally decided to include a Superman-esque type of Avenger as a secret weapon against evil Thanos, who decimated half of the Universe during ""Avengers: Infinity War"". Unfortunately, by doing so they've almost ruined the shared Universe they were building in several ways.
When You have established franchise with 20 movies in a row, scripts should be very carefully written and tied with one another or You will face a real mess for the future installments. All Carol's personal history in this movie is a retcon, a very bad storytelling practice from comics, when new elements are being re-told or tied in to existing timeline in the past (most iconic examples: long lost brothers / sisters / fathers / mothers that were long believed dead, etc).
We meet Carol in best traditions of soap operas: title heroine is suffering from strange dreams & amnesia. Main plot it is circling around personal struggle of young girl to be recognized by male colleagues / superiors as a test pilot / member of alien marine team and to find the answer to ""Who am I?"" question.
Despite the fact, that movie is about adventures of a brave young woman, film itself is afraid of everything. The story of re-capturing herself as a human being was told by small fragments, without significant development. It is hard to resist to compare Captain Marvel to Wonder Woman. Gal Gadot's character faced much wider spectrum of human feelings and thus added deepness to Diana's personality. We are not allowed to see Carol vulnerable, making hard choices (maybe, only till the end of the movie), anger - is the most widely used emotion. Even the moment of re-uniting with a friend of her was scrapped in favor of comedic reliefs. It is hard to find yourself attached to at least somebody in this film.
Writers failed to deliver decent answer to most hot question: why Captain Marvel was absent during all events of ""Avengers"" 1 / 2, ""Thor: The Dark World"" - or alien invasions were too ""small"" for Fury to call her via magic pager? Fury from all-knowing mastermind was downgraded to smart-mouth partner, who is constantly delivering jokes, even the magic about his eye patch resulted to a silly comedic feline-related scene. Remember the line ""The last time I've trusted somebody, I've lost an eye?"" from ""Winter Soldier""? Now this line looks idiotic.
The movie was promoted to mean something for feminist movement and young girls, labeled as ""masterpiece"". Unfortunately, it is not. Captain Marvel is slightly better, then Black Panther, but raises too many uncomfortable questions. For example, if movie makers were targeting diversity in the cast, why again we are looking to the story of white savior (ok, female white savior) with black friend and a black sidekick (sorry, Nickolas J. Fury!)? You know, Kamala Khan is also available as a ""Miss Marvel"". Why the story of ""evil terrorists turned refugees pursued by technologically advanced civilization"" sounds familiar (who said Muslims?).
Brie Larson's performance was not stunning just because she has not enough material to play. Samuel L. Jackson and a Goose formed a very interesting scene-stealing alliance and Jude Law formed a solid warrior character. The sad thing about Captain Marvel is number of missed opportunities: the Starforce team, acceptance of human nature, reintegration to human society - dozens of them.
I cannot imagine, how writers of the ""Avengers: Endgame"" will resolve such powerful character, as Carol Danvers (why we need Avengers, after all, if we have her?) and will resolve continuity problems without creating much worse issues.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","Hopes and high and the trailer fuelled it.

But it's clearly not the best MCU movie. It doesn't mean the movie is a flop or its a waste of money, it offers some pretty high end graphics and the humor, which is a major factor in keeping the audience focused and thrilled, really paid off. The movie slowly progresses through all the things that had happened in the life of ""Vers"", yeah that's what they call Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel. Since Carol doesn't remember anything from her past, the movie tends to reveal it through some flashes of memory Carol sees during her sleep. It well explains how a cool and stubborn pilot became the strongest character the MCU ever created. It also forced MCU to make the movie a bit more heroic and thrilling. MCU surely deserves a thumbs up for bringing out the script of the story in a well-furnished way. The movie felt a little boring for one reason : Captain Marvel can do anything from flying to plasma blasting. The only flaw in her is her inability to control her emotions which make her vulnerable and weak.

","On the surface, ""Captain Marvel"" is a surprisingly comedic action movie which has a quick pace to make every minute of its short run time enjoyable. However, when looking beyond the generic Marvel action set pieces and uneven humour, audiences uncover a plot which lacks depth and complexity, leaving many audiences uninvested in an important character within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A positive for many, though, might be the humorous approach taken by the film, not indicated by most of the marketing, with most of the humour landing, especially sequences with Goose the cat. However, unlike ""Thor: Ragnarok"", the film does not commit to its comedic tone to its fullest, and instead acts as a distraction to the generic and basic plot unfolding on screen. Also, the action scenes, similar to the humour, are very common throughout the movie. keeping audiences entertained, but once again take up screen time crucial to develop investment in Carol Danvers story. As for the narrative, it is so basic, always failing to add depth. For example, the motivations of all the characters, especially the main antagonists, is absent, with the film attempting but failing to explore potential storylines, such as the moral ambiguity of war, or explore the Kree and Skrull civilisations to their fullest. Instead the story opts to focus on 90s nostalgia and a ""buddy cop"" duo which is barely developed, while providing subversions failing to add depth, but instead brings the motivations of the characters into question even more. Overall, ""Captain Marvel"" will likely entertain a large number of movie goers with its generic action set pieces and uneven humour, but when sizing the film up with past Marvel entries, it lacks depth and creativity in its execution.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","I just wanna point it out first that I do NOT hate this movie. In fact, it has some good qualities to it. First is the acting. It's a Marvel movie of course. Would you expect anything less from the acting? Jude Law does a great job of being Yon Rogg. He presents himself as a serious leader and after the twist, he presents himself as a maniac who cares about nothing but maintaining order to Kree. And of course, Samuel Jackson does an amazing job as being his recurring Marvel role. The effects are absolutely gorgeous as well. From the Supreme intelligence, to the shots of space, to the way each power is so detailed. But, that's also the problem. This movie is so generic. When I saw it, i didn't really see what the hype was about. It was just your typical origin story like First Avenger or Iron Man 1. There was nothing new that made it cool. Black Panther was unique because it had a very sophisticated story that was about running your country and learning how to be a leader while also bringing in a social commentary in the form of a brilliant performance by Michael B. Jordan. Iron Man was unique because it was all about a war both between making weapons of war and making weapons of peace. It was intelligent, it was funny, and it was beautifully acted. Jeff Bridges did an amazing job as Stane. The point I'm trying to make here is that each Marvel movie had something to it to make it unique. Black Panther had social commentary, Infinity War had the tension and suspense, Hell, even a movie like Incredible Hulk had a great villain and that Leader ending that kept us all in question. That being said, this movie is just generic and bland. The villain is forgettable, the jokes are like any other Marvel jokes, and Brie Larson fails as being Captain Marvel. Don't get me wrong she is a good actress, but she isn't the kind of person I see when I see the most powerful heroine in the Marvel Universe. I wanna bring Stan Lee back from the dead. He'll show you how it's done. Long story short: skip this movie. You won't be missing anything if you don't see it. I wanted to give this movie a 5 Star rating, maybe even a 6.

Auto pilot super heroes who do good for the sake of good and nothing else in a two-dimensional way. A lot of marvel movies have the same problem but this one was apparent and in your face. The second thing is the characters. Brie Larson's character has no development through out the entire movie. In the beginning she is a stoic hero badass and at the end she is a stoic hero badass. There is literally no hero's gurney. I could not relate to her character because she was robotically heroic with no flaws. Compare that to another flawed movie like Captain America. That movie was flawed in the same way as this one in that the characters were heroic for no reason except for the sake of being heroes. Except one that the Captain America does well is show the development of the main character. He starts off having warriors' spirit but no warriors body. At the end he gets the warriors body and he proves to the audience that he has what it takes. In Captain Marvel, you never have a doubt that she has what it takes. So, its just bland story telling. Like this super hero is a super hero... ok... On the flip side, this movie does not deserve a 1 star because it does not fail to be a movie. So, I am giving it a 1 and a half because it fails to make me care about anything in the movie.

1. The political message is forced upon the audience and it dosen't seem natural at all. They should have toned it down a little and promote equality. At times it actually suggests that hating men is the right thing to do.
2. Nick Fury is one of the great Marvel heroes, especially because he is human and he has no super powers. Why on earth would you chose not to use him at his best? This not really fair to him, but most of all is not fair at all to the great Samuel L. Jackson.

","I came into this movie wanting to like it of course, being a marvel fan. Right from the start it kind of had a wannabe Star Trek vibe. For the first half I was confused and questioning if she was human turned Kree or Kree turned human. Clunky story telling. Then when Ronan showed up there was an obvious good guy bad guy twist and there the narrative starts. All too often movies these days want you to question who's the real bad guy? Oh, the Skrulls aren't bad, they're just misunderstood refugees. Hmmm, sounds far too familiar in our mainstream media political talking points. Now I'd read and seen reviews on this movie before seeing it and it was overbearing from those reviews that there was a far too blatant feminist message. Even that didn't outweigh the Skrull bad guy/refugee twist. I also don't think Brie Larson was right for the role. She was the most deadpan, monotone, obnoxiously sarcastic hero I've ever seen. Not exactly inspiring. With the flashbacks of all the men telling her she can't in her past...who says that? Seriously, who tells girls these put downs? Normal people don't talk like that. And if it does, it's not a male vs female thing, it's just dealing with a-holes. Everyone has to sometimes. Or bad parenting. Also, the cat was overhyped. Scene stealer? Hardly. Unexpected? Ok a little. But by far the most facepalming moment is the no doubt song during the big fight scene. I even like the song! But it was so awkwardly out of place.

He is 'Captain Marvel' despite the lawsuits and confusion from the past. Even his story for the movie coming up has changed dramatically but promises to be really entertaining and fun.

Carol Danvers- Ms. Marvel = Kara Danvers- Supergirl ??? (Hmm...I wonder about the last name part)

","Listen, it's not a bad movie, not at all. but it's not a great movie either. it's fine, it's fun, it's entertaining, but certainly does not stand out. it doesn't present anything new to the table. which is sad, because this one had to be special. and also because we all know marvel studios are capable of so MUCH MORE.
Let me elaborate, well first, the performances. Was it really that bland as alot of people predicted from the trailers? Unfortunately, yes. Brie Larson's performance was almost the worst thing about this movie. the whole time you're watching it's just her spilling out the lines, it feels emotionless and lacks any layers or depth. Though, to be fair this might be the writing's problem. Every line felt like they needed to make some sort of ""catchphrase"" out of. It felt like they were cramming the whole ""see, she's a woman, and she's capable of doing stuff"". which, in my opinion, it doesn't need to be. The movie felt like it was trying too hard to be empowering for women and all. But i would so much rather have a more consistent story line and some proper character development, instead of trying to be iconic in every frame.
after all, it's a movie, a bit forgettable, but you can still, you know, enjoy watching and get a few laughs. mid-credits scene was pretty cool though!",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","I was expecting a bit more from this. Visually the film delivers, its visuals sometimes bring to mind ""what if Terrence Malick directed a film for Marvel""... This, along with the obvious nostalgia references are what the movie delivers best. However, the musical cues are not handled so deftly, ranging from the hamfisted to the plain cringe worthy (the use of ""Come as you are"" and ""I'm just a girl"" is at best intrusive), and some scenes seem to lack a purpose or resolution (the french connection style pursuit looks like it was cut to make up for time)... Regarding the acting, Ben Mendelsohn pulls a solid performance, Brie Larson does an adequate job of the superpowered hero trope who tries to find herself and her place in the world, sometimes acting like a fish out of water (Star Trek IV, Terminator 2...), although it feels a bit wooden. One of the problems is that although ""emotionality"" is patent throughout the film, there isn't really any growth or development. Although circumstances change, the characters remain basically the same. It makes for an entertaining film, but it's not Marvel's best.

","Captain Marvel is really confusing I wanted to like the movie and I wanted it to succeed but the movie has so much writing problems when it comes to the protagonist Carol Danvers herself.
I didn't feel any connection at all. All superheroes movies need to convey consequences in their movie that's why Sam Remiey Spider-Man & Spider-Man 2 was so successful no matter what Peter did there where consequences someone got hurt,Somebody was disappointed, someone is killed. That's wants makes a superhero feel human - making mistakes. But in this movie there wasn't anything to make me feel connected with Captain Marvel. I think Bri Larson worked with the best she was given the problem is that carol is a boring character in the comics so they had to make a new character completely from scratch for this movie and that's incredible hard with only a short amount of time. The CGI in this movie is really terrible it looks so unrealistic near the end it makes her look like rubber The only fantastic.CGI was the de-again of a couple of characters but thats pretty much it.
I don't think captain marvel for a while should get a sequel at least for another two phases here's why use the avengers movies and team up movies to give her some layers I definitely don't think she should get a third movie two is good for her.

","Positives
The acting from Brie Larson and Sam Jackson is great, their chemistry was so good with buddy cop dynamic working so well. Ben Mendelsohn was so great as Talos (leader of the skrulls) delivering some of the best lines in the film. Lashanda Lynch was good as well as Danvers's best friend, she also had one of the best scenes in the film where she meets Danvers after her five-year disappearance.
The action scenes were good, my favourite being the train fight which was shown in all of the trailers. The rest of the action could have been better.
The message of the film is very inspiring, falling down only to get back up. A great message that can inspire anyone to become a hero.
The de-aged look on Sam Jackson and Clark Gregg is very good and believable. The other effects are ok and passable but I think Marvel should have raised the budget a bit higher or gotten a different VFX team for the action scenes
The score for the film was great, my favourite was when Danvers is on a mission with her team to rescue an operative as they raise from the water.
Negatives
The acting from everyone else was pretty forgettable because even the characters are so minor or the movie decides to move so fast that it forgets those characters altogether. I don't even remember everyone's name expect though the characters who I care about which was Danvers, Fury, Talos and Maria. Jude Law was ok but like other character he was forgettable.
The 90s feel was also very forgettable and was one of the main selling points to me. So disappointed that we didn't get to see more of 1995's Los Angeles because it looks so cool and the interaction with Danvers and this world was so good.
Goose, something that I thought was cute turn out to be a nightmare. The fact that it turned out to an alien and then scratched out Fury's eye was so stupid and defeat the purpose of how Fury lost his eye.
In conclusion, the film is decent in what it wants to do which is a solo character-driven action Marvel film and it does that well but I can't say that I will watch it again though.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","Yes I get it; the controversy around Brie Larson's actions surrounding the movie pushes people to not watch the film. However, if you ignore that and just watch the movie for itself, it's pretty great and not a bad film. These reviews of <4 are unjustified and extremely bias.
These claims of ""the main protagonist's weak acting ruins the entire movie"" are farfetched and untrue. I too agree with Brie Larson's acting being a bit confusing and not as strong as other characters. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to see her as a funnier lighthearted character or more a robot. SHE ALMOST NEVER MOVES HER EYEBROWS WHEN SHES HAPPY. It feel as if shes void of any human emotion even when shes telling a joke which is completely bizarre and half the time she just seems like shes a robot. A classic example of 'show don't tell'. If she had shown her emotions through her facial expressions more it wouldve made her more believable and likeable. It is so hard for the audience to connect with her when she barely acts like a human. She gets better towards the end and becomes more likeable as time goes on but still needs improvement. And the producers dont help either by giving her some absurd lines that just leaves the audience with a ""Huh?"" reaction. I hope she improves on that in the avengers.
There are so many positives throughout the movie especially Fury's conversations with Captain Marvel as they are fluid and feels like real dialogue.

I commend the creators for that, as I felt that perhaps Wonder Woman was overdone in the former aspect.

These beautifully assembled moments stand shoulder to shoulder with some of the more touching and memorable moments the MCU has to offer as a whole.

I came away from the movie not nearly as concerned with her involvement in the next Avengers and I don't think she will end up being some sort of one-woman wrecking crew that swoops in and saves the day out of nowhere, ala Dues Ex Machina, for our more established hero's.

","Samuel L. Jackson is the only reason this movie doesn't bore you to death. He completely carries the film, which takes at least 45 minutes to captivate interest. When Fury's not speaking or figuring things out in real time it is a massive cringefest that failed to avoid creating plot holes due to it being set in 1995. Captain Marvel herself seems to exist solely as a deus ex machina to defeat Thanos in Endgame, and those telling you that Brie Larson has ""presence"" should actually be telling you that she just has a massive chip on her shoulder for some reason. The only other MCU character who comes close in that regard is Dr. Strange, but remember he had his entire career and skillset that he felt defined him taken from him permanently. Carol Danvers seems pissed that the raw energy beams she can emit at will from her hands, making her one of the most powerful people in the universe, are something she has to work to control.
The plot holes: In the first Avengers movie in 2012, we're told that Nick Fury started experimenting with the Tesseract to create advanced weaponry due to Thor's arrival to New Mexico in 2011. Fury even went so far as to say that this event informed us that we weren't alone in the universe. Now we're told that Fury had the Tesseract 17 years earlier and at that same time bore witness to three alien warships who launched advanced alien weaponry at the North American continent, which would have killed millions if not for Captain Marvel. Apparently that wasn't enough of a wake up call. Also, we're led to believe that the following events did not qualify as an ""emergency"" to Nick Fury worthy of calling for Captain Marvel's help: Thor fighting a sentinel from Asgard in New Mexico, Hawkeye shooting Nick Fury and Loki taking the Tesseract before opening a portal and invading earth with an alien army, the Mandarin escalating attacks on US soil up to the point hat he kidnapped the President of the United States, Malekith landing a spaceship in London and using the Aether to attempt to enslave humanity, Hydra attempting to assassinate Fury leading to him faking his own death so that he can keep them from activating Project Insight which would kill tens/hundreds of millions, Dormammu almost swallowing Earth, and Ultron almost raising Sokovia high enough in the atmosphere to create an extinction level event. When Captain Marvel gets a rundown of the last 8 years she's going to be pissed at Fury for not activating that pager she gave him in 1995 about a dozen different times.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

7084,8 March 2019,jackjojim,4," If the Chuck Norris meme got its own movie and you were expected to relate to him as a hero
","This character alone is bad enough to drag down my opinion of the film such that the rest of the movie- cinematography, visuals, etc.- cannot save it. Unlike Captain America, Captain Marvel is not humble and friendly, someone you can easily talk to as a mentor. Unlike Iron Man or Spiderman or Thor, Captain Marvel doesn't go through any internal struggles that every person can relate to. On the contrary, all her problems come from the outside, so the blame is shifted onto others. It's fine to watch a cheesy B movie where the main heroine or hero is overpowered and just mows down enemies; however, a Marvel movie is not just some standalone movie like Die Hard, but has a connection to all other Marvel movies. So why do all the other heroines and heroes in Marvel, who learned to overcome their flaws, have to worship this new face of the MCU who's completely unrelateable as a person? Scarlet Witch should be the most powerful heroine in the entire MCU- stronger than even Thor and Dr Strange- yet she doesn't get her own movie despite having a unique, relateable personality and internal struggle. This movie is like if Tony Stark started as a genius philanthropist billionaire playboy and ended the same way. It'd make Iron Man into a cheesy movie about The Most Interesting Man In the World- an exaggerated film about a Chuck Norris meme who is only kept down by some artificial device- but not a truly heroic and inspiring one. Captain Marvel doesn't inspire humans, but is meant to be worshipped by them. If Captain Marvel was about Carol Danvers learning how to not let toxic men's opinions get to her and change her personality from one who is bothered by others to one who can overcome them, she would be a more relateable person. But she's just a symbol of pandering from a large corporation that tricks well meaning people into thinking it's a champion of human rights, instead of a soulless money making machine that bastardizes the good name of feminism to entice customers, much like how politicians trick their followers into thinking they care about humanity when they only care about power. The MCU missed its mark by not having a female led film early on, and after seeing the success of Wonder Woman, now it's overcompensating.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

There were a lot of plot twists in the film which I loved and the humor was okay there was very little of it but I feel the humor wasn't intended to make you roll on the floor laughing but they could make it better in the future. For me the tribute to Stan Lee was great and everyone at the cinema with me all clapped in his honor which showed me how great the Marvel community really is. Also the post credit scene stole the show for me and it got me even MORE hyped for Avengers:Endgame and I am surprised at the footage they showed us as I wasn't expecting that!

","It just wasn't what i was hoping for in the last movie before the entire structure of the MCU changes. Maybe the calm before the storm but, as a lead in, it felt too sub-par compared to everything else I've witnessed in the last ten years. It felt like they could've chosen anyone for Brie's role, and nothing would've changed; not to say she didn't put forth effort. This just doesn't seem right when we have so many actors who embody their roles to the point we can't view the character as being someone else. It was ok for a one time view at the matinée but I don't think I'd care to see it again. Just be better marvel, this was NOT the best you could do. Just thinking we could've gotten a Black Widow movie instead of this really gets to me. Scarlet deserves to be the titular female lead of the MCU. Sure she doesn't have OP superpowers, but she has everything it takes to lead and she's been an important part of the story since the beginning. Cpt. Marvel is forced into the story unnecessarily, and they even went so far as to redcon important plot elements built upon in the previous movies. Even Fury's story about how he got his scar was played out to be a joke due to a cat scratch. The actual first female Cpt. Marvel, Monica Rambeau, was just a non-important side character. If Brie really wanted to advocate for diversity, why didn't she suggest that the movie be about Monica, an African American woman, who was given the power first? The politics and overall underwhelming product was disappointing. I don't want to be preached to when I go see a movie, I don't want to feel like less because I am a man, and I don't want boredom most of all. This film shouldn't have happened this way. This could've reignited the character in the comics and brought it some popularity. Now it'll just end up a meme to be forgotten int the next few years.

","This movie unfortunately falls flat coming after Infinity War and leading to Endgame. While the supporting cast had great performances (Samuel Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, and Lashana Lynch), Brie Larson's performance was lackluster. Her character lacked personality and there was hardly any growth to harness and master her abilities(example: attains ability to fly out of nowhere). The final arc was a major disappointment as there was no tension or struggle between Captain Marvel and the main villain due to her suddenly becoming overpowered. The movie lacked tone and direction which led to bland line deliveries from Captain Marvel even when she slowly starts to regain her memories. The choice of music for two battle scenes(you'll know which ones) was also very questionable and felt out of place in regards to the significance and importance of the battle. The movie depended a little too much on 90s nostalgia for its humor. This movie's story does not match with the MCU and opens up plot holes that messes up the MCU timeline. This movie was placed in the wrong phase. It felt like a Phase One movie (compare it to Thor or Captain America: The First Avenger) not a Phase Three movie.

They limited the audience by being kinda feministy. Entertainment should not be mixed with politics. That just causes people to divide instead of bring them together like it should be doing. Also she has no weakness. If she's just strong she's just a boring version of superman. But superman at least has a unique personality. Oh and the fighting was so generic as well.

","Ok. I normally don't rate movies even though I like them or maybe not so much but I think I really need to address this.
Captain Marvel is not a good movie. The plot is mediocre, character development non-existent and the only reason why there i gave it 3/10 is Sam Jackson, the actor who played Talos (sorry not that good with names) and Stan Lee tribute. Brie Larson is an unlikable person and I really tried to be unbiased even considering the marketing and everything that went to this movie - I love Marvel movies with few exceptions (GoG 2, Thor Ragnarok) but I hate this toxic feminist propaganda riddled movie which, worst of all IS tacky, with physics (even comic book physics) not working (ie quinjet prototype, power transfer tesseract to the jet engine), stupid plot holes (ie goddamn flerken) and plot engineered to fit the timeline (which just doesn't work, unfortunately; ie goddamn tesseract).
I could go to a lot more detail but this movie and Brie Larson are neither worth my time. I love strong female leads, like Alita, which was an awesome movie with its own flaws, but the whole ""Captain Marvel is the strongest MCU character"" bs, which I think Feige said is just insulting to MCU as a whole and every hero portrayed in it in particular.
Real world politics and/or gender and/or race movements if not handled correctly like Black Panther have no place in comics movie and I hate that after 10 years they would do something like this.

score is forgettable and felt a bit rushed towards the end.
Bre Larson does a decent job portraying the head strong, cocky and at times witty. performance as a whole could have been better but I loved the chemestry between her and Samuel l Jackson. and are some of my favorite parts.
The supporting cast was amazing Samuel Jackson, Lashana Lynch, Ben Mendobah.
Fight scenes were creative and suspenseful though at times funny.
space battles looked great and the CGI looked fine.
The story was nothing new but done well
I'm glad they avoided certain cliches that most moves do today for example in wonder woman Gal Gado walk around like and idiot even trying on dresses for like a half hour but here the main character lands and immediately acts like the soldier she is and wants to communicate with HQ and continue her mission.
One of the first scenes in the movie which involves Carols memories shows a clever way to show us some back story of the character while showing us what kind of person she is while also progressing the story.
Is this the greatest hero movie?
not at all, but it's a good movie and I recommend watching it if your a fan of the MCU.

FOr example: the only times it felt like Carol Danvers (Brie Larson)'s character's emotions actually played a role in the story were the opening fight of the film and the final fight of the scene, and only because it was TOLD to the audience. It was not present in anyway other than the script making sure the audience knew that the screenwriters wanted this to be a main part of the movie. Not to mention, the visuals fluctuated from being great at some moments to bland and dull at others; however, an amazing selection of songs for the soundtrack of the film does the movie a lot of justice. A lot of the shakiness and room for improvement for the film may have been purely on the fact there were two directors, and it was clear at some moments as certain scenes felt like the movie was meant to have a completely different tone.

Jude Law was a terrible choice, in my opinion. It feels like he's a second hand actor, trying really intensively to still be relatable.
Every scene was predictable and some of the special effects were just embarissing for such a highly anticipated Marvel movie, which had expectations rising continously and lots of promise.

In spite of an incredible performance of both the protagonist and the other actors, the weak plot could not hold the attention as expected, the story gradually became very predictable and nauseating, of course, saving some parts as the scene in which fragments of memories of Carol were showing every time she fell into her life, the message passed behind this is really incredible, the fact they wear something as current as the female power to show that women are rising even stronger than they fell makes the film even more valued for the female audience, these are remarkable scenes that deserve even more prominence, the fact that they are brief, makes the best parts of the film seem not so important. The special effects were quite satisfactory but since some previous films have incredible scenes in relation to this, I think Captain Marvel left a little to be desired.

","""The film tells about Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel) who, during the film, tries to discover and reveal her lost memories of how she has acquired all the power she has, which is one of the greatest strengths in the film, because it keeps the attention of the viewer as he trying to understand the heroine's past through the memories that are thrown out of order during the film. Corresponding to the great expectation that a large part of the female audience expected, the film presents a strong and independent character with several scenes and lines that demonstrate the feminine empowerment, which is essential since this subject is one of the main social patterns currently, which makes the film not only a form of entertainment, but a good source of influence for young girls. Something that also pleased me was the lack of a romantic pair, which allows a greater focus on the character and her development. In general, the film follows the same formula as other Marvel films, despite innovating in the story of the heroine's origin story, yet it presents a weak and not surprising plot. Regarding visual effects and scenarios: they are satisfactory, but not the best and, in my opinion, inferior to other films, such as Black Panther. Regarding the acting act of the main actress: not bad, however, expected a little more emotion and expression in some scenes. The film is good, but it did not live up to my expectations of something different and bolder, since it is the first Marvel film to feature a female heroine and one of the most powerful and awaited by the public.""",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","In the film ""The Avengers: Infinite War"" directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, the audience was very confused because at the end of the film, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) left a help device to fall to the ground and everything indicated that a new character appeared in the cinematic universe of Marvel. Soon after appeared the film ""Captain Marvel"".
After seeing the film, I came to the conclusion that the film did not live up to my expectations because I expected more. In relation to the script I liked the way they include a comedy, but it is good that the film has a higher level of seriousness because of its history. As for the story, as the performance itself gained the powers, I thought it was a very simple way for something so powerful. I stopped to look and an interesting aspect was the way she put the empowerment of Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel), because Marvel has a habit of not revealing the true powers of women, an example is Elizabeth Olsen who played the Scarlet Witch, who in the comic it is very powerful and is not used in movies. The soundtrack does not look like much because I almost did not feel the relationship of the song with the movie, I think I should have used more. Special effects have met expectations. My conclusion is that Marvel has potential and could have taken advantage of more. I hope the movie ""The Avengers: The Last"" surpasses all expectations.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

The rest of the cast is fine as well and Jude Law few appereances feel interesting in this role. If Wonder Woman is an A or a 10, this one is a B- or a 7.

Her acting is dull, stall, automatic and deprived of personality, which compared to the acting of the rest of the cast falls behind in a massive manner (the contrast is just too notable between acting skills). The movie has no character development and barely any character growth(she never really had a true hit rock bottom moment in which she stands again gaining strength from a mistake)....Carol Danvers is the same as when she started at the end. and barely has a plot which makes this a really slow film. I don't know how the directors got the idea that we would like an emotionless invinsible and flawless woman deprived from humanity from the start to end to represent woman's feelings.

Yes we get it the 90s had blockbuster and the systems and net was slow and yet its powerful enough to broadcast a message to space (go figure that one out). The flashback scenes are really too many to count and the worst is the powers. Captain Marvel has always been sketchy in terms of super powers. In that she is all powerful and there is no apparent weakness which simply means whete is the fallibility. It's like a video game played in Easy mode. You get bored of her powers. Then there are the villians who have 70s star trek make up and DC inspired action and end up walking around in a suit with an english accent which has slang thrown in for comedy.

Over all had to see it to fill in the gaps between the first and 2nd MCU movie though frankly it added no value.

Marvel did it wrong and is experiencing a fan backlash online, and I can only hope that they will learn from their mistakes. Having said that, I now can sincerely review this title as a movie, not as an act of women fighting men and winning (of course)...
Downsides... Obviously, this flick serves as warm-up for Endgame and since it's been filmed after, the editing rush is the greatest enemy Captain Marvel has. Jumping from scene to scene happens too often and it doesn't let the plot unfold correctly. CGI has its moments, but most of the time was ""they could've done that better"".

7279,7 March 2019,Antiqua83,5," Probably Marvels weakest movie so far
","It doesn't drag the MCU through the mud but it just barely manages to come in at acceptable.
There are parts of the movie that are good, the supporting cast is fine and I really like the scenes Jackson as a young Nick Fury.
Brie Larson is ok most of the time. She comes of as a bit wooden and the quips feel forced but she isn't terrible. The main problem with the movie is that it offers very little on its own. It gives us some interesting backstory for the current state of the MCU but a Marvel movie can't just be interesting as a piece of the whole, it has to be interesting on its own as well and here is where it straight up fails. They fail to make Carol Danvers an interesting character who we care about. Both her personality and her powers come across as very generic and unimaginative and I just had a really hard time getting engaged with her throughout the movie.
There are some really in your face feminist moments in this movie as well that were slightly annoying but not as bad as many thought they would be, though to be fair I did groan a bit when the biker dude told her to smile. You can kind of tell that those bits were probably put there on request by Brie but they just come and then they go mainly without any real effect on anything of importance. They are just there to be a bit of virtue signaling basically.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","I saw the film yesterday, I enjoyed a lot of the film, the worst part about the film was literally Brie Larson's performance, unemotive, unexpressive, unmoving, and generally flat. It was funny how the movie itself literally says the criticism in the move to her and she doesn't change. That ""Smile more"" line was hilarious given the context of Brie's performance being terribly unexpressive. She can learn a thing or two from the actress that played Maria (Carol's best friend), express yourself especially when it's supposed to be emotional, they hug at the end and Brie gives the audience an incredibly flat expression and makes the scene feel just as fake as it actually is (being that it is a fictional movie), while the other actress (never learned her name) shows her emotions on her face and 'wears her heart on her sleeve,' a much more moving performance that helps the audience empathize with the character.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","It is another Marvel movie, a little bit worst than we're used to. The story is OK, nothing special. I would say Fury and Talos save the movie, they have the best scenes.
Unfortunately, the main Character isn't as good as it could be. She being rude and arrogant I can understand, it is her personality. But the problem is she's not likeable, I couldn't relate to her one second. Other character like Jessica Jones, Sherlock Holmes, and Tony Stark are pretty arrogant and we still like them.
I don't know if it is the director's fault or Brie Larson bad acting (or maybe a little bit of both), but Captain Marvel was a good movie. I hope the Character gets better in the next movies, as she will be the most powerful Avenger from now on.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","I personally like to think I tuned out the politics around the movie and I personally didn't know of Brie Larsen so I went into the movie with a fresh perspective. This movie didn't have a good structure, in my opinion it started quite well but as the movie went on it was quite a drag. Very little was done to develop the movie, for example, the war between the Kree and the Skrull, I was very disappointed with how this wasn't explored and virtually no reasons were given as to the basis for the war, the motivations of the Kree to rid the skrulls or what the skrulls may have done to piss off the Kree. I kid you not, it only takes 2 minutes to explain this, considering the plot twist later on in the movie with the Skrulls, the ideal opportunity to explain the context behind the war was at the beginning of the movie with the Kree, their motivations could have been explained further as to what the Skrulls May have done to them. They could have done this and it would not haven taken away from the plot twist.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

There are lot of problems with the film like the pacing, the story is disjointed. Brie Larsons acting is okay, Samuel l Jackson is good in the film and the rest of the cast does a good job. The humour works sometimes and sometimes it doesn't land. Captain marvel herself doesn't really have an actual flaw or character arc she is the same character she was at the start of film as she was at the end of film just more powerful. The good things about the film are nick Fury's relationship with carol danvers. How Nick Fury lost his eye is really dumb. The skrulls twist in the film was good but I wish it was explained more.

","Overall it was a fun adventure but there were just some things that were just inconsistent. The biggest issue with the movie is Carol's character doesn't really grow or change during the course of the movie. She never faces opposition she couldn't easily handle or beat, even before her powers are fully unleashed. There was no sense of threat or loss the entirety of the film. Even the ending scene where she decides she doesn't have to prove anything to Yon-Rogg doesn't hit home because it was never shown that she felt the need to prove anything to him prior. All in all it was a fun adventure and there were some good moments all around. The highlight of the film is the hilarious chemistry between Carol and Fury. Worth seeing before Infinity War, but certainly lacking in the character development department.",/review/rw4713478/?ref_=tt_urv,Captain_Marvel_2019

","This movie is okay but not on par with the rest of the series. If they want to include social commentary, then their effort is going to be evaluated, and that's mostly what this review is. Marvel is telling us what they think we want to hear but it feels disingenuous. I think the cast, including Brie Larson, is talented but the writing is lazy. Too much information in not enough time. Aside from feeling rushed, the movie is anticlimactic and has plot holes. It would have been better if Captain Marvel's introduction to the series hadn't been so abrupt or if there was another movie. Ultimately, it feels like Marvel is more focused on using this movie to progress the series rather than honoring their first woman lead and it's a little insulting. Like the writers started with the points they wanted to hit and then crammed them into Marvel's cookie cutter format. It's better than their typical white male lead, black sidekick, female romantic interest format, but falls flat in terms of entertainment value. As a role model for the kids, I liked the women in Black Panther better. This rating is a participation trophy for doing something way past due and poorly at that.

Samuel Jackson is easily the best thing in it (although he's managed to break with some elements of continuity established in Captain America: Winter Soldier).
The way the Skrulls have been depicted is _very_ different from the comics (e.g. Secret Invasion, it isn't). While I like that bit of the story and Ben Mendleson plays it very well; I like my Skrulls to be more Skrully.
Brie Larson is fine as Carol Danvers and Captain Marvel. I just find the way she becomes the super overpowered Captain Marvel to be a little weird... I mean, she's just waaay too powerful. It's a bit like why I don't like Superman - he's tooo powerful! Nothing is a real challenge if you're that powerful!
