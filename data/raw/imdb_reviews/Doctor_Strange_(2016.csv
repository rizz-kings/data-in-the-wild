","I'm not a big fan of Marvel and, in my opinion, their movies are mostly overrated. This one isn't. This is probably the second best Marvel movie, after ""Guardians of the Galaxy"". If you expect a movie to have depth and the point, you should skip, not only this one, but whole Marvel production, but if you are looking for fun you are at the right place. Visually it is amazing. I recommend watching it in theater or at least on a TV as big as possible. Standard computer monitors or, God forbid, tablets are out of question. Although 90% of this movie is pure action and fighting scenes, compared to most of the genre, story and characterization are more complete and Benedict and Tilda are excellent. Sure, like in all Marvel movies, there is a certain amount of humor and finale is one of the funniest things I have ever seen in Marvel movies. The way Strange finally defeats the enemy is at the same time unbelievably stupid, unbelievably clever and funny to tears. I gave it 8/10 within all the movies I ever watched, but within the genre, it is pure 10/10.",/review/rw3792523/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_(2016

I suppose it comes down to my belief that ""Doctor Strange"" is far more rooted in reality than many other Marvel movies. Whereas many others have storylines that audiences and humanity in general cannot exactly relate to, ""Doctor Strange"" (simply put) follows a man who loses his way. After a bad car accident, Dr. Stephen Strange finds that he is unable to continue his work as a surgeon, and essentially spirals into despair. He eventually finds salvation in the mystic arts, finally understanding that the world does not revolve around him and becoming involved in a battle to save Earth.

DOCTOR STRANGE stands out from the overcrowded market thanks to the emphasis on astral projection and spirituality, which I found generally interesting. Cumberbatch is a likeable hero and the supporting cast much better than usual for this kind of film, with Mads Mikkelsen standing out as villain.

","I think this film hugely benefits from being something at least a little different from most Marvel films. It's different in the focus that is on magic and sorcery and all of that. However, it's still quite familiar in its arc and predictable beats. The cast is fine, although nothing ever really great. Swinton manages to rise above her material, as predicted that she would. Rachel McAdams also adds a lot of heart to her character, who has a lot of screen time but who is really likable. The action sequences here are really impressive and they make a lot of the film worth it.

We have some power, ego and responsibility dilemmas, teacher-student relationships and I cant stress enough how much work went into visuals. But Doctor Strange has its downsides also.

Some movies i go to learn something from, some i go to because i want a good story, and some i go to for pure eye candy and fun. This movie is an eye candy movie. Yes there are other super hero movies with better stories but before going into doctor strange, i went for the visuals to see what they can do based on visuals i seen in the comics and to me they achieved the fantasy reality.

","I'd read some gushing reviews about this film in the press that claimed it was a masterpiece of originality, so I decided to go watch it. My gut instinct with superhero films is that if they're made by Marvel they are very formulaic and if they're made by DC they tend to be an overlong mess. This film just confirmed that I should trust my gut instinct. Benedict Cumberbatch is well cast, in fact I don't think I could quibble with any of the actors performances, but the script was a typical superhero origin film with no surprises. They gave Dr Strange spiritual powers instead of the usual ""medical experiment gone wrong""scenario, but that just added to the feeling of overall silliness about this film. Nothing in the script made me care about any of the characters and plot-wise this was an attempt at ripping off the Matrix but with magic instead of Kung fu etc. And for the umpteenth time in one of these films it ended with a big CGI fight to save the world. I mean really? Can't these people come up with anything different? The sight of Cumberbatch and the rest running around the city streets in their silly capes and LOTR style costumes was laughable. I've seen some terrible films this year, like Suicide Squad, Star Trek Beyond, Ghostbusters, Batman v Superman, Independence Day, Magnificent Seven, to name just a few.

Not only did he do well, so did Chitwel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, Mads Mikkelsen, Tilda Swinton, and Rachel McAdams. It is very rare to have the entire supporting cast in a movie play their roles to perfection. Everyone who has been in Marvel has played their roles well, but these actors did great.

","The trailer for this next entry of superheroes into the Marvel universe looked fantastic, and the critics gave it the full five out of five stars, so I definitely wasn't going to miss out, directed by Scott Derrickson (Hellraiser: Inferno, The Exorcism of Emily Rose, The Day the Earth Stood Still, Sinister). Basically in Kathmandu, Nepal, the sorcerer Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) and his zealots have entered the secret compound Kamar-Taj, which contains ancient and mystical texts, murdered the librarian, and stolen a ritual from a book belonging to sorcerer the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), he is able to escape with some of his followers. Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is an arrogant but highly qualified and acclaimed neurosurgeon, until he has a horrific car accident, he loses the use of his hands, his colleague and former lover Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) wants to help him move on, but Strange believes he can find a way to regain the use of his hands. Strange has become vain using all his resources to pursue experimental surgeries and healing processes, all without success, then he learns about Jonathan Pangborn (Benjamin Bratt), a paraplegic who mysteriously regained the ability to walk, he seeks out and is directed to Kamar-Taj. There Strange is taken in by sorcerer Karl Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor), the Ancient One was his teacher, she meets Strange and shows him her power, the astral plane and other dimensions, including the Mirror Dimension, he begs her to teach him, she eventually agrees, despite being reminded of her former student Kaecilius, who was also arrogant. Under the Ancient One and Mordo, Strange begins his tutelage, learning from ancient books in the library, now presided over by the master Wong (Benedict Wong). Strange learns Earth is protected from other dimensions by a spell formed from three buildings called Sanctums, in New York City, London and Hong Kong, the sorcerers are tasked with protecting them, but Pangborn gave up the responsibility and channelled mystical energy into walking again. Over several months Strange has advanced quickly, even secretly reading the text stolen by Kaecilius, revealed to be The Book of Cagliostro, and learning to bend time with mystical Eye of Agamotto, Mondo and Wong warn Strange against breaking the laws of nature, comparing his arrogance and yearning for power to Kaecilius. Kaecilius and his followers use the stolen pages to summon the powerful Dormammu of the Dark Dimension, where time does not exist and all can live forever, the London Sanctum is destroyed, Strange is sent to the New York Sanctum, zealots attack, Strange holds them off with the mystical Cloak of Levitation. Mordo and the Ancient One arrive, but Strange and Mordo are disillusioned when Kaecilius reveals that the Ancient One has used Dormammu's power to preserve her long life, she is mortally wounded by Kaecilius before he escapes to Hong Kong, the Ancient One tells Strange he will have to break the rules to stop the destruction, she then dies, despite the efforts of Strange and a bewildered Palmer. Arriving in Hong Kong, Strange Mondo find Wong dead and the Sanctum destroyed, and the Dark Dimension has already engulfed Earth, Strange uses the Eye to reverse time to save the Sanctum and Wong, he then travels to the Dark Dimension to confront Dormammu. Strange tries to bargain with Dormammu to end his destruction of Earth, but the evil entity kills him, however the same moment repeats, Strange reveals he has placed himself and Dormammu in an infinite time loop, they will trapped forever until he agrees to a bargain, eventually after various repeats, and Strange killed various times, Dormammu is told the time loop will end he leaves Earth, taking Kaecilius and the zealots with him. In the end Dormammu and his forces depart, Mordo also departs, disgusted by Strange and the Ancient One's disregard for the consequences of defying nature, Strange returns the Eye, also known as the Infinity Stone, then takes residence at the New York Sanctum to continue his studies. During the credits, Strange is seen meeting with Thor (Chris Hemsworth), who has brought Loki to Earth to search for their father Odin, Strange agrees to help with the search; after the credits Mordo visits Pangborn and steals his energy used for walking, stating Earth has too many sorcerers. Also starring Michael Stuhlbarg as Dr. Nicodemus West, Scott Adkins as Lucian / Strong Zealot, Meera Syal as Dr. Patel and Stan Lee as Man on Bus. Cumberbatch is the perfect choice as the leading superhero who has the career-ending accident but then becomes a powerful time travelling and wielding mystical energy, supporting cast members Swinton, Ejiofor, Mikkelsen and Wong are suited to their parts as well. This works as a fantastic origins story for the hero with the recognisable name and costume, the story is enthralling and has plenty of exciting action sequences, there are good moments of humour, but more than anything it is an excellent display of visually stunning special effects to bring superpower abilities to life and see skyscrapers and cities being rotated and turned inside out, a superb fantasy adventure and superhero movie.

","Marvel Studios has had solid success when it comes to bringing their second-tier heroes to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU): Ant-Man was a fun little heist flick and Guardians of the Galaxy is still one of the franchise's best entries to date. This multi-realm fantasy film sits comfortably in the top echelon of MCU movies thanks to its ambitious concept and dazzling set pieces, the mind-bending parallel dimensions arguably the greatest challenge Marvel Studios has set themselves yet. Director Scott Derrickson and his VFX team visualise the multiple plains of existence with jaw-dropping splendour, the Inception-esque world-shifting of the dark dimension is awe inspiring and lends itself to a superb action sequence in the final act. What the climactic battle lacks in originality – an otherworldly entity wants to destroy Earth – it makes up for in sheer visual awesomeness, with our human heroes and villains going at it whilst a recently demolished town in Hong Kong mends itself in reverse. If the action is A+ then the story is a respectable B+. The pre-powers backstory of the titular hero is mercifully brief and there is a plethora of jokes that hit the mark, however there's some clunky exposition serving as narrative shorthand and the odd bout of dire-logue that could've been cleaned up. As for Strange himself, Benedict Cumberbatch plays him with a dash of Tony Stark's arrogance, a pinch of Steve Roger's sincerity and a sprinkle of Scott Lang's what-the-hell-am-I-doing bewilderedness, all the while adding a touch of the rock 'n' roll to his brain surgeon turned sorcerer. It's a mixed bag elsewhere though, Tilda Swinton's mischievous Ancient One and Mads Mikkelsen's malevolent Kaecilius are compelling, but Rachel McAdams is given little to do as Strange's love interest Christine and Chiwetel Ejiofor is frustratingly dour as sidekick Mordo.

The first Batman with Nicholson was entertaining and funny, even the original Superman films had reasonable plots and enterainment value but Marvel and DC took the whole genre in a new direction As time has gone by, each successive superhero film reduces the human element while increasing the special effects and CGI. Doctor Strange has taken all this to a new level - I doubt if more than five minutes were filmed without using blue screens. It's sad to see the film industry deteriorate to the level where garbage like this draws huge box-office, encouraging more of the same trash to be produced. Hollywood's obsession with PC plotting and characters has lowered standards even further. The few intelligent films being produced for audiences prepared to follow a character-driven plot struggle to make a profit so we appear to be stuck with superheroes for the foreseeable future.",/review/rw3792523/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_(2016

The formula works, so why would we expect anything much to change.

I found the imagery, especially the mirror universe, initially interesting, but eventually it all began to look the same. Michael Giacchino's horn driven-music seemed out of place in a film featuring more mystic than martial heroics (and sounded too much like the theme from the current Star Treks for a film starring that franchise's 'Khan') and some parts of the film were just silly (the sentient cape comes to mind).

144,8 November 2016,ironhorse_iv,8," No doubt about it. This movie was indeed strange. I kinda like this superhero version of a kaleidoscope LSD trip!
","During the psychedelic era of the late 1960, as many hippies rejected mainstream organized religion in favor of a more personal spiritual experience, often drawing on indigenous and folk beliefs. This would also have an influence on the field of medicine, as many people seek the various practices of eastern spiritual medicine over the science of western health, during that day. In order to capitalize on that, creator Steve Ditko and Marvel Comics created 'Doctor Strange'. Inspired by old school radio adventure serials mystical programs like 'Chandu the Magician' & 'Mandrake', 'Doctor Strange' tells the story of a former neurosurgeon turn sorcerer, Doctor Stephen Strange on his quest to reclaim his broken body, while also having to protect the Earth against magical and mystical threats. The comic book character soon became very popular. So, it was no surprised that Marvel Studios would one day, bring this comic book character to live action on the big screen. However it took many years for their plans to work. The first attempt in 1978 was so badly made, that they choose to air it as a TV movie. Their next try was in 1992, with 'Doctor Morbid'. Due to the studio's license to the character expired before production has finished, the film had to change a lot from the source material. It was equally as bad as the 1978's version. The 2007's cartoon movie was alright, but it wasn't until 2016, that 'Doctor Strange' finally hit the big screen with great results. Being the fourteenth film entry of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the film directed by Scott Derrickson finally gave us, the magical spell-bounding visuals, this series needed. Remind me so much of 1999's 'The Matrix' & 2010's 'Inception' in a way. Marvel comics fans will also be pleased to see that the original Doctor Strange art by the character's co-creator, Steve Ditko, is not forgotten and paid proper respect. Kudos as well to Michael Giacchino's appropriately drug-fuel score, which helps propel the action. I also find the clever cameo from both writer Stan Lee, and the foreshadowing end credits, pitching 'Thor: Ragnarok' fun to see. However, the writing from screenwriters, Jon Spaihts and C. Robert Cargill, could need some work, as it felt a bit unbelievable in the coincidences. Like how did the 'Orb of Agamotto' get from the throne room from 2011's 'Thor' to one of the sanctums control by the Kamar-Taj? Also, the whole idea of time-travel seem a bit rush, and somewhat confusing. Another thing it's really hard to believe that Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), at first, would be, so against magic, seeking how both witchcraft, supernatural beings, and aliens, population his world in all of the Marvel movies. It's so hard to believe that the only damage, the rich selfish guy would had from a car crash is nerve damage in his hand. Anyways, while the first part feels a bit formulaic, having seen similar comic book story arches both in 2008's 'Iron Man' and 2005's 'Batman Begins', my main gripe against the film was the out of place, force humor, poorly written female characters and underdeveloped villains. Don't get me wrong, Cumberbatch is perfect choice to play Strange, as his own mixture of gravitas, but he is far from being a great comedian. Leave the jokes to somebody else. Also, it was a bit disappointment to see Rachel McAdams having nothing much to do on screen, as Strange' former lover Christine Palmer. It's sad that she wouldn't get to be the hero 'Night Nurse', since the character Claire Temple (Rosario Dawson), who appears in Marvel's Netflix television series, will seem to portray her for a very long time. Yet, the worst has to be, the misused of Mads Mikkelsen as Kaecilius. The combination of several antagonists from the comics, Kaecilius was used in the film to drive the introduction and development of bigger villains for the future, including ""certain individuals who live in other dimensions"". In other words, Mikkelsen was just a tool that was greatly underused. He is a generic, forgettable henchmen for Dr. Strange to fist-fight with. I wish, he was Kaluu, instead. I also feel that his superior, Dormammu (also played by Benedict Cumberbatch) is just as forgettable. The generic all-powerful smoke monster villain attacking Earth remind me, too much of 2007's 'Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer' & 2011's 'Green Lantern' in a bad way. I felt that all the Dormammu stuff, could had cut off, seeing how it kinda ruins the oncoming 'Infinity War' movies, seeing how one man can outsmart an all-powerful being like him. How can a normal villain like Thanos (Josh Brolin), do any better? If anything, Karl Mondo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) should had turn to the villain, faster. While, the film lacks memorable villains. The film made up with great actors for the supporting heroes in the film. Both Tilda Swinton and Chiwetel Ejiofor were wonderful as Karl Mondo and the Ancient One, even if it's a bit whitewashing. I'm for one, wasn't too angry, by the filmmakers choices that they were trying to avoid the Asian Fu Manchu stereotype. Yet, I can understand, the backlash from some audiences, of not giving one of few significant Asian roles to an Asian actor. Still, it does almost comes off as a bit paternalistic to have the educated Western man save all the mystic foreigners from their own incompetence. 'It's a damn if you do, damn if you don't' decision. Still, the movie has a positive message about humility, and not being so arrogant. In the end, it was a fun trippy movie with a lot of potential for greater things in the future.",/review/rw3792523/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_(2016

","Going on to about a dozen films or so in the Marvel Universe, there comes a point when you have to present something new to the audience. Everyone was on board with the individual films, which led to the team up of the Avengers. People were blown away with how well they pulled that off. Shift to the second phase of films and we get some decent and generic sequels. Knowing early on that they had to spice things up a bit, Marvel took a chance on some third party characters, hoping that they were unique enough to be considered ""refreshing"". So we are introduced to Guardians and Ant-Man. This seemed to hold the fans attention for a bit longer. Now were closing in on another set of films and I'm sure Marvel was asking themselves, what can we show them now? Their answer is Doctor Strange. A wonderful kaleidoscope of imagery to grab your attention, despite the same tepid story Marvel has been chugging out for years now. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, the movies are all good in my book, but I feel that the spectacle will not be the only offering people want in the next phase of films.

147,26 October 2016,Chalice_Of_Evil,8," Sherlock Holmes and Irene Adler are FINALLY reunited (sort of)...
","Benedict Cumberbatch (best known as Sherlock Holmes in the TV series Sherlock) and Rachel McAdams (Irene Adler in the Guy Ritchie Sherlock Holmes movies) play exes, Dr. Stephen Strange and Dr. Christine Palmer, who work at the same hospital. He's a successful neurosurgeon; she's a trauma doctor specializing in thoracic surgery. Cumberbatch isn't straying too far from his Sherlock role here, as his Strange is just as stubborn, arrogant and cocky as Holmes...though thankfully doesn't indulge in quite so much speed-talking. Like with his Sherlock, Cumberbatch's Stephen is not someone you are immediately meant to like. He does have a fondness/vast knowledge of music (too bad The Doors' 'People Are Strange' wasn't included), and he can toss out a quip or two, but on the whole he's kind of a jerk. However, what separates him from certain other jerky MCU characters is that his cockiness makes *sense* given how skilled a surgeon he is, and his stubbornness almost ruins his relationship with Christine, but he goes on a character's journey that teaches him humility, patience and to think of others instead of himself. We already know Cumberbatch can play an egotistical jerk to perfection, but throughout the course of the movie his Stephen actually manages to become more likable (moreso than his Sherlock Holmes) and he learns about self-sacrifice (his solution for defeating the film's 'big bad', Dormammu, is quite ingenious/hilarious).",/review/rw3792523/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_(2016

","The wild superhero action-adventure-fantasy film ""Doctor Strange"" (PG-13, 1:55) does for the Marvel Cinematic Universe what the character did for Marvel Comics when he first appeared in 1963 – make a universe into a multiverse. When Marvel artist Steve Ditko brought his idea to his Spider-Man co-creator, writer Stan Lee, according to Ditko, it was ""a new, different kind of character for variety in Marvel Comics"". The film connects Strange's new world to previous Marvel stories this way: ""Heroes like the Avengers protect the world from physical dangers. We safeguard it against more mystical threats."" The story in this vibrant and visually remarkable film starts ordinarily enough. Dr. Stephen Vincent Strange (Oscar nominee Benedict Cumberbatch) is a supremely talented neurosurgeon, with the ego to match. (Think of him as an even better, but only slightly more charming version of TV's ""House"".) He has an emotional attachment to fellow surgeon Dr. Christie Palmer (Oscar nominee Rachel McAdams), whom he respects only slightly more than rivals like Dr. Nicodemus West (the underrated Michael Stuhlbarg), whom he doesn't hesitate to publicly embarrass. Driving to a dinner, Strange's Lamborghini tumbles down a hillside and his life comes crashing down with it. Still in charge of his faculties and in possession of all his appendages, he nevertheless suffers devastating hand injuries which effectively ends his surgical career. He searches in vain for a medical solution, becoming even more self-absorbed as he does so. When Strange learns about and tracks down a man named Jonathan Pangborn (Benjamin Bratt) who completely recovered from a similarly devastating injury, Strange learns about a place of healing called Kamar-Taj, near Katmandu, Nepal, and literally spends his last dollar to get himself there.",/review/rw3792523/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_(2016

Seeking only to fix his hands Stephen reluctantly gets dragged into a mystic battle, when a renegade Sorcerer threatens to combine their realm with another one ruled by the dark overlord Dormammu. This is a movie that feels like just ecstatic alone its feels like one of the most ambiguous comic book Films. The MCU succeeded in bringing the Avengers to the big screen. The films played it safe for the most part and kept the Action to Earth. Then Guardians of the Galaxy came out and it took us to the Stars, to explore other planets. While Thor hinted at the magic it wasn't really in tune with the rest of the Film. Doctor Strange gives that mystic wonderous it an all-around entertaining film that is a visual spectacle that does justice by viewing on a large screen. In taking clear inspiration from both the 70s comics and films like inception with the mirror dimension. It showcases various abstract imagery and psychedelic colors. The cast all do a good job. Benedict Cumberbatch of course as Strange much Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark is a spitting image of the character. He's arrogant and self-righteous, egotistic. He's a jerk, yet a good guy, and in many ways is very charming. I also like the connection between him and Mordo, the whole student mentor concept is handled well. In many ways, you can see the contradiction between the two of them. Wong is awesome he gets some funny moments. Tilda Swinton has one the lesser impact on the film, Yeah unfortunately she's not a Tibetan old man, but she does get some moments in the film. It just feels like there should have been focus given to her with her connection with Mardo and Kaecilius and being the one to push Stephen into the role as the Sorcerer Supreme. Same with Mads Mikkelsen he's a great actor and has played serious villains before in other things. Le Chiffre from Casino Royale and Hannibal from the tv series. Kaecilius is a very bland and generic villain much like a lot of the villains in the MCU. He would have worked better on the side while Dormammu was more in the spotlight.

Stephen must surrender to not knowing anything. Only then, can he begin to reclaim his power and his life. This is an awesome surprise. Director Scott Derrickson's ""Doctor Strange"" is about transformation in the guise of an action movie, done with a sense of humor. Cumberbatch's Strange invents himself when the old definition of himself no longer works, and in fact is killing him. This invention is perhaps, the most noble of human pursuits. Capturing the poignancy with a sense of humor and ""Beyonce'"" jokes possesses an enlightened sensibility. ""Doctor Strange"" aspires for the heavens and never takes itself too seriously.

","""Dr. Strange"" ranks as the best Walt Disney Studios and Marvel Comics' collaboration since ""Iron Man."" Mind you, I've confined myself strictly to the Disney/Marvel franchise and excluded the Marvel Comics/Twentieth Century Fox franchises: ""X-Men,"" ""Deadpool,"" and ""Daredevil."" Not only is director Scott Derrickson's sixth movie a dazzling example of bizarre superhero histrionics, but it also qualifies as a splendid origins epic in every respect. Wisely, Derrickson confines this supernatural masterpiece to 115 minutes without slighting any character or leaving any threads undone in its formulaic template. Benedict Cumberbatch is truly a revelation as Dr. Steven Strange, and his character follows quite an arc before the film concludes. Audiences should know that ""Dr. Strange"" has two scenes before and after the end credits that are essential to the film. Steven Strange possesses an abrasive attitude, and ""Dr. Strange"" adheres to the Disney/Marvel formula that originated with ""Iron Man."" Dr. Strange is just as arrogant as Tony Stark. These two prima donnas begin as ordinary humans with extraordinary gifts before hubris and bad luck combine to topple them from affluence. Similarly, they recover from these seemingly insurmountable ordeals with the incentive of a powerful mentor and emerge as larger-than-life titans. Unlike the colossal collateral damage that has highlighted virtually every Disney/Marvel movie to date, ""Dr. Strange"" embraces an alternate strategy. This movie eschews the real world and lapses more often into the imaginary realm. The heroes don't destroy cities in their efforts to subjugate the villains as they have usually done in previous Disney/Marvel extravaganzas. Furthermore, Derrickson channels ""The Matrix"" in the depiction of Dr. Strange's makeover as he learns about how to exist in different dimensions. Meantime, in its biggest departure from the Marvel comic book series, Derrickson and company have broken a tradition. They have cast Oscar winning actress Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One who introduces Strange to the wondrous mysteries of the mind. In the comics, the Ancient One was a guy rather than a girl.

210,31 January 2017,mounirrmaged,2," An overrated, generic marvel movie
","Doctor Strange is the latest installment in the marvel cinematic universe franchise and it is directed by Scott Derrickson (sinister, deliver us from evil). The story follows Stephen Strange, the top neurosurgeon who loses the ability to use his hands after a car accident and his quest for spiritual healing from the help of mystic arts. Much like most marvel movies, the plot of the film is thin and doesn't have much to tell. It follows the simplest form of film making without taking any creative risks or new ideas. The moving point starts at the tenth minute of the movie, the car accident. This is incredibly rushed because barely anything is known about the main character except that he is egotistical and a great doctor. The films gives no detailed insight about his humanity or how he interacts with the real world or how his life is. Nothing of that is given in the film, which weakens it. How is the audience supposed to emphasize with a character that was poorly built from the get go? And it doesn't stop here, the character is basically Tony Stark 2.0 but instead of the armor, he uses magic. Benedict Cumberbatch gives his best to breathe life in Stephen Strange, but the performance falls flat due to the weak script. The only charisma he has are the quips and jokes, which become tiresome really fast. The lack of any dramatic tension or internal conflict makes the character barely 3 dimensional. Stephen does change by the end of the movie, but it feels unearned. This film could have been a unique entry in the superhero genre due to its subject matter: a pure fantasy world filled with magic and other bizarre worlds. But, much like Thor (2011), all of this creativity is overthrown for the sake of decently conceptualized visuals and a generic story that offers no new perspective. The villain in the movie, while not as terrible as the mandarin or other bad mcu villains, is not great either. A mediocre villain with your typical, generic motivations. The film implies a conflicted past between Kaecilius and the Ancient One, but it is not explored. Just as the rest of mcu movies, Doctor Strange has no memorable musical score, and it barely even services the movie well. It doesn't add any form of weight or emotional levity. It is extremely superficial and used only as a tool to make the scenes less awkward or make it funny. Marvel is abusing the solo movies as well as the directors and audiences by giving movies whose sole purpose is to build up to future franchises. The one thing that was truly good was the visuals, which was not mind blowing as people say.

","Dr. Strange (RATING: ☆☆☆☆½ out of 5)  THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.   IN BRIEF: Stunning visuals elevate a good film to an excellent one.   GRADE: B+  SYNOPSIS: After a serious accident, an arrogant surgeon discovers a  much greater power on his road to recovery.  JIM'S REVIEW: Trippy! Far-out! Rad! Cool, dude! These dated expressions  of awe serve a purpose in describing the latest heady concoction known  from the Marvel factory, Dr. Strange.  Fate creates the man...the man being Dr. Stephen Strange (played to the  hilt by Benjamin Cumberbatch). Strange is an egotistical gifted surgeon  who befalls a serious car accident and seeks help on a more mystical  bent. Traveling to Nepal he meets Mordo, a trusty guide on his road to  find out. (Chiwetel Ejiofor, another talented actor who deserves a more  challenging role but still offers much class to his role.) Our hero  eventually connects with The Ancient One (a racially miscast but quite  enjoyable Tilda Swinton) for enlightenment of the mystic kind. This  oracle shows him the ins and outs of magic and healing while imparting  him superpowers and mind-game control (plus a nifty Cloak of  Levitation) to fight evil forces (with the help of terrific  state-of-the-art CGI).  Our superhero's journey to self-discovery takes over the majority of  the screen time before he does fly into kung-fu combat, as most Marvel  heroes do, following the formula of most action fantasies. His nemesis  is a worthy villain, Kaecilius (nicely played by Mads Mikkelsen), a  convert of The Ancient One who has conveniently gone off to the dark  side. The screenplay by C. Robert Cargill, Jon Spaihts, and the  director tries to keep predictability at a minimum and doesn't always  succeed, but he does develop his characters well with enough depth  without sacrificing the adrenaline rush that we has been accustomed to  expect from this genre.  While the film is continually creative and imaginative, it lacks some  originality in its story and visuals, owing other sci-fi predecessors,  specifically The Matrix Trilogy and Inception, big time, but director  Scott Derrickson masters his film's visuals astutely. There is much  eye-candy to behold and the action is non-stop thrilling. Probably no  more spectacular than a memorable soon-to-be-classic set piece  involving mirror images and buildings that effortlessly folding under  each other. This phantasmagorical origami lesson is a kaleidoscopic  marvel of CGI inventiveness. (M.C. Escher would be proud of this visual  op art of suspended architecture and other worldly structures on the  move. Even Hieronymus Bosch would smile wryly at the surrealism hinted  at elsewhere on display. The look of the film is truly a thing of  beauty. (See this movie in the IMAX 3-D format, if possible, for total  immersion.)  Benedict Wong and Rachel MacAdams offer fine support in minor roles.  But it is the strong production values that had this moviegoer  transfixed throughout this blockbuster pop entertainment spectacle. The  film is a remarkable technological achievement, a instant classic and  one of the best comic book superhero films ever. It wisely allows  strong character development, a clever narrative, and stunning action  sequences to merge effortlessly.  Marvel Studio's Dr. Strange does live up to its moniker. It is just  that...strangely hypnotic and a visceral marvel. Go see it.",/review/rw3792523/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_(2016

","An egotistical, world-renowned surgeon loses feeling in his hands and must search for meaning in what's left of his life. Seems like a fairly easy, if overdone, template for the next chapter in Marvel's sprawling cinematic universe. Yet, strangely (har har), there's very little character progression and the doctor's personal arc falls thoroughly flat. Following a brief stumble through his rolodex of former colleagues and a very short humbling at the hands of spiritual masters, Strange makes no personal advancement. He merely shifts from being the world's greatest surgeon to its resident sorcerer supreme. No penance, no spiritual enlightening, just a short rocky patch in his perfect life and then a nearly-immediate gratification. Shallow character development among the supporting cast, particularly in Mads Mikkelsen's villainous foil (underdeveloped rivals being a dirty habit in the MCU), doesn't provide the crutch that might have smoothed things over somewhat. The effects work is dazzling and creative, providing much more than we saw in the trailers, but that's really the only draw here.

Some of you know, that this is my most anticipated film of the year. I've watched the trailers so many times that I probably know them off by heart. Firstly the acting was spot on, Benedict Cumberbatch literally became his character and his American accent was perfect. Tilda Swinton, Rachel McAdams and even the underrated Mads Mikkelsen were all great, I've not seen such a perfect cast for a superhero film. Director Scott Derrickson (who also directed the horrors Sinister and the underrated Deliver Us From Evil) is confident taking on a franchise movie and is particularly interesting to see how he has transitioned so well from horror to fantasy. The visual effects are outstanding, obviously this film will remind people of Inception, but what this film was able to achieve was such a high level of imagination and technical excellence that really takes the viewer into the world on the screen. There is one great scene that reminded me of MC Escher where the camera pans around and creates the illusion of an isometric view, mind you that whole act was great. The script was funny and witty which is what one would expect from a Marvel studio film, we have to remember that this behemoth of a studio know exactly what they are doing now and can make origin films constantly. That is where the problem lies. This film is so formulaic that it borderlines on boring, I literally at a point wanted this film to get going and do something different but alas it did not. One of my friends told me ""if it isn't broken, don't fix it"" in which to my reply was ""it will eventually get broken if something doesn't change"". Some of the visual effects for the humans during fight scenes were done poorly and did take me out of the film slightly. The villain played by Mads Mikkelsen was weak and once again forgettable which really irritated me because he is such a waste of talent on this, why can't these films have better villains? (I shan't spoil it but there is another villain in which I did not like this interpretation of). Also a lot of the fight scenes were choppily edited and filmed which was a shame. Overall, Doctor Strange will satisfy fans with its great cast, witty script and sublime VFX but ultimately it's just another formulaic origin story that borderlines on boring.

","The Marvel Cinematic Universe can easily be divided into two categories - the Sci-Fi/fantasy movies (like Guardians and Thor), and the more earth-based/thrillers (like Iron Man and Captain America). It seems like everyone has one side of it that they prefer. Personally, I'm into the Sci-Fi/fantasy movies, which is one of the main reasons why Doctor Strange is my favorite MCU movie. I know it's not one of the more popular Marvel movies, and my love of it is very personal. I'm fascinated by magic, mysticism, out of body experiences, alternate dimensions, all that good stuff.

The story is actually really strong and it flows really nicely, my only problem may be the villains real motive as it's a bit hazy but nothing that is so glaringly obvious. The characters actual aren't to strong besides doctor strange. The rest have meaning for being there but don't really add much. Doctor Strange does however have a clear and linear progression, clearly showing his development throughout the story which is excellent to watch. There is a lot of foreshadowing that I never noticed before, which is nice to notice. The main viewing experience however is the special effects. The scenes are trippy as hell and are just baffling to look at, it honestly looks incredible and with magic powers really comes no limitations with fight sequences as shown in the movie. This leads to never before seen fights and a crazy ending battle. The movie never drags either, it has a constant rhythm (with a dash of repetition) that allows for an easy watch.

","Marvel's Doctor Strange is a visual feast of magical fantasy in the vein of Harry Potter & Aladdin. While its tone is in-line with the larger MCU, its style stands-out from its decidedly similar counterparts. With trippy universe traveling and Inception-on-steroids world bending, it's one of the few superhero entries in recent years whose giant scope is fitting, whose immense danger is understandable, and whose convoluted mythos works. In a make-believe world without boundaries, Doctor Strange runs with gleeful and refreshing abandon. Plot-wise, it has all the familiar origin-story beats: everyday genius discovers powers, his disbelief eventually gives way to the truth, initially struggles with powers, realizes he has inexplicable skill ""inside him"", and then uses his powers for sacrificial good. Its strength, as is the case with most MCU films, is its bright character and small moments of humanity. Strange starts as an intentionally less-charming Tony Stark before becoming a less dense Thor-like hero, surrounded by spiritual gurus, ageless sages, villainous space-jumpers and character-enhanced capes. It would be easy to allow overt piety to overwhelm the screen, but that is sidestepped nicely with great humor that plays with the intersection between normal reality and spiritual reality. That balance isn't always struck perfectly, however. Early on, there are too many strange tonal shifts and some pace-halting exposition that get in the way. Even the larger visual greatness is stunted at times in the frantic and hard-to-follow combat scenes. However, it's still a popcorn-fueled mind-bender that is (at worst) a middle-of-the-road Marvel film, which still puts it way above most blockbusters these days.",/review/rw3792523/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_(2016

","I am a Marvel reader from the 60's, my youngest son is also into the Marvel movies. We had been talking for a good 4 years or so about when they could crank out a Dr. Strange, one of my favorite titles from the 60s. So they finally did it and it wasn't a total disappointment even for a perfectionist like me. Marvel is always spot on in casting, no exception whatsoever with Cumberbatch as the charming but arrogant Dr. Strange. I wasn't as hot on their choice for the Ancient One (male , older, and more passive in the comics), that was a bust. What made Dr. Strange so great was 1) Ditko's drawing of the spells and counterspells, and 2) the strange devices and spells the sorcerers used. So to my list of issues: the first and biggest is the fighting, in the comics it was spells/counterspells, they do a little of that here but it is more ninja stuff. That was my biggest disappointment. Beyond that, my concerns were - Dormammu was one of the scariest villains in comics (flaming head), here they trotted out just another scary face; they played too many plot cards, they could have saved some stuff for the next movie (like Dormammu); and it doesn't always have to be the end of the world. Marvel seems to be gravitating towards putting the entire world at risk, that gets old when it's too often and it isn't needed. If they cleaned this up and worked on the spells more the sequel to this could be a great movie, they've set the table okay. But it could just as easily flop, I'm keeping my fingers crossed.",/review/rw3792523/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_(2016

","I love the MCU not since Phase One have I disliked a single movie that they've produced and Doctor Strange is one of their finest. Now I love the Captain America and Thor franchises but I've always liked seeing them introducing new characters into the mix and this is with a doubt their most ambitious movie since The Avengers. This movie is truly different from anything else we've seen in this universe and I loved that about this movie. The magic in this movie truly brought something new it made for some incredible, jaw- dropping visuals that convinced you of the power of these people. Benedict Cumberbatch was perfect for this role not only does he have a (surprisingly) convincing American accent but he's also able to bring his charm and wit to the role that makes him a much more human protagonist. Rachel McAdams was really good in this movie she's in it just the right amount and had some really great chemistry with Cumberbatch that made it all the more sad to see him fall apart. Chiwetel Ejiofor has truly become one of my favourite actors he was great in this film and I liked that they took their time set him up in this movie and I truly cannot wait to see him again. Tilda Swinton proved all the haters wrong in this movie she was great and coming across as wise and intelligent and hit just the right note of intrigue. By far the most common complaint among Marvel movies are the villains but I really think they nailed it here with Mads Mikkelsons character. Not only did I love the design of the character but also his motivations were somewhat understandable and in a way you can see where he's coming from. The magic in this movie is truly amazing they use it in practical ways that further proves that Marvel can take anything from their comics and make it work on screen. The movie does suffer from its conventional telling of an origin story and makes you realise that we've seen the structure before which is a shame considering the great lengths they took to establish a different kind of world with this movie.

Nothing feels phoned in and everything feels just right- whether its the amazing visuals and cinematography throughout, the excellent cast and performances, or its ability to create such grand wonderland worldbuilding throughout that Marvel has never yet captured the brilliance of quite as much in their later more recent films. A lot of this is due to director and co-writer Scott Derrickson- who easily shapes the film to the best of its abilities and potential. Derrickson is just the perfect storyteller throughout, making such an insane concept believable and allowing its audience to care so much for it throughout its longer runtime. Before I even realized it, the film was over, and I immediately wanted to see more from this world and the character of Strange himself. Cumberbatch is the absolutely perfect fit for this role, honestly trumping Robert Downey Jr.'s casting as Iron Man in my personal opinion for the most perfect fit in the MCU. I also enjoyed the supporting performances from B. D. Wong and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen were never fantastic, but did both give their most into the roles provided, and made for some very entertaining and very memorable moments. In the end, Doctor Strange is one of Marvel's best- capturing worldbuilding at its finest and perfectly helmed by the likes of Derrickson behind the camera and Cumberbatch in front of it.

No Tony Stark or Thor (except for the post-credits scene, but that's a little different), just Stephen Strange and his world. The casting is also very good. Benedict Cumberbatch provides a very convincingly arrogant and privileged guy who realized he might be wrong after all by the time the movie is coming to a close. He's still flawed, but at least he's trying.. There was only a small handful of things that could have been improved. The pacing started out a little odd. I feel like it could have taken more time to develop all of the characters and their world. It did even out quickly, though. Again, a bit of a generic villain, but Kacaelius was not as threatening as he could have been. I don't think it was as bad as most people say however.

","*I am not a native speaker, so i am sorry for mistakes or things like that.* I was very excited about the doctor strange movie. I never read a Marvel Comic so I had no idea what to expect. What I expect was a generic marvel movie with magic instead of ""avengers power"", I can promise that it is much more than that. The first 5 minutes of the Movie destroyed my prejudices. I was drawn into the world of Doctor Strange. Doctor Strange surprised with a comparatively slow narration. Our Hero doesn't get his skills at the next road corner after 10 Minutes. So we follow him on a interesting journey through the mind of a person that changes completely. The slow beginning of the story is followed by a short middle section, which is my only criticism of the film. The story does not get a ""routine"" and starts immediately with events which advance the story further. So the learning process is a little bit too quick for my taste. There is no real middle section of the movie. With 115 Minutes the movie is comparatively short compared to movies like Civil War or Batman v Superman and I would have preferred if the film had gone a little longer. So the Story of Doctor Strange is interesting and the setting is unused. The whole movie feels refreshing next to the other ""classic"" marvel films, a little bit like Deadpool (Really only a very very small bit like ""Deadpool""). The visuals of the Movie are stunning. It is absolute amazing to sink into the world of mirror dimensions and things like that. I would advise anyone to watch this movie in the cinema AND in 3D. I think this is the first time since ""Avatar"" that I would prefer a movie in 3D, but the optical illusions and changing dimensions are absolutely amazing in 3D. The music is good but inconspicuous, nothing centuries long lasting, but good and fitting. Benedict Cumberbatch convinces like the rest of the cast of the film. I haven't read the comics, but for me Tilda Swinton was a great embodiment of her role. I can't understand the debate of here role.The humor is similar to the other Marvel films, apart from Deadpool (this movie was glorious). The last thing I want to speak about is the overlaps with the Movie ""Inception"" some people talked about in advance. Doctor Strange is not Inception, some people will remember the optics to inception, but Inception and Doctor Strange are like apple and pear. I think it is a matter of attitude. So don't expect something like Inception and you will not be disappointed. So what we have is a real interesting character, stunning visuals and refreshing setting packed in a very good movie. If you are interested in the Marvel universe it is a very good episode. If you never watched a Marvel movie before (if there is a person in the world) it is a perfect beginning to give this sort of movie a chance. I give this Movie 9 out of 10, 8,5 out of 10 if i could.. Thumbs up Marvel I am very excited about the future of your universe. Thanks for reading.",/review/rw3792523/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_(2016

","Doctor Strange, directed by Scott Derrickson, throws us Marvel fans a complete curve ball, with his execution and style, but it paid off well! With Doctor Strange having a tough back story to sculpt into frame, Derrickson and the creative team made the best out of it, creating this inventive, mind bending film, with so many twist and turns, while involving new and creative ideas. Sadly, the biggest issue of the film, is the story. This, by the numbers premise, has been used and abused many times by the MCU. Derrickson created some great potential for a new world building opportunity, with a pace that doesn't have a lot of downtime to play around, but because of the clunky scene structure, choppy pace, and surplus of exposition, a lot of events and characters went underdeveloped; If this film was another fifteen minutes longer, it would've allowed for developing in their weak spots.

","With a lot of superhero movies that came out in the past with the hero fighting against villain or villains. They needed to bring something new to the genre to keep things a bit fresh. And ""Doctor Strange"" is the film the Marvel Cinematic Universe needed to bring to the table. While past good or even great superheroes movies delved into science fiction and Norse Mythology. It is for the most part grounded in reality despite other worlds and superpowers that is already set and predictable. Now it delves into altering reality and time by using mystical arts. Even going into astral and multiple dimensions. I wasn't sure what to think of this movie when I first saw the trailer. Because I usually found magic to be pretty boring in comic books because there really isn't a set of laws and there isn't any boundaries. So the possibilities are endless. Which can lead the hero or the villain to just use magic in just about every circumstances to overcome or avoid a conflict. Thankfully this film cleverly constructed it to make it seem like the heroes were actually in jeopardy. And added stakes to the conflict the character Doctor Strange must adapt and grow wiser and selfless in order to conquer. By washing away parts of his arrogance, selfishness and cynicism. But even in the beginning with those traits he did came off a charismatic and even sort of magnetic. Because of Benedict Cumberbatch's performance, because he is such a likable actor. He was hesitant about taking on this role but I am glad he did. Plus a lot of doctors have a bit of a god complex because of their profession anyways. When it comes to the special effects, CGI and action sequences it nothing like I have ever seen before. I mean I have seen some aspects of it, but not like this. What makes the action sequences stand out in this, isn't just the mind bending kaleidoscope like settings but it's clever choreography and execution. When it comes to the plot, it is a bit of a generic superhero origin story but that didn't take away much from the experience. Although I would have wanted more depth to Doctor Strange's downfall of the pain and turmoil he has to go through. So when he is able to rise, there would be a bit more impact to it. Plus I also though the training aspect of the plot was a bit glossed over. But I guess that was to quickly get to the superhero elements because they were on a budget after all. To sum up the plot, it's a mix of The Matrix, Iron Man, Inception, Kung Fu Panda and Alice Through the Looking Glass. I personally think it's okay to borrow elements from other movies as long as at it's core it does have it's own originality. And for the most part this does have it's own flare to it and it's own unique elements at it's core.

","Benedict Cumberbatch who plays the main role of Dr Strange stars as the head strong, pompous neurosurgeon whose personal adversity leads him to join a legion of sorcerers and to learn the inner most details of the universe. He perfectly plays a man who develops from being overly cocky to being smart with his skills and knowledge, the tragedy that shocks the audience actually turns out to be exactly what he needs in his life as he learns to be humble and have humility. The film had me hooked from the beginning, this was done brilliantly by the director Scott Derickson who has included and thought of every variable possible to keep the audience hooked and on the edge of their seat in every scene in the film, even the scene where you are just literally looking through a door to see where he come through the portal. Furthermore, there is a lot of cracking shots in the film, especially the scene in which Cumberbatch and Swinton are having a conversation while lighting strikes illuminate the sky and reveal the drifting snow in the wind. Now in every Marvel film there is always the balance of Superheroness and comedy, and this is still evident in Dr Strange through the satirical humour that Dr Strange uses as well as the subtle humour and obvious humour. Furthermore, the CGI used in this was exceptional, bending buildings and folding streets, I didn't initially notice any problems with the green screen but I've heard from others that in some areas it has been a bit hazy and lacking in quality but I never noticed it.

The Ancient One's students and humanity at large is threatened by Kaecilius (Mikkelsen), a former pupil who went rogue and is meddling in dark powers that could doom humanity. As Strange's colleague and ex-girlfriend Dr. Christine Palmer (McAdams) comes to terms with his transformation, Strange must use his newfound abilities to defeat Kaecilius and his followers.

With his job in the medical field, he travels to a mysterious world overseas known as Kamar-Taj in hopes of finding a treatment to restore his usage in his hands.

Benedict CumberBatch shines as a brilliant surgeon who is humbled after a tragic accident.Without spoiling the plot, He goes on a mission to regain his lost talents. Eventually Strange finds his true calling as a Sorcerer, and changes his life forever. This film has some of the best visual representation of plot events that I've ever seen. The reality bending action scenes showcase outstanding cinematography and realistic choreography. Shots are edited in a uniquely frantic matter during each fighting scene. The plot was decent overall, but it borrows heavily from previous superhero origin movies like Iron Man and Batman Begins.

393,4 November 2016,Lewis_Heather787,6," A bit disappointing from all the hype!
","Ever since the name drop in Captain America Winter soldier , i thought Doctor Strange must be someone rather important and amazing. I'll get onto whether he is as important or interesting as it was made out.Just as a side note I'd never heard of Doctor Strange until Winter soldier and I'd never seen any of his comics so I have no prior knowledge about the character, my fault I'm more a DC fan than Marvel. Oh no that must mean that i hate every Marvel film and love every DC film, no not true. Onto the positives of the film, firstly the effects in the film are breath taking and a truly stunning. This film will probably suffer with the tag of ""copying"" the film Inception but I feel this brings something new to the table and is slightly different from Inception. Every action scene in the film has effects that every film should strive to have because they are mind blowing....(pun intended). The other positive I have is the cast for the most part was solid, with the Standouts being Benedict Cumberbatch, Tilda Swinton and Chiwetel Ejiofor. They all gave performances that were decent for the film but nothing amazing but it didn't need to be anything over the top. Unfortunately this is the part where I get called a Marvel hater and DC fan boy, there are negatives to this film....quite a few. Firstly although the performances are good in the film I didn't care for any of the characters in the film, even Strange himself who is a horrible person. It made it difficult for me to follow the characters through the story. Next the story, as I said earlier I don't know the original story or any story of Doctor Strange so I could be completely wrong, but my word was it a boring story. I had no interest in following Strange around the world in his training or life, the only saving grace are the effects to keep me engaged. If that is happening then the film has missed its mark with myself. Next negative and the main negative I have with every Marvel film....Humour, once again there is too much of it. Personally just ruins the scene and the experience for me and there generally not funny either. Lastly the villain, which similarly to every other Marvel film except Winter Soldier is very weak. This is such a shame considering you have a great actor in Mads Mikkelsen, but in this film I never saw him as a genuine threat. I believe that Doctor Strange would work far better in a ""avengers"" type film I think this time Marvel bit off more than they could chew. This is a real shame from a COMIC BOOK FAN that this has happened, and that this year has turned out to be a generally poor year for comic book films. Lastly was Doctor strange an important addition to the MCU, in my opinion no not really but OK. Also was he as interesting as I thought, erm...no not really either which is a really shame. 6/10 or 60% its OK nothing amazing or bad just a bit boring, only the effects saving it!",/review/rw3792523/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_(2016

If for nothing else, Doctor Strange is worth seeing just for these mind-blowing, incredible special effects that I'm convinced will not only be nominated for an Oscar, but will by far win it. The creativity of the team behind this film shines through its technical brilliance. Not only did they continuously top themselves scene after scene with the level of complication behind these visual feats, but they found ingenious ways to incorporate these effects into the hand-to-hand combat. You could tell every big action set piece was incredibly well thought out and orchestrated. The action is also something we've never seen before, especially in any of the other Marvel movies.

","""Dr. Steven Strange"" (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a highly competent neurosurgeon who has an ego that is only matched by his arrogance and basic lack of charm. But that all changes one day after a car accident causes massive damage to his hands which essentially destroys his ability to function effectively in his chosen career. So having limited success with everything that Western medicine has to offer, he travels to India in a desperate search for a holistic remedy. But when he gets there and meets with an elderly woman known as ""the Ancient One"" (Tilda Swinton) he discovers more than he ever thought imaginable. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I had looked forward to watching this movie for a long time and now that I have finally gotten around to it I must confess that I was somewhat disappointed. To be sure, this film was better in some ways than the 1978 version--if for no other reason than the improved CGI. Unfortunately, rather than concentrating on creating a film with any measure of depth, the director (Scott Derrickson) chose to take the rather lazy and uninspired route by providing--yet another--superhero film consisting of nothing but action and CGI. Make no mistake, a film of this type definitely needs CGI and action. But it shouldn't be at the expense of everything else. That said, although I don't consider this movie to be bad necessarily, I also don't believe that it achieved its considerable potential either. For that reason I have rated this film accordingly.

","I must confess that before watching this movie, I had next to no prior knowledge of the comic book character Doctor Strange. So I don't know how closely this cinematic adaptation is to the source material. But I can confidently report that much of the movie plays out in a way that has elements that I have seen in many other movies before, superhero oriented or not. For example, the characters seem very familiar for the most part, such as a central protagonist who starts off selfish and arrogant but ultimately redeems himself. The villains are stereotypically flat, with no complex attributes or deep looks into their minds. And the central story's twists and turns will not be very surprising for most viewers. Oh, there are some good things here and there. The special effects are good at times, the action a few times is eye-catching, and the movie is never downright boring. But all the same, the movie feels kind of tired and lacks serious ability to give the audience something new and fresh. It's certainly better than watching a blank wall for two hourse, but not that much more.

","Thanks to some interesting visuals and a couple of fantastic action sequences, 'Doctor Strange (2016)' is a solid, if broadly generic, origin story that sets up an interesting new hero and gives him one of the widest (though somewhat 'Tony Stark') character arcs in recent MCU history. It sometimes tries too hard to be funny, with a couple of moments being unfortunately undercut by some poorly timed humour. This isn't a major issue, however, as most of the comedy comes from character and fits with the flick's consistent tone. The lead character is initially hard to sympathise with, especially since the accident that kicks off the plot is entirely his fault, but his journey and general charisma ultimately make up for that, even if his transition from 'muggle' to 'magician' is kind of hazy in terms of how long it takes. The piece is actually highly enjoyable throughout and takes a number of risks that more than pay off, especially with its wacky visuals that are a real treat to watch unfold. It also keeps a keen focus on its characters, which is what makes its fight sequences work so well, and has a hold on its themes, too. Overall, though we've essentially seen it before (mystic arts notwithstanding), this is an entertaining and engaging picture that sits comfortably among Marvel's better efforts. 7/10",/review/rw3792523/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_(2016

","Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) has a big problem with egomania. A top neurosurgeon in NYC, he does work miracles but, his ego is enormous. Needless to say, his attitude prevents others from liking him, including another surgeon, Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) who the doctor seems to admire. Yet, pride goes before a fall, as they say. One fateful night, Strange drives too fast in his hot sports car, while talking on the phone, and he crashes. It's horrendous. Yes, he's alive, but his hands are badly damaged and to a surgeon, that's the universe. After extensive physical therapy, his hands remain shaky. Desperate, he learns that a paralyzed man now walks again, after a trip to Nepal. With his finances extremely low, Dr. Stephen nevertheless takes the trip to the faraway land, searching for The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton). He almost doesn't make it until he is saved on the street by Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor). What luck! Mordo is also trained in the mystical healing and brings Dr. Strange to his supreme teacher. Strange's ego is still inflated and The Ancient One has to be convinced to offer him hope. After studying chakras, amulets and other long-forgotten abilities, Doctor Strange is reborn. However, not to surgery, as there is a more pressing matter. A former apprentice, Caesillius (Mads Mikkelsen) of the Ancient One is causing tremendous problems on earth. Dr. Strange's first mission may be to try and stop this formidable foe. Can he do it with the help of Mordo, The Ancient One, and another mystic named Wong? First, I do not watch many superhero movies as they are not my preferred view but, finding Cumberbatch a very compelling performer, I chose this one. Mr. Benedict does not disappoint, as he is a very handsome and talented actor. Likewise, the other thespians are first rate, especially Swinton. But, I was hoping to see a movie where a superhero uses his unique powers to rescue average folks and, somewhere along the way, get the girl. This does not happen. In addition, while the special effects may have been better on the big screen, on my paltry 20 inch they were busy, confusing, overworked.

Now Marvel has become such a household name and quality label that at this point people will just about watch any Marvel film thats released... ...and they won't be disappointed coz it's REALLY good. The casting of Cumberbatch was brilliant. He has the perfect combination of wittiness, arrogance, charisma and is incredibly likable and has a great sense of comedic timing. They also considered other actors (Keanu Reeves, Jake Gyllenhaal, Joaquin Phoenix, etc) for this role (and Cumberbatch almost had to skip because of his Hamlet play) but the film would not have been the same without Benedict. The film's story takes a bit of time to build Strange's character before it gets to the meat but I found it very well done and didn't feel like it slowed down the movie. Once the action starts we get amazing VFX scenes, I mean it has been a long time (could be since The Matrix came out in 1999) since I've been wowed by VFX, but this film does it! A-level flawless effects work. Made me feel a bit sorry I'd went and saw it in 2D coz those VFX scenes will probably work wondrously well in 3D or IMAX (reviews seem to confirm that). Talking about the Matrix, this film reminded me of it at times. It also has elements from Inception and probably some other films but it never felt like it ripped them off (The Matrix itself 'ripped off' many other classics). At 115 mins Dr. Strange is one of the shorter ones in the MCU but it didn't feel like it needed to be longer.

","Marvel came out on top with the thrilling ensemble epic ""Captain America: Civil War."" But while ""Doctor Strange"" could have been the company's victory lap while introducing movie audiences to a cosmic new branch of the MCU, instead, this tale of magic and world-threatening mayhem is Marvel at it's most mediocre.The story itself makes sense only in broad strokes. Try to pick out the particulars of Kaecilius's plan, and you'll be left with far more questions than answers. Though Mads is riveting in his creepy make-up and confident glowers, his villain goes the way of too many MCU baddies by being too vaguely realized in his emotions and backstory to have a powerful emotional impact. However, Mikkelsen's wry humor honed over seasons of ""Hannibal"" comes in handy to deliver one of the film's funniest moments, involving a nonchalant exchange that has a confused Kaecilius calling the titular hero ""Mister Doctor.""Unfortunately, this is one of the few jokes that work. Under the direction of Scott Derrickson (""Sinister""), ""Doctor Strange"" rejects the broader comedic moments of quips and pratfalls that the MCU has made part of its signature in favor of a dryer wit. Which would have been great, if it worked. As it was, joke after joke from Strange — including a run about people with solo names like Adele, Aristotle and Eminem — fell flat, leaving a cavernous silence in a theater where laughter was meant to be. This speaks to the central problem of ""Doctor Strange"": Benedict Cumberbatch has been wildly, woefully miscast.Now, I admire that Derrickson tried to make the MCU his own, folding in trippy and sometimes nightmarish visuals of the astral planes and Mirror Dimension. He swung for the fences, and while the CGI bodies are sometimes jarringly rubbery, it's a dizzying delight to see how these stylish sorcerers bends the streets of London, New York and Hong Kong into M.C. Escher- inspired constructs of chaos. However, while the action scenes have great settings, the fights themselves lack zing, leaving the stakes feeling weightless.All in all, ""Doctor Strange"" is fine, and sometimes fun. But I've come to expect so much more from Marvel. With ""Captain America,"" ""Thor,"" ""Iron Man"" and ""The Avengers,"" the shrewd studio casts films impeccably, bringing together an astonishing array of actors to create captivating on screen chemistry and wonderfully larger-than-life characters. Following in the footsteps of the Batman and Spider-Man movies that came before, the MCU has been raising the bar on what audiences should demand from superhero spectacle.

If there was a Marvel movie that was going to revitalize my interest in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it would have been this film. Doctor Strange is a different sort of superhero and usually tells different sorts of stories that are much more comics and science fiction in nature, compared to more common Hulk-Smash Marvel storylines. This film boasts an especially fine cast with Benedict Cumberbatch (BBC's ""Sherlock"") as Stephen Strange and Mads Mikkelsen (who plays the lead in the brilliant and under seen ""Hannibal"" TV series. Watch it NOW if you haven't!) as the villainous Kaecilius, along with Tilda Swinton and Rachel McAdams. But despite a strong cast, a more interesting of superhero than most, and top notch production values, it's hard to put my finger on what went wrong with the film.

The villains are my second biggest issue with Marvel. I have never found Loki to be a good villain, he's more of a meddler, who I believed has been stretched too far.

It's not till about an hour into the film that the real plot gets going;the first half just serving as backstory and exposition. Except for a couple of glimpses of Mads Mikkelsen's character and his goons. And it's a good thing we dont see more of them. They are the epitome of hokey and downright comical.

It has some some interesting philosophies built into it. That being said I feel like the Batman universe (not one movie, or show or comic but the entire Batman collection) already kinda did this. There were points that reminded me of Klarion which ain't technically Batman but my first introduction to him was Batman th animated serious from the 90s. There were points that reminded me of Darkseid which is technically Superman based but shows up a lot with Justice League, Young Justice and Titans (Teen Titans) which are Batman formed groups. Some even reminded me of Ray's Al Ghul, which is solely Batman universe. There was a scene that seemed reminiscent of the ""Luke I am your father"" scene. It felt like it stole aspects from different existing story lines and groups of storylines. Despite feeling I unoriginal it felt without the cgi it was nothing. The opening scene was over the top cgi to draw you in and honestly my reaction was if you're going to green screen the whole movie I don't want to watch it. I am not saying the acting was bad merely that they did not rely enough on the acting to make it worth much. Certain aspects of the storyline felt rushed because they cut dialog and character development to add cgi action scenes. I watched other Disney Marvel movies and stopped because I felt they were shallow in terms of characters, character development and storyline, the only reason I watched this is because I heard it was different and more of what I wanted in terms of complexity. Honestly maybe a bit but in the end I felt it still favored special effects over the characters and storyline. In the end I don't care about the characters or what happens next in the story and that's where it failed - I don't want to see the sequel because I don't care.",/review/rw3792523/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_(2016

Yes, the performances of Benedict Cumberbatch, Benedict Wong and Mads Mikkelsen all deliver what they needed to do, in order to make this a really good film, but it is Swinton's performance that really brings the energy into the film.

","'Doctor Strange', as I anticipated, met my expectations well. Marvel has forever done such a strong job at creating stories and investing ones at that. As an introduction film, 'Doctor Strange' ranks among the top for me, sitting only behind 'Iron Man' and 'Captain America: The First Avenger'. As I previously said, we witness a Marvel story that strays away from what we are used to. We are introduced to magic and spirit instead of genetically altered beings and high-tech suits... First and foremost, this was one of the most appealing-to-the-eye films Marvel has made. It is the best 3D movie I have ever watched in theaters and I would highly recommend to view in this format but of course, a standard viewing will satisfy as well. To my friends and myself, we each made reference to 'Inception', and 'Doctor Strange' surely gives off that feel, yet better. A wild trip for any viewer... I believe that Benedict Cumberbatch was made for this role. His suave charisma and witty intelligence carries the film with his every appearance on screen.

","A few years ago when I found out that Benedict Cumberbatch was being cast as the title character in this movie I was totally against that choice because I felt that he didn't really look like Dr. Strange, but when I first saw the theatrical posters for this movie I immediately changed my mind. As the movie opens we see Strange and his girlfriend Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) who also happens to be a nurse at the same hospital where Strange works, and not to much later we see Strange get into a very dangerous car accident and suffers from severe nerve damage as a result of the accident. After Strange recovers he goes to a basketball court and talks to a man named Jonathan Pangborn (Benjamin Bratt) who was paralyzed and tells Strange about this place in Turkey that allowed him to walk again. So Strange goes there and seeks help to heal his nerves meeting a man named Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor), and a monk called ""The Ancient One"" (Tilda Swinton) who teach him about the mystic arts. Strange is also required to read books on specific topics of sorcery and meets the librarian there named Wong (Benedict Wong).Then trouble arises and Strange has to fight a sorcerer who was taught by ""The Ancient One"" named Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) and his minions in order to save the world from ""The Dark Dimension"". The film was directed by Scott Derrickson who also co-wrote the screenplay with C. Robert Cargill and Jon Spaihts which all three of them did an effective job of focusing on the characters rather than on the fight scenes and special effects, and also at times the dialogue is completely hilarious. The performances are very good especially from Cumberbatch, McAdams, Ejiofor, Swinton, and Mikkelsen. The special effects are reminiscent of Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"" (2010), and Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968), but the only difference is that this movie didn't win its well deserved Oscar in the visual effects category even though Jon Favreau's ""The Jungle Book"" was a good choice but the special effects weren't as good as this movie.

","The movie ""Dr. Strange"" is one of the best movies that was released in 2016. It's about an arrogant neurosurgeon Dr. Stephen Strange's (Benedict Cumberbatch). A tragic car accident leaves Strange's hands permanently paralyzed. He wanted to go back to his occupation, but he needed to fix his hand. So he tried everything in allopathy medical but didn't find any cure. So he started to look other ways to find a cure.Then he founded a guy who gets fixed by meditation.First, he didn't believe at all, although he went to meet that guy and he told everything how he got cured. After meeting that guy, he went to the mysterious place close to Himalaya. When he gets to the Himalaya, he quickly learned that there is a battle going on that can destroy reality in a way. Before long, Strange is forced to choose between his life of fortune and status or leave it all behind to defend the world as the most powerful sorcerer in existence. One of the most glaring sins of ""Doctor Strange"" is how quickly Strange masters magic. There isn't much tension in his arc. While he struggles briefly at first to keep up with other students The Ancient One has taken under her care, he's soon stealing sacred books out from under Wong (Benedict Wong), the sharp-eyed master who protects the texts at The Ancient One's behest. Strange plays by his own rules, growing far beyond the skills of those around him. There were deep focuses in the movie. Which showed the relationship between characters and objects in their environment. For example- when Strange trains with Mordo and learns how to use magic. Also, High Angles were shown in the movie. The camera was positioned above the subjects and made the subjects to appear small and insignificant. For example- When Strange gets chased by the villain Baron Mordo and the buildings collapsed. Overall I really enjoyed the movie. The director Scott Derrickson did an excellent job to create this movie. He provided the good plot, angles, sound, shots, lighting etc. The actors did very good job with their roles and contribution. Also, the director was successful to help the actors act their roles better. I would recommend this movie to people who enjoy fantasy and action.",/review/rw3792523/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_(2016

","A perfect blend of stunning visual effects, character development, and even a hint the avant-garde in this strange superhero film of East-meets-West. Unpredictable. That is definitely not a word typically associated with superhero genre movies. Not that the plot was entirely unpredictable, but Benedict Cumberbatch delivers a very Patrick Stewart-esque performance as the neurosurgeon turned mystic Dr. Strange in the film that bares his name. This is a superhero film that strikes a strategic balance between traditional superhero storytelling and social commentary. Not without the trademark explosions and dynamic action sequences, Doctor Strange is clearly concerned with and focuses on the character development of Dr. Strange. In a film that could have so easily rested its laurels upon the innovative, intriguing, and exquisite visual effects, it chose to place more emphasis on the drama between characters. Ordinarily, if you follow my blog, you know that I do not typically write positively about superhero films, with some exceptions such as: Batman Returns, Deadpool, X-Men: Days of Future Past, or Guardians of the Galaxy; however, Marvel/Disney's Doctor Strange was incredibly enjoyable as both a movie AND film (and yes, there is a difference). For those in the audience who perhaps struggle with being self-centered, the plot and character development in Doctor Strange will likely ring true and act as a mirror of how you may actually come across to people; and furthermore, how to break the cycle. Although this is clearly a typical blockbuster movie, there are trace-amounts of many elements often found in art house films in the stylistic way some of the sequences are shot.

","Of all the the adaptions of comic books into film this is probably one the least faithful, changing several characters from their attitudes powers and even skin colors just to make a quick buck. And before you think of labeling me a racist know this, the two characters whose race was changed were both Asian and were made black and white just to appeal to the American demographic which seems stupid since there are more Asians in the world than both white and black people combined. Marvel is very guilty of race changing for the sake of ""diversity"" now they are also responsible for white washing characters which seem counterintuitive to their political agenda. Next they'll make Luke Cage a small Inuit man, Johnny Storm will be a 50 foot reptile terrorizing Tokyo, Nick Fury will be an alien from Planet X, Thor will be Zeus, The Hulk will be an old man Alzheimer's who constantly forgets how to smash, and Spider-Man will sprout wing and call himself angel. Turning established characters into slightly different versions of the same character yet still calling them by the name of the old characters seems stupid and pointless when you can just create a new character instead even Stan Lee said he was against that kind of thinking. Speaking of the creators of Dr. Strange the filmmakers neglected to contact Steve Ditko because he was just a silly old man who created all the characters in their not cinema ""film"". The part about Steve Ditko being silly was me being sarcastic in case no one picked up on that. Eggs Benedict Cabbagepatch Kids is again the same old character the art arrogant genius who nobody gets the same character he and Johnny Depp always play. Baron Mordo is now black and now a totally different character and steals a sacred scroll or something. White ugly old lady with cancer who thinks she can play a wise old Asian man senses the chosen one will come. Doctor strange The neurosurgeon is an arrogant blowhard genius with a heart of gold, gets into a car crash and his hands are crushed so he can no longer perform surgery. He spends almost all his money trying to fix his hands which at best would take years of therapy without magic. But he's a spoiled Narcissistic brat And wants his hands fixed now, obviously with no luck. Then He hears about this one guy who was a paraplegic who can now walk which to a sane person would sound like bologna. But he a gullible idiot and he falls for it and low and behold it's real, and he meets Crazy cancer lady who thinks she's Asian. Cancer lady tells him he must perceive beyond his senses not be limited by his thinking and more quoting Yoda and poof his hands are healed and he's the new sorcerer supreme. But he's now tasked with defeating Baron Mordo Evil black guy and Evil white guy played buy a terrible Swedish actor who may or may not be also white washing an Asian character. It's hard to say because not much was known about the character since he was a very minor character originally. But he likely wasn't Swedish with a name like kaecilius which sound Mediterranean, so I'll say Maddy Mickeymouse is also Playing a whitewashed character. Blah blah blah, he wants to take over the world by releasing an ancient fire monster because he's predictable and one dimensional like every other character in this overproduced CGI heap of garbage.

The opening seen alone already feels like it was worth every penny. The movie is also very deep and thought provoking. ""Civil War"" was thought-provoking in a political way, and this is thought provoking in a science/psychological way. Benedict Cumberbaych does amazingly as always, but I do feel like he was typecast. He seems to be playing the ""I'm smarter than you and I'm going to let you know I'm smarter than you every chance I get"" character over and over. I'm worried he'll become like Johnny Depp and end up eventually becoming a parody of himself. I don't want to spoil anything, because like I said before, it's better to go in knowing nothing. I will say that I hope Marvel takes more risks with more obscure characters and that Fox finally stops being selfish and just gives them the rights to ""X-Men"" and ""Fantastic Four"" already! I want to see Tony Stark, Stephen Strange, Bruce Banner, Hank Pym, and Reed Richards have a science debate. Just make one big banter-fest movie of these characters. Just witty back and forth dialogue between them. That would be awesome! I'm excited to see how this movie ties in to ""Infinity War."" Definitely looking forward to seeing Doctor Strange appear in future movies.

","The fabled MCU world is an interesting creation for cinema, and I think the only thing we have it compare to are the Bond films for consistency. Star Trek and Wars are so fragmented now that once around the curve from one series or film to the next, the roads tends to fade away. Marvel, wisely, connects at least this part of the universe together quite well, binding all the titles into one plot. (Fox owns the X-Men of course and the two studios have never been able to craft a co-agreement. They should, that film would be epic, probably 3 hours plus too). So here we have a new entry that opens up new worlds, literally, of reality and being. No specifics here and acting kudos go to one and all. The film is tight and constantly entertaining, action here and humor there. Some of the finest jokes are the smallest of them. It is amazing the laugh you can get out of a collar. Visuals are, of course, the world of computers year again, but so well executed that one is amazed at the complexity of the software behind these fellows burning the midnight oil. There should be a credit for gallons of coffee consumed. This is a beautiful film. Some shots are paintings and more are Escher prints. Small stuff - the new Marvel logo is very impressive, two scenes at the end are keepers and as one reviewer noted, the quiet conversion in the snow at night is memorable.

","Marvel's Doctor Strange is as formulaic in plotting and execution as an origin story can become, but they still deliver thoroughly exciting and occasionally mind-bending entertainment. The plot follows the story of the talented neurosurgeon Doctor Stephen Strange who, after a tragic car accident, must put ego aside and learn the secrets of a hidden world of mysticism and alternate dimensions. Based in New York City's Greenwich Village, Doctor Strange must act as an intermediary between the real world and what lies beyond, utilizing a vast array of metaphysical abilities and artifacts to protect the Marvel cinematic universe.The action shifts from New York to Kathmandu to multiverses to sanctums to Hong Kong and finally to the dark realms.The pace is slick and you will almost feel like you are on LSD or any other psychedelic drug if you will. The film revolves around magic and mysticism which transcend the bounds of time.If only the makers would have put in an effort to transcend their bounds yet we still have at our hands a superhero film unlike any other and this is Doctor Strange's biggest win. While comparisons to Inception are obvious, with cities bending and folding into themselves, this goes way beyond that. The colors, the upside-down, fight-on-the-wall, jump-to-this-dimension action; the way the mystical powers they use enhance everything even further, it all left me astounded by how awesome it was to watch on the big screen. I don't even know how they pulled it off, nor do I care, I was so caught up in what I was watching that I didn't even need to think about what filmmaking trickery they were using Benedict Cumberbatch owns this film totally immersing himself into the initially arrogant and egotistical Doctor(yeah shades of Sherlock) and later a gifted and mature sorcerer.Suave in dialogue delivery and brilliance in action scenes, he leaves a lasting impact. Chiwetel Ejiofor impresses as the strong-willed master sorcerer Modo & Tilda Swindon is brilliant cast as the complicated and seemingly immortal Sorcerer Supreme. Rachel McAdams leaves her mark in the similar capacity as did Pepper to Tony and Jane to Thor. Mads Mikkelson plays the primary antagonist Kaecilius playing the generic not-so-powerful Marvel villain and the role doesn't do justice to his talent. While Marvel fans got a taste of what to expect with the kaleidoscopic Quantum Realm at the end of Ant-Man, Derrickson's movie cranks that up at every opportunity, and it's honestly breathtaking. In an early sequence, The Ancient One rockets a skeptical Doctor Strange through a series of alternate dimensions, and as the Ancient One narrates through voice over the display of infinite universes, you can't help but be just as hypnotically stunned as the arrogant surgeon Clear inspiration is drawn from the beautiful work of Steve Ditko in the character's earliest comics, and it's brought to life in a stunning fashion with awesome visual effects that just weren't cinematically available up until now Much more than just portal-hopping, the film utilizes what is called ""the Mirror Dimension"" to create what is essentially a most surreal interpretation of the real world where cityscapes can be shifted and turned at will and gravity flipped (all of it imperceptible to the non-magically inclined). These sequences, along with a finale that utilizes time manipulation in amazing ways truly make Doctor Strange stand out as one of the most visually inventive and incredible films put out by Marvel Studios.. If there was ever a film that needed to be seen in 3D, it's certainly Doctor Strange. Marvel has stepped up their 3D game to no end, and while there's still elements that need a little more tweaking, the usage of the format really does carry this film out of this world, and into the next. Don't hesitate to book an IMAX 3D if you will, as the aspect ratio and sound tweaks in large format really do go well with this 3D masterwork. This a must watch (theatrical) for Marvel aficionados.Experiences and interpretations with this movie will be different for everyone, and casual movie goers might not connect with Strange's story as deeply as MCU followers would.Nevertheless, everyone is sure to be blown away by how totally stunning this vibrant, visual extravaganza is.",/review/rw3792523/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_(2016

","""DR Strange"" is the one of the most powerful character in MRVEL Comics. The master of magic's who save the world from the accidents, enemy of the multiverse as per comics. Who can control one of the most precious infinity stone i.e. Time Stone. For these reason he became more powerful super hero.
We all know that marvel comics and Marvel Cinematic Universe is occupy a large number of fanbase. Doctor Strange is a 2016 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the 14th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe . The film was directed by Scott Derrickson from a screenplay he wrote with Jon Spaihts and C. Robert Cargill, and stars Benedict Cumberbatch as surgeon Stephen Strange along with Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams, Benedict Wong, Michael Stuhlbarg, Benjamin Bratt, Scott Adkins, Mads Mikkelsen, and Tilda Swinton. In the film, Strange learns the mystic arts after a career-ending car crash.
If we see the plot of movie , In New York City, Stephen Strange, a wealthy, acclaimed, and arrogant
Neurosurgeon, severely injures his hands in a car crash, leaving him unable to operate. Fellow surgeon Christine Palmer tries to help him move on, but strange vainly pursues experimental surgeries to heal his hands. Strange learns about Jonathan Pangborn, a paraplegic who Mysteriously regained use of his legs. Pangborn directs Strange to Kamar-Taj, where he is taken in by Mordo, a sorcerer under the Ancient One. The Ancient One demonstrates her power to Strange,
Revealing the astral plane and other dimensions such as the Mirror Dimension. The actual movie starts from here; in between this plot we all notice that Dr strange is the owner of a well sharp mind. So he quickly learns the mystic arts. As we concentrate in the dialog of the movie each and every dialogs are very powerful and meaningful also. The ancient one's dialog on the Dr strange give up the ego and saw the entire world how world is actual in nature. One of the best dialog in movie in my view is- ""who are you in this vast multiverse, Mr. Strange?"" by the ancient one. And another most precious dialog is ""We never lose our demons, Mordo we only learn to live above them."" To Mordo who is master of mystic art and martial art also and trained it to Dr strange.
In graphics quality and screenplay and CGI effect is top class. And movie is ending by MCU in it's own style. We get two mid credits scenes where, Strange decides to help Thor, who has brought his brother Loki to Earth to search for their father, Odin.In a post credits scene, Mordo confronts Pangborn and steals the mystical energy he uses to walk, telling him that Earth has ""too many sorcerers"".
To get rate on movie I gave 10 on 10 as a marvel fan and also for this beautiful movie. I recoment you to see this beautiful movies. I told that you my fall in love with marvel comics and MCU movie creating style. And the last word from me ""iss aanaat bhramvand me tum kon ho review parne wale?"". HE HE.

Chiwetel Ejiofor was good as Mordo - going through the degeneration from loyal hack of the ancient one to doubting Thomas in a believable way.

","The visuals are undoubtably fantastic, leading to some very unique action set-pieces that have enough style to set them apart from other superhero films, and its outstanding soundtrack is one of the best of the MCU. It's a shame, then, that the story and tone of 'Doctor Strange' drag it down to be one of the worst films of the Marvel cinematic universe. Stephen Strange is an unlikeable protagonist, one who we can never root for, and this means that the audience doesn't really have any reason to care about the story. Also, the narrative is very predictable and the film doesn't have a proper grasp on time; the 'training montage' is over very quickly and because there is no indication of how much time has passed, it seems as if Strange has gone from a nobody to the sorcerer supreme in mere days. Therefore, it feels entirely unbelievable that Strange can masterfully use his powers and save the world by the end of this film. Throughout the picture, Strange should have been struggling to use his powers, indicating to the audience that he is still learning and developing over time. Another big issue with the movie is its ham-fisted attempts at comedy. It is never funny, yet its 'humour' is always prevalent, even undermining serious moments on several occasions, and this becomes extremely annoying. Sure, a few comedic moments wouldn't have gone amiss, but since the character of 'Doctor Strange' isn't a funny one, this film should have had more of a focus on its serious elements and getting them to be successful.

The hero of Cumberbatch is not Merlin, and not the Christmas magician. The genesis of this character takes rather in computer games. Yes, Stephen Strange became a combat magician. That's why his formation was shown so quickly, that's why his initiation looked so blurry. However, this is quite logical - from the place to the battle!

","I didn't quite know what to expect with this one, but being a comic book movie fan, I booked my IMAX tickets for day one of the latest Marvel movie instalment. Being that this would be the beginning of a new chapter in the MCU, I was hoping for a movie that would showcase the magic and mysticism in an original, darker and less cliché way than the rest of the Marvel movies to date. Unfortunately, that wasn't to happen. It started off really well, highlighting Doc's origin, his arrogance, his thirst to be the best. I really liked Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One, regardless of the complaints of the character being white-washed, I thought she portrayed the character very well. Benedict Cumberbatch played his role well, giving us a glimpse of the Sherlock Holmes arrogance.",/review/rw3792523/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_(2016

","MCU's 14th installment in the form of magic and mysticism is something I had waited for since the start of MCU itself. Finally watching it coming to life on screen and that too by a wonderful performer by Benedict Cumberbatch himself is more than something to bargain. Doctor Strange is a visual treat for both Marvel fans and movie going fans alike. The 3D VFX throughout the movie is top notch and director Scott Derrickson just nails his way of weaving a story-line with a new villain named Kaecilius. To many, this villain may be underrated but once you pick up a Doctor Strange Prelude comic, you may actually know the back story of Kaecilius and his purpose of taking the dark side. Tilda, being an amazing actress herself, playing The Ancient One is a delight. I love the fact that Marvel is overstepping the borders of gender equality and racism stuffs. No Asian male, this time, it's a white woman with no hair, with a title ""THE ANCIENT ONE"". Yes, I dig it! As usual, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Mordo is fantastic. Watching Chiwetel and Cumberbatch together after 12 Year A Slave is wonderful. Mordo's story arc is a solid way of portraying a future villain in future sequels. Personally, I have no issue with Benedict's accent as many others, it's absolutely great to watch him on screen and that too with so much visual effects. It's like Sherlock, but with a ruby red Cloak Of Levitation, a french cut and some mystical stuffs. My verdict - Go watch it in IMAX 3D and experience a mind-tripping movie.",/review/rw3792523/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_(2016

And then if he continues to help the whole of society, by fighting off evil, can he still be called a doctor, or does he transcend his role to be omnipotent? The role of the Ancient One could be seen as that of a dictator - but she does seem to be a wise woman. It is clear that Western doctors today probably get pulled into Buddhism and alternative methods of healing throughout their practices.

","If Marvel keeps this streak up, they might possibly make a superhero film on the same level as the Dark Knight. Doctor Strange is about a neurosurgeon named Stephen Strange who has it made. He's rich, famous and he even has an on again, off again girlfriend. However that all changes when he gets into an awful car accident and completely ruins his hands. It looks like he can never operate again so he does everything he can to fix his hands. His last ditch effort is to seek The Ancient One-a Celtic mystic that resides in the far East. Stephen then finds himself in a world of magic, sorcery and alternate dimensions. The rabbit hole goes deeper though as one of the Ancient One's old students has sided with an evil entity named Dormamu who wants to-you guessed it-take over the world and Stephen is the only one who can stop him. Even if this movie wasn't tied to the MCU, it would still be very interesting and a great film in and of itself. It still has many of the previous entries' quirks such as goofy humor, great action but one dimensional villains. However, they balance that out with new things such as psychedelic visuals, great character development and creative action sequences. They really go all out with the possibility of magic and many of the best parts of the film revolve simply around the idea of these people being able to bend reality to their will. The actors all do a spectacular job as well bringing life to these performances. But of course this would all be for nothing if it weren't for the great writing and characters. Even though this villain is nothing to brag home about, we might get another new villain in the future that's just even more menacing and interesting. I would not only suggest Doctor Strange for fans of the MCU but also for anyone who just wants to see a cool film.

797,27 April 2023,dakotadickenson-83457,8," Amazing cinematic storytelling
","Doctor Strange is unlike any superhero origin story, that has some of the best storytelling in the MCU. The story follows Doctor Stephen Strange who was once a brilliant, but arrogant neurosurgeon, only to have his career ruined and his life thrown into chaos after a tragic accident. On a journey for guidance and self healing, Doctor Strange travels to Kamar-Taj to seek help to get his life he once had back, only to be drawn into the world of mystic arts. When dark forces come that are set on destroying reality, Doctor Strange must decide whether to take his life back he once had or become the worlds most powerful sorcerer and save the world from a being known as Dormammu. So first off, Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange is by far one of the best castings ever to come to the MCU. The way he captures Doctor Strange's success, failure, and newfound reality is done in a way no other actor could have done. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Baron Mordo is one of my favorite characters of the film. Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One was born to play her character. Rachel McAdams as Christine Palmer I thought was great too. I just wished we would of gotten to know her character better. Benedict Wong as Wong is the funniest character of the whole film. Mads Mikkelsen as Kaecilius I thought was great for the most part. The only problem I have with his character, is I don't think they really explored his purpose for being the villain enough for us to care about what he is doing, but as far as Mads Mikkelsen's portrayal of the character goes, he does a good job. The best parts of the film other than the actors have to be the visual effects. They're unlike anything that's ever been shown in the MCU before or in any film period and definitely doesn't get the credit or truly deserves. Overall, Doctor Strange is definitely one of the best visually stunning movies of the MCU that introduces us to a new kind of superhero that can relate to all of us.

","Visually : Stunningly and trippy. The looks of the film is beautiful and the CGO are really impressive and contribute a lot to the magical effects, surrealist theme of the movie. The director is good, every action, every camera move, every object placed has a symbolism meaning behind it. However, they used overused CGI a little bit in my opinion, every magic scene is undoubtedly beautiful, yes, but also disoriented, everyone who came out of that movie has a dizziness of some kind. To make matters worse, the antagonists doesn't stood out so the blurry, shaky fighting sequence is even harder to discern than your average Action Movie. Soundtrack: Just your typical forgettable songs backing the scene it's playing. However, I think most of the songs are in Minor, plus that with the serious theme, making the mood of the movie to be creepier and darker than most Marvel's movie. And that's a good thing. Plot: Every superhero movie now has a plot so predictable you don't even need a trailer to guess what the overall movie plot is about. However, unlike the others, this one is pretty tight with few significant plot holes. The greatest thing about the plot, however, is the detailed, the director focused so much on every detailed about the in-fighting of Stephen Strange between his egotistic old lifestyle and a life of sacrifice for the good of others.

","One thing I've realized when watching the MCU all the way through, is how Marvel don't put nearly the same amount of effort into all of their movies.

And one of the most prominent examples of this is this movie, Dr. Strange. That being said, I did quite enjoy a fair portion of the movie. The main character is great, he's well written and funny, and Benedict Cumberbatch obviously helps a lot with his comedic timing and facial expressions. I also like the set designs, and the movie had a very distinct tone for a little while, which I liked. The crazy action scenes that takes place within the mirror realm are also great. Unfortunately though, for every thing I enjoyed, there were one thing I didn't. The rest of the characters are very forgettable, apart from maybe The Ancient One. The villain is particularly bad, although at this point I'm not even suprised considering Marvel's track record when it comes to villains. The plot itself is also super forgettable, it's just another case of the main character having to save the world without any compelling personal reason. The pacing is also a little off. Sometimes the movie slows way down, sometimes it progresses way too quickly. The finale is not very interesting, although I do like its comedic tone. Overall, this is a watchable movie.

Another 0.5 I deduct for something the marvel mostly got wrong. The villain.

","I agree with other negative reviewers when they say the main characters were not developed enough to care about them. They don't have a good build-up to see progression or personal growth. I can't comment on acting because I get too caught up in the plot to notice acting. I notice the bad acting in a lot of Lifetime movies though. People are complaining about the formulaic plot, but I was too distracted by the weird sorcery, time travel, and dimension thing to notice it. Witchcraft in this movie was portrayed in a very different manner than what I am used to seeing in other movies, so it particularly distracted me. The evil elements and villains were really different from what I was used to seeing, and that made the movie interesting even if the plot was too much of a brain dead action flick. People complained about how the plot is illogical because Dr.Strange is new to sorcery, but he was able to beat top sorcerers, but they explain it by saying he is smart with photographic memory. He read a lot of magic books. Others complain that they didn't show how why he got interested in sorcery, that was clear to me too; He switched from caring about a cure to caring that the whole world was at risk of annihilation. Morivation was there. Others complained the romance didn't make sense and came out of nowhere. What romance? It was an ex girlfriend feeling sorry for him. Then it seemed more like a friendship built on familiarity, no romance. I watched this movie the same day that I watched Disney's Moana and I thought the plots of these two movies were so similar. No one else mentioned this. Really, watch Dr.Strange and Moana on the same day and you will see what I mean. Somehow this movie inspired me to work harder for what I care about.

","In Marvel's plan to release feature films about relatively unknown, individual superheroes—such as Ant-Man and Deadpool—it succeeds again with Doctor Strange, introducing the mystic arts and the spirit into the modern superhero film. Once again, Marvel changes the archetypal ""hero"", with an unprecedented origin story and a new set of superpowers, other than the typical super strength and iron suits that we are used to in other superhero movies. Doctor Strange takes a look into the life of a brilliant and wealthy neurosurgeon. In the operating room—reminiscent of Grey's Anatomy—Dr. Stephen Strange was the central individual, the surgeon performing the delicate, life-saving surgery on the brain. He was pompously easygoing, knowing that he was remarkably intelligent. Outside of the OR, Dr. Strange lived affluently, with an extravagant penthouse, luxurious car, and expensive belongings. In addition, he maintained a steady relationship with his girlfriend, Dr. Christine Palmer. His career as an accomplished neurosurgeon was cut short after a severe car accident, as he lost control of his hands. For months, Dr. Strange looked for a surgical cures from around the world, undergoing several operations, only to spend all of his money and lose his relationship with Dr. Palmer. Desperate, and with nothing else to lose, Dr. Strange finally turned to the spiritual answer for his tremble in Nepal, where he found the Ancient One, a master of the mystic arts. His arrogant attitude shown through, as he was incredulous of the existence of the mystic arts. However, after a demonstration by the Ancient One, Dr. Strange realized that he knew nothing, and he entered the school for the mystic arts, learning from the Ancient One and Mordo, a sorcerer. Dr. Strange, an intelligent man, was able to pick up the mystic arts quickly by reading books and self-teaching. However, he quickly discovered the dangers revolved around the mystic arts, the villainous sorcerers. Kaecilius was a sorcerer who learned from the Ancient One, but became corrupted by ambition. He sought out Dormammu, a powerful villain who wanted to consume the universe containing Earth, and learned to manipulate reality. The Ancient One, protector of the Earth, passed on her duty to Dr. Strange, now a gifted sorcerer. He was fiercely reluctant, as he turned to her just to fix his tremble so that he could return to his work. However, he realized his situation and his new power, and with Mordo and another sorcerer, Wong, they fought for the maintenance of their Earth. Dr. Strange finally defeated Dormammu with the manipulation of time, but he was still left with protecting the Earth from future threats.

I felt like I was watching a Disney comedy at a point at it took me out of the rest of the film, because I knew the stakes wouldn't be there anymore.

Benedict Cumberbatch is great as Doctor Strange, he literally doesn't need to fake anything about his character, he just is the character. One really funny thing that I noticed is that despite his character being American, his character has a very British sense of humour, which always leads to the funniest situations in the movie, like the scene where Wong was listening to Beyoncé music and strange takes some books while he isn't looking. Hilarious. Tilda Swinton is great as the ancient one, seriously, how does marvel make such good casting choices? Same goes for Chiwetel Ejiofor as Karl Mordo, ignore those whitewashing and balckwashing complaints, they are great casting choices. Another flaw people had found was Mads Mikkelsen's villain Kaecillius, who stole pages from a book from the ancient one's library. And using these pages, he masters the dark arts. He is great in his role, because he is in his comfort zone, playing a villain.

Through out the decade long tenure of the Marvel cinematic universe and over 10 big budget releases I can say with certainty that no one of the movies released stood out as an actually good comic book movie. Maybe an exciting action flick but not a good comic book movie and this is where even Fox surpasses Marvel let alone Sony with Spiderman films or Warner with its DC titles. Iron man didn't cut it and Avengers with its Chitauri invasion plot certainly didn't either. The reason for that is two things cinematography of Marvel movies which is uninspiring to say the least and Marvel's usual lack of interest or ability in preservation of its source material when transferred over to the big screen. Take Civil War into consideration a movie I watched again recently just prior to watching Doctor Strange and still ended it with being confused by the sheer idiocy of it. Marvel has been doing some really unappreciated things with its source material since the first day and when you want to bring in the comic book fans, the people that have made mcu actually possible you just should not treat these materials so badly. This is why the general consensus among the hardcore comic book community about mcu is mediocrity.

","Doctor Strange was one of the movie that made me drop my jaw so bad that I couldn't take my eyes of it. I was glad to be a member of IMDb and I wanted to share my opinion about Doctor Strange.
The movie casted Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Stephen Strange, Benedict Wong as Wong, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Karl Mordo, Mads Mikkelsen as Kaecilius, Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One. In my opinion, the acting was quite good, they embodied the characters they were set to play, not just be the character. Cumberbatch did really well being the Wizard and Swinton as the Ancient One, she was on fire! The villains Kaecilius and Dormammu are acted really well, considered as one of the best villains of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
The story was really good: a doctor crashed in a car and when he recovered, he was sent to Nepal to train mystic arts. It was 9% boring to me and it was kinda corny!
I've gotta say, the fight scenes were really EPIC and so were the CGI effects. They were better than Inception (2010). The city moved like a puzzle and characters fought upside down, which was one of my favourite MCU showdowns. But unfortunately, it wasn't how I expected it to be. It didn't win the best Visual Effects but overshadowed by The Jungle Book. That was really unfair, they only did animals talking and nice jungle views but if I was the one to choose the winner, I would definately choose Doctor Strange for its CGI and other special effects. The were jaw-dropping and of course, extremely mind-blowing! That's why I couldn't take my eyes off. The mystic arts KILLED it!
Many scenes were quite unforgettable like when Mordo gave Strange a paper and he thought it was something about mystic arts but it turned out to be a Wi-fi password! I couldn't help myself laughing.
I wasn't sleepy or bored but I was watching this at midnight and I just kept praising the movie for its good actions and VFX. I went like ""Wow!"", ""Awesome!"". My eyes were wide!
To rate this movie, I gave it a 8.6 out of 10. It was quite a BLAST, mostly unforgettable and one of the best of MCU",/review/rw3792523/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_(2016

One interesting thing about the movie is the part where the protagonist dies several times but comes back and defies a great inner demon that is obsessed with power.

Benedict Cumberbatchs character has an amazing journey, from being an arrogant asshole to an arrogant likeable asshole, something not many films can properly portray. The romance between Doctor Strange and Christine is incredible, and is the best the MCU has done with romance to this point. The visual effects are breathtakingly gorgeous, and are the best the MCU has offered to this point. Though the villains motives are rather weak, his energy and performance more then make up for it.

","Right up with Iron Man as Marvel's best individual origin story and probably just outside their top 5 films in all, beaten out by Guardians, Avengers 1, Civil War, Winter Soldier and the aforementioned Iron Man (not necessarily in that order). Cumberbatch is superb as Strange, fantastically arrogant at the start, then excellently portraying his despair in his brutal fall to rock bottom, then his usual charm and wit as he gains confidence again as he begins to master his new found abilities. He is ably supported by a quality cast. Ejiofor and McAdams make the most of slightly underused roles, Wong is great as Wong, Mikkelsen gives Kaecilius a great sense of menace but also humanity and not a little charm of his own and is in my opinion one of Marvels better villains, though again underused a bit (an extra half an hour could have made this right up there with the best comic book movies of all). But the MVP is Swinton as the Ancient One, which considering the controversy of the so called white washing of the roll is a good thing (but what did they want, the Fu Man Chu type portrayed in the comics). She gives her character a sense of mischievousness and an impish charm instead of the staid wise person you may have expected, and her final scene with strange is both heartbreaking and one of the stand out scenes of the whole film. But of course as everyone who sees this will say, the thing that really raises this film are the visuals. I can't believe how some can dismiss them as having seen similar before in Inception. That is like comparing a toddlers drawing to a Rembrandt. Its not just the way the cityscapes are twisted and transformed, but the way the characters interact with them. And as for the scene where the Ancient One casts Strange through the different dimensions to open his mind, it must be one of the most original, inventive and visually stunning scenes ever projected to a screen. Also the inventiveness of the climactic scenes are something that sets this apart from all of the recent Superhero movies, both in the stunning visuals of having our heroes moving forward through a rewinding world, but also in the way Strange uses his ingenuity and not brute power to overcome his foe.",/review/rw3792523/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_(2016

Integration is a necessity when it comes to the string of Marvel movies, and while the movie tells Dr. Strange's own story of growth into the hero everyone loves, and at the end: it introduces another infinity stone; gives a peak about where Dr. Strange will appear next; and essentially develops another villain Dr. Strange must come to terms with. As far as special effects go, well it wasn't quite what I expected, it was better! If mystical spells and a cape with a mind of its own weren't enough, how about rooms converging on themselves and entire cities becoming 20 drifting islands in the sky!

A lot of it was very predictable to the point that you don't have to go to far into the movie to have a solid idea of where it is leading. It played a lot with mysticism, magic, and time making it intriguing and confusing which is OK if you're not paying too much attention, but if you do you might notice that some things contradict and defy the logic that was established previously in the movie. That was one of the issues I had with the ending, which I don't want to spoil. The acting was good and I feel like if I didn't like something about it was probably because of the plot.

For me the only bad thing in the movie was the script and that's because its an origin story and i don't think you can do much about it.Benedict seems so perfect for this role.I love Mad mikellsen's Kaelicius. In my opinion his villain is up there with Loki. His motivations are clear, he doesn't want to destroy earth he wants to save it. I could analyze more about the cast and the performances but overall i think they were all great and they had the right amount of screen time. The visuals are amazing as expected. They portray multiverses in such an amazing an interesting way. The negotiation with Dormamu is my fave scene in the movie. The time loop was propably one of the most clever ways to ""defeat"" a villain i've seen in a movie. It also shows what kind of person is Stephen Strange.

934,12 January 2023,dalyons-09311,9," Nailed the Feel of ""Magic""
","Definitely one of the best MCU entries. This was the movie that really made magic the forefront, and even in a fantasy series, they managed to make it feel so much more magical than anything yet. The visuals are fantastic, not only because of the impressiveness of the visual effects, but also because of the creativity and design. The way they came up with the different ways to morph reality was really cool, and the intricate ways they folded the world on top of itself were fun as well. Lots of movies have magic, but most of them still follow general rules like physics and balance. Doctor Strange is a complete sandbox that does whatever it wants to, and that's really fun. Visually, it was the best experience in the MCU at that point. The music was equally enjoyable. Giacchino has a very catchy main theme that fits the location and source material. The story was also really great, and the transformation from surgeon into magician and superhero was really cool to see. The lore of the sorcerers was interesting, and the ending was amazing. The comedy was strong as well. My main issue with the movie is that they went a bit far with the unlikability of Strange. It's hard to believe his transformation could be this profound this quickly. Over the course of several movies, sure, but he does a complete turnaround too fast. I wish they made him a little more likeable in the early scenes despite his arrogance, which would've made what he did at the end more believable.",/review/rw3792523/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_(2016
935,8 December 2016,kb-01809,8," Doctor Strange
","Back in 1998 director Alex Proyas who was responsible for The Crow and later on I Robot directed a movie starring Keifer Sutherland and Rufus Sewell. It was called Dark City. To this day it is one of the top 5 Science Fictions movies to come out in my lifetime. It was about a guy waking up to find a dead woman in a hotel room who he was framed for murdering. It incorporates aspects of time manipulation and visuals where the city landscapes could be changed and altered to fit the current time. All in all it was pretty much a test set by an alien race that they called Strangers. So why am I bringing this up? Because I keep hearing parallels of Doctor Strange and Inception. And although there are inception like visuals in this movie, it is really more like Dark City than anything else, and in my opinion any movie that reminds me of that already has a step up on the competition. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has been struggling lately. There hasn't been any movies that I would call bad but the quality of entertainment has gone down a bit since it started. Even Civil War wasn't as good as I hoped it to be. I felt like the internal struggle of the Avengers team wasn't really that bad because nobody really wanted to hurt anyone. The whole airport scene was like watching all of our heroes in a slap boxing tournament. The good news is we all know that things are about to drastically change in the MCU. And the first change is Doctor Strange. I am usually the guy who goes to see these movies then has to wait weeks before he can talk to anyone about it because all of his friends take forever to see it. This was the opposite. All my friends saw it and wanted to talk to me about it but I couldn't because I've had a busy month and it took a while. It was really annoying, let me tell ya. Anyway, I saw it and now I'm telling all you how I felt about it. And I'm feeling pretty good. I feel like the MCU has been invigorated and has successfully begun switching gears a bit. Now ask anyone who knows me about my thoughts before the movie came out. I had serious reservations about because of the director. Scott Derrickson is a very well regarded writer, script doctor, and horror director. If you don't know what that means, hes one of the go to guys a studio will call on when they have a high profile script going into production but they need it polished. Whether it's the dialogue or action there a few writers out there who have their niche and are used in this capacity. But up until Doctor Strange all he had directed was the failed remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still, Sinister, and Deliver us from Evil. I really didn't have any faith in him when it came to a story and character that actually mattered in the greater universe. Im sitting here now admitting that I was very wrong. In fact Im giving the guy a great deal of credit to the success of this movie and breathing fresh air into the MCU. Doctor Strange represents Marvels visual best and is rounded out be a very strong cast and a well put together cinematic story. It could have gotten very complicated considering the ideas of time and multiple universes inside an already established one but Kevin Feige and his disciples did a fantastic job of introducing us to a character that the basic cinema goer knows nothing about. I am hoping that the future characters to be introduced like Carol Danvers(Captain Marvel) follows suit. Next up for the MCU is Thor: Ragnarok which is supposed to be like a road movie with Thor and the Hulk, followed, by Guardians of The Galaxy Volume 2, and Black Panther. Im thinking by the time the credits roll on The Infinity Wars, most of our old Avengers will be dead, and the new crew will take over. But don't worry. As seen at the end of Doctor Strange, there is an Infinity Stone that can correct times mistakes. And I'm pretty sure we will get to see Adam Warlock (hopefully played by Dave Wooderson himself( Mathew Mcaunaghey)) take control of the gauntlet and ultimately reset everything. HINT: in the collectors little hideout in GOTG there was a cocoon. It harbors Adam Warlock. Google it. Hes awesome. But until then enjoy the movies. Support your local theaters. Yes you can pretty much download or stream anything you want but there is and never will be a better way to see a movie than on a giant screen with a crowd of people. So there you go.

","Dr. Strange - 8.25/10 One movie I was bound to watch in a theater. I don't believe in watching movies about the time they get released for the simple reason that it would mean washing my face and being social. Needless to mention, the times that I have been to a theater of any kind I went alone. Same for this movie. The internet is filled with discussions and criticism about every possible angle of the movie, especially ""DORMAMMU, I'VE COME TO BARGAIN!"" and bits and pieces of the movie are indeed questionable but for me the real stick in the mud was not being able to utilize Mads Mikkelsen to his potential. Now when I say the guy has a certain talent to him, I mean it. Though if you ask me, someone like Giancarlo Esposito would be ideal for the role; Mads has a villain-like charm to him that can be realized completely only when the direction is apt. Which brings me to my other point: Marvel movie villains are pathetic. One would not expect anything equivalent of say Ridley's Dr. Lecter but even 10% of him would be a delight to watch. That said I can only hope that Marvel takes note of this and does justice to Thanos because only God knows what a catastrophe it would be otherwise. Moving on, I tend to be biased 9/10 times when I have to review Cumberbatch as the lead or even when he is playing the duck. So, I'd leave out my critic with respect to him. Tilda Swinton shows some of her Only Lovers left Alive level performance in this one and full points to her, though the direction in the last of her scenes was not up to the mark. What I loved most is that Ejiofor has moved on since his 2012 days and started making adult choices when it comes to signing movies, The Martian and Dr. Strange included. He is also showing good timing skill. A win-win for everyone, I bet. Benedict Wong is one actor I have always adored and his filmography shows an upward graph as well. I like how Ejiofor and Wong have been re-cast together albeit successfully despite there being a lot of other options.

989,3 December 2016,alinfatu,9," Favorite Marvel Movie Ever
","I will begin this by saying I was hyped about this film since it was announced because I was always attracted to magic and the supernatural and Doctor Strange is one of my favorite Marvel superheroes. PLOT:A simple enough story,a brilliant surgeon's journey from the peak of his career to a ruined man,incapacitated due to an accident.Losing all his money in an attempt to heal his hands,he finds out about a mysterious healer in a place called Kamar-Taj.With his last dollars, he gets a one-way ticket to Nepal to find this place and is introduced like so into a whole new world.He has an affinity for what he discovers to be called ""The Mystic Arts"".He learns and develops quickly but is thrown into a fight with the one who would become his first nemesis,Kaelcilius,too soon.He is almost killed but with the help of his ex-fiancée,Dr. Christine Palmer(who operates on him) he is saved and returns to the Sanctum Sanctorum.He tries to stop Kaelcilius but needs to be rescued again by his teacher,who is killed and leaves him with a valuable lesson.To finally defeated the Zealots he bargains with their boss,catching him into a time loop for all eternity if he does not call his servants off and sets everything right.In the end his ex-friend and mentor,Mordo goes on a quest of finding himself and ends up becoming a sorcerer murderer. Characters: 1)Dr.Stephen Strange:Benedict portrays him amazingly and is always on point with the character.I liked his journey and how he changed and grew to see that he is just a tiny bit of an infinite multiverse.He was pretty good using magic and I hope he will develop quicker to the Sorcerer Supreme. 2)The Ancient One:My favorite character in the movie.She is a wise teacher,has the best quotes,best battle scenes,best entrances and an amazing battle costume.I loved how even she was aware that for higher goals she needed to cross the line and do things she teaches against and also isn't proud of. 3)Kaelcilius:A tragedy of love brought him to Kamar-Taj where he ascended to the rank of master.Tired of following The Ancient One and still haunted by the death of his loved he seeks to stop time,to give his new teacher,Dormammu our world.Mads was amazing in the role,his whole ideology of time as the enemy of humans and them longing for eternity is interesting and really on point.He briefly achieved his goal,a shame he became a mindless one. 4)Karl Mordo:Another prominent student,who doesn't ask questions,doesn't contradict and is pretty adamant about trust and has lots of issues with bending the rules.He was very disappointing and boring and his only interesting feat was that he became a villain. 5)Wong:Decent but underused character,he will surely be seen a lot in the later movies as Strange's right hand. Magic:We are introduced to magic as an energy harnessed from various dimensions to create things of need,to conjure spells.An interesting take on such a vague but intriguing subject. Post-Credit Scenes: 1)Thor scene:takes place in 2017 with Thor asking our Doctor(has gloves,seems more powerful,informed) for help to find his father,trapped on Earth.He accepts with the condition that they would leave our realm as soon as they are reunited. 2)Mordo scene:He went on a quest of getting rid of all the sorcerers of Earth.

","Bottom Line: This movie has a ton of things going for it! Its take on the genre is pretty fresh and it goes deeper in to personal struggle than most superhero movies do. There are parts where the narrative gets rocky, but Benedict Cumberbatch has charisma in spades to get the movie through the rough spots. The movie also goes all out on visual effects which can be the its strongest and weakest asset. The visual splendor creates some mind bending action scenes and add vivid detail to the mystic world of spell-casters that Strange inhabits.

1002,1 September 2020,gbmcleod,5," Strange, Indeed
","First things first:
Stephen Strange's spells are spoken incantations, not gestures. Without invoking an Entity, his spells should not work. There is magic of the mind (very few movies do this), magic with wands (Harry Potter) and magic of the spoken word (Dr. Strange and most other Marvel sorcerers). Yet, no words are used in the movie.
It is more akin to Kung Fu meets the Leonardo DiCaprio movie 'Inception' with the moving landscapes and folding buildings.
If that's what makes a movie good for some, great. But hardly creative. And certainly NOTHING like Dr. Strange comic books.
And making Hilda Swinton The Ancient One just go get good box office and not offend China (the Ancient One was Tibetan, but we wouldn't want to upset China, would we? So, they changed the entire background of The Ancient One to make it palatable to China. Go, Team!) There were many more qualified MALE, ASIAN actors who could have filled this role more admirably.
The movie is gimmicky, although passable enough for those who haven't been reading about Stephen since 1970. But overall, just passable, although the Dormmamu scene was cleverly carried out. I should point out that Mordo is Strange's enemy in the comic books. He is jealous that the Ancient One chose Strange over him, and in fact, Mordo conspires WITH Dormmanu to kill Stephen in the comic books. But never let history stand in the way of a movie, right?
Cumberbatch was a good choice for strange, but his speeches lack the gravity (""Who's laughing now, a**hole?"") WHAT?!?!? That's the language of a 22 year old. Stephen is 45, a little past trendy colloquials popping out of his mouth. Also, the astral self cannot appear in the physical realm (such as when he reveals himself in the operating room to his former colleague).
Gaping plot holes and flaws prevent me from giving it more than a 5, although I can see why others enjoy it: they like the flash and spectacle. Dr. Strange should be much more nuanced and subtle than having the Cape of Levitation pulling him backwards, as though it is sentient (it is not), in a hilarious, Keystone Cops moment.
But take this with a grain of salt. At 70, I've been reading this more than probably 2 or 3 of you combined. Just call me the crusty old curmudgeon - who insists on a more realistic portrayal of a character. To date, ONLY Wonder Woman is COMPLETELY who she is in the comic books. (Well, that's slightly unfair. Iron Man comes close, as does Spider Man, but the Iron Man in the comic books is not nearly as glib as Morton Downey plays him). Thor is a joke (been reading him since I was 12, so...58 years).
But, back to Strange.If you want something to feel supernatural, take a page out of Harry Potter, or Lord of The Rings, and do it RIGHT. This is kiddie stuff splash-the-special-effects-across-the-screen moviemaking. Pedantic, but I grant you, ""entertaining"" as long as you don't know enough about the characters. And I'm not sure I agree that there is much character development. Just moments of gravitas, which is not remotely the same as actual character development (Again, see Wonder Woman for TRUE character development).

","Knowing nothing from the comic books this is a great film and origin story. Dr. Steven Strange plays a Tony Stark sort of character but a little more of an asshole. The first 10 minutes of the film before the accident he's full of himself and has it all. After the accident, he loses it all and goes on the journey to grow and learns many things from the Ancient One played by Tilda Swinton. The Character Development is great, the fighting/magic battles are great and the reality-bending is Amazing! Some flaws in the film (in my opinion) are from the villain and main villain. So Kaecilius played by Mads Mikkelsen was a former student taught by the Ancient one and he went ""rogue"" and learned the dark magic. In the film, he seems to be the main threat which he sort of is until the ending where we see this ""Thing"" BEING come to destroy earth but DR. Strange saves the day using the time gem to do a constant loop of time until the enemy gives in to Strange's demands. So the villains to me weren't great.

","It is no secret that Marvel has capitalized on the popular formula used in the first Iron Man film in some of their most recent efforts. Doctor Strange is a film which follows this principle, yet it still feels fresh and unique. It possesses the arcane weirdness of the Guardians of the Galaxy films, the general story trends of iron man and the same light tone as almost every MCU film. Scott Derickson's clever direction distracts from the formulaic script via the use of mind blowing special effects; perhaps the best we've seen in a Marvel, if not a Superhero film to date. The cast does well with what they are given; Benedict Cumberbatch portrays a charming Stephen Strange, even if his character's personality and arc feel all too familiar. Tilda Swinton, controversially cast as the formerly Asian Ancient one puts in a good stint, and Benedict Wong is gives an amusing performance as his namesake Wong. Chitweiji Elijifor stars as exposition machine Mordo, and whilst his character lacks depth the actor's characterization is well done. Once again however, Marvel have fallen into the trap of fielding an underdeveloped antagonist; Mads Mikkelsen is undoubtedly a terrific actor, but his villain is ultimately forgettable. At the end of the day however, Doctor Strange ticks all the right boxes when it comes to producing a pleasurable cinematic experience; it is well made, acted and directed, is bundles of fun and has excellent special effects (This film makes Inception look tame in comparison).

I think the use of CGI was very visually interesting and entertaining (although this is very usual for Marvel). Really my only criticism is that almost all elements of the plot are straight out of something else. For example, there is a magical ability that only some poses, but there is both an evil and a good side to this magic. There is a very wise teacher on the good side and a violent and corrupt man on the bad side. Doesn't all that sound kind of familiar?

In most Marvel movies, the CGI is used only when necessary, and it's clear that the actors are used in as many scenes as possible, whereas in Dr. Strange, the CGI could be distracting, and made it a bit difficult to suspend disbelief in some of the scenes.

It's true that Cumberbatch does more with this role than anyone could have reasonably expected him to. It's actually a terribly-written character, yet he manages to inject likability into an utterly unlikable person who, played by anyone else, would have been completely insufferable. This is because he's an excellent actor, far too cool and interesting for a movie like this, which is neither of those things. Swinton also is far too cool and interesting for this movie.

","The MCU's gender problems linger in Strange—Rachel McAdams' talents feel wasted playing Strange's love interest, and the movie fails the Bechdel Test in spectacular fashion. But the dominant fear for the universe's Borg-like expansion is how it will continue to add more characters to an already crowded stable. Doctor Strange has memorable, complex characters and action sequences, along with a visual style that sets it apart from the previous 13 Marvel films. If its many team-up movies start to sag under the weight of gratuitous crossovers, at least the studio knows it can do origin stories right. While it's not the action adventure debut some may have been hoping for, Rachel McAdams' role in Doctor Strange does sound like it's fully within her wheelhouse. Presumably, McAdams' professional colleague to Cumberbatch's cocky surgeon would serve as an emotional counterbalance to the awesome powers that Stephen Strange will be dealing with the consequences of in his initial outing. In terms of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, if Doctor Strange is an analogue to Iron Man, then McAdams could be the Pepper Potts in the equation. Of course, seeing as Ant-Man kind of felt like a little bit of an Iron Man retread, those in charge are probably avoiding sharing too many story beats with the already established MCU canon at all costs.",/review/rw3792523/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_(2016

Why was a few minutes not spent emphasizing he was a playboy hot shot surgeon, a flash car and apartment does not cut it, why was a few minutes flashing out the bad guy played by a very underused brilliant actor Mads Mikkelsen why a few minutes not showing avenger(s) in the big boss fight scene being helpless but needing Dr.Strange. It just needed a bit more work, an extra 10 mins would have given much more depth to the characters.

This aspect of humanity could have been used in Doctor Strange but it didn't instead they tried to push the girlfriend narrative which they could have done.

","Dr. Strange is an interesting take on the world of magic when compared to other movies with magic, such as Harry Potter series. While this series have magic as something your are born to do, Dr Strange is a bit different. The movie has a selfish surgeon how loses his money maker hands go on a desperate search for a way to fix what had happened to him, all so he can ""help"" people. However after a discover of a paralyzed man walking perfectly again, Dr. Strange seeks this treatment only to find a world of magic created by all the other worlds that exist. In his selfish attempts to fix himself he discovers a greater evil occurring and begins to help stop the destruction of his world to Dormammu, a creature wishing to make everything part of himself or ""The One"". Benedict Cumberbatch's easy takes the essence of this selfish character and becomes one with it as well as he is able to slowly transform this character over the film. The elements of humor added to some of the more serious moments also helps keep the attention of the viewer as it is unexpected and well written. what I found the most fascinating was the effects used on the movie. All the magic in the movie is created based on the people creating special circles or tomes to summon the magic from the other worlds. while most of the magic was a orange like electricity that's shape would change depending on the spell, other magics where a more translucent in appearance or altered the world itself. The mirror dimension was my personal favorite as the world would be reflected or altered in weird ways where characters could run along walls or create four of the same city in each corner of the screen. These effects were mind boggling and created a unique setting for parts of the movie. Even one of the final scenes of the film took place in an alternative world, created likely by well done CGI that made it seem like all of this could happen. I enjoyed the how all the characters developed and what roles they played in the story, my only complaint would be that Dr. Strange seemed to get strong too fast. In the film they say he was just likely a natural but they still could have had him struggle more in his training. Other than that I am excited to see where they go with this character, especially since they connected his one artifact to the infinity stones, the items connected to the next Thor movie, which was confirmed by Thor's visit to the Doctor at the end of the movie.

","Doctor Strange is a sci-fi/fantasy type of movie. Not only does it include the special effects of magic, but is also part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe which is very much so sci-fi. The special effects are amazing and literally mind blowing. When the characters are in the mirror dimension and distorting space, it is a sight to behold. Buildings collapse in on themselves and other buildings as the city spirals and twists. The story is quite simple. Doctor Steven Strange, an expert surgeon, gets into a car crash that ruins the mobility of his hands. He can no longer do what he loves as a surgeon. He goes through a rough patch seeking treatment after treatment. He learns about this place that helped a paralyzed man recover fully. He finds himself in a place that teaches the mystic arts. He then learns magic and ends up saving the day at the end of the movie. There were many different story lines in the comics that this movie could have taken, but I think they nailed it. The only reason I gave this a nine instead of a ten is because of the way Dormammu was depicted on screen. In the comics and some cartoons, you get to see Doctor Strange's greatest foe, Dormammu. He is typically depicted as a powerful being with a dark head covered in orange-ish yellow-ish flames. In the movie, Dormammu does seem powerful, but his face looks more like blue and purple stripes that constantly shift.

1084,28 November 2016,ryan-03308,8," Another great movie from the marvel universe
","Doctor Strange is the fourteenth film brought to us by Marvel and I have to say it is probably the most daring due to the complexity of it but Scott Derrickson and his team have brought us a great movie here. It is essentially another origin movie and you can guess what is going to happen but I do love the Marvel films, with exception to a few and a lot of people don't agree when i say Iron Man 3 was pretty bad. This movie however doesn't go into a lot of depth involving the characters and goes more for the special effects to amaze the audience. The movie starts with a quick scene introducing Kaecilius (Mikkelsen) stealing a page out of a book owned by The Ancient One (Swinton), there is a fight scene involving a lot of magic and Inception type buildings moving before Kaecilius escapes with the page. Kaecilius is a former student of The Ancient One who has turned evil and is looking to become immortal, he believes the only way to do this is by teaming up with Dormammu, the ruler of the Dark Dimension. We then move to the movies protagonist, the brilliant and arrogant Doctor Stephen Strange, we are shown how brilliant a mind he has while performing surgery and showing off his 70's music knowledge before setting off to save another patients life who has been declared brain dead. With most origin movies the hero usually finds himself after the death of a family member but not with Strange, his family are never mentioned and the only person he was ever close with. Christine Palmer (McAdams) is still alive and working with him. Dr Strange is one of the best neuro surgeons in the world but his life is suddenly turned upside down, paying less attention to the road than he should be he is in a life threatening crash which leaves his hands so damaged he will never perform surgery again. Strange goes into a desperate state of trying everything from stem cell treatment to physiotherapy and spends all the money he has in the process. During a physio session his physio tells him the story of a man who would never be able to walk again and stops going to physio, one day he walks by the same man in the street. Dr Strange doesn't believe this story and the physio shows him the patients files, Strange tracks doen this patient who tells him where he was healed. In a last hope for Strange he sets off and ends up in Kathmandu where he meets Mordo (Ejiofor), he takes Strange to see The Ancient One and this is where the real special effects of the movie kick in, Strange is subjected to an experience that throws him through an experience he can only explain must be caused by LSD, he is thrown through an attack of colours in the screen that will leave you thinking what just happened, not to mention when his hands grow more hands. His training with The Ancient One begins and here there are a few funny scenes with Mordo and the library keeper Wong (Benedict Wong), the jokes and the one liners do keep coming from Strange and Benedict Cumberbatch does a good job of pulling the character off. As the movie goes on Kaecilius attacks and he and Strange end up fighting and here he comes by his Cloak of Levitation, I do like the fact they don't take the film too seriously and joke about things like the cloak. As the movie goes on we are subject to more special effects including an astro projection fight and the introduction of the dark universe and the Dread Dormammu, we learn things about certain characters that will escalate in the sequel and that The Ancient One may not be all she claims. The film does come to a climax with Doctor Strange facing off with Dormammu and bending time and space in a funny but dark way. I did really like this film, it was an origin story that didn't go too much into the depth of the characters, they didn't try and explain why The Ancient One was a woman and not an old Asian man, there is a funny scene at the start when Strange mistakes an old man as the ancient one. Derrickson could also have done more with Mikkelsens character, Mikkelsen is a really good actor and he has proved this but wasn't given much to do in this film. I will hand it to Derrickson and his team though as this was always going to be a hard film to pull off with the effects and the spells and everything else from the Dr Strange comics. I would highly recommend anyone who hasn't already seen this film to go and see it now.",/review/rw3792523/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_(2016

Usually I would never go to a film in 3D but its visuals complement 3D so well. Speaking of the visuals, the visuals are breathtaking. It reminds me very much of Inception or The Matrix. Benedict Cumberbatch is great as Stephen Strange, I can't see anyone else playing the sorcerers supreme. Benedict Wong, Tilda Swinton,Rachel McAdams,and Chiwetel Ejiofor give great performances as well. Like all Marvel films, there is a lot of comedy, but in my opinion this is one the funniest Marvel films yet. Mads Mikkelson's Kaecilius is the villain of the film and like every Marvel villain,they do their usual job of a villain and that's about it. The film felt a bit short. I feel like they could've spent more time fleshing the character of Stephen Strange out in the beginning. Other than those, I have no gripes with the movie.

The movie provides many broad answers to questions we didn't ask. Doctor Strange is not terrible but it feels like the time and dedication spent could've made a product that had a lot more depth. The whole movie felt rushed. Characters never really develop, and when they do it is off screen. Doctor Strange mostly succeeds in the comedy aspect but some jokes are just plain bad or cringey.

There are some film-making flaws in this film that I normally would address, but this movie is so enjoyable, those flaws are ultimately outweighed by how fun watching it is. If you care to hear about the negatives, here they are. Even though the fast pace of the movie is a plus, it can also hurt the film's story sometimes, which is extremely important, and can take away from some of the characters. Yes, the stunning bending and altering of surroundings is enthralling, but it can be a bit overkill. Though that's nit-picky. I am a big movie music guy, and Michael Giacchino's score is somewhat of an awkward mix. It has moments of a very basic Marvel score, and it has moments that almost sound like a mix of medieval, Mexican, rock, and Chinese styles that just don't go well together. Mads Mikkelsen I thought did a great job with his character, but like with all Marvel villains there are funny moments that somewhat take away from the villain. I do want to mention that the humor in Doctor Strange I think is better than most of Marvel films.

","Doctor Strange is a refreshing movie in the marvel cinematic universe, by breaking the stereotypical hero cycle and creating a truly unique hero story. The movie keeps the viewer truly entertained from start to finish with amazing graphics, action set pieces, and stunning plot twists. The truly reinvigorating aspect of this movie is how different this movie than other superhero movies, Marvel studios ditched the guns and explosions and instead to a more mystical approach. While this is a mostly stand- alone movie it definitely builds upon the notions of the fabulously crafted marvel universe with references to the movies that have come before it. Throughout the movie Steven Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is skeptical of the of the world around him as well as his journey and the paths he chooses to overcome not only his paralysis but his ego. After he is unable to operate due to a car accident, Steven desperately turns to a magical sorcerer to help find his meaning in life. Benedict Cumberbatch did a fantastic job of embodying the iconic comic book character Dr. Strange. Although his American accent took time to get used to it did not impede his performance. Benedicts performance allowed the view to feel the sheer pain and struggle as well as triumph that Steven Strange exudes throughout the movie. The makeup and costume design team did a fantastic job at making Benedict have a truly uncanny resemblance to Steven strange in the comics. Tilda Swinton's take on the ancient one was original yet true to the comics, her performance was captivating. The major criticism I have for the movie is the lack of character development of the villains Dormammu and Kaecilius, the movie doesn't explore enough of characters' background to make them truly horrifying. Marvel studios showed off the full potential of their graphics team with truly mind- bending visuals throughout the movie. Dr. Strange has also been nominated for an Oscar in best achievement in visual effects. The visual effects of this movie are best describe as combination of Inception and Rick and Morty. They had a healthy balance of practical and digital effects. The director used the visual effects to continue the story, for instance in one scene Steven is having a vision of hands grabbing drowning him, showing if he continues to worry about what he can't do with his hand paralysis it will be his downfall. The costume and set design was fantastic with many Easter eggs and winks at the comics throughout the movie.",/review/rw3792523/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_(2016

","Doctor Strange is a visually appealing ""superhero birth"" film that introduces another wise-cracking hero and a new universe to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Ultimately, the film owes its strengths to dazzling special effects, interesting characters, and well written dialogue. The overall story is pretty good, but clearly follows the ingredients and chronology of Marvel's origin story recipe. In other words, if you're familiar with many of Marvel's recent films, the Doctor Strange narrative won't present many surprises. ",/review/rw3792523/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_(2016

","I love how Doctor Strange was an amazing movie and entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, what was totally amazing was Benedict Cumberbatch's acting as Doctor Strange with his arrogance and pride and later a confident disciple of Kamar-Taj also I loved Stephen's costume look and everything and powers, I also loved Mads Mikkelsen's look as Kaecilius and acting and how Kaecilius doesn't want to end this world and expire but wants to save it in an misunderstood way with Dormammu, Chiwetel Ejiofor's acting was extraordinary as Karl Mordo with his powers and like a sidekick to Strange and also his betrayal of the Mystic Arts and the end of Doctor Strange (2016). Rachel McAdams' portrayal as Christine Palmer was amazing and a great love interest to Doctor Stephen Strange and amazing Doctor. Benedict Wong's acting of Wong is funny, mind- blowing and amazing! with his looks and stuff Wong will be a big entry into the MCU as he is coming in Infinity War with Doctor Strange. Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One was interesting as her teaching to Strange was understanding and her death was what completed her life as she agreed for her death. The Astral Plane fight between Lucian portrayed by Scott Adkins and Doctor Strange was an amazing look from the comics and a great prestige from Scott Derrickson, now the amazing visuals of the film were amazing and was 150 times greater than Inception, and what was surprising was that Doctor Strange actor: Benedict Cumberbatch played the motion capture which is amazing that Benedict is playing a hero and a villain in the same film which is interesting. Marvel Studios' 2016 Doctor Strange Stars: Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams, Benedict Wong, Michael Stuhlbarg, Scott Adkins, Benjamin Bratt and with Mads Mikkelsen and Tilda Swinton and also with an surprising cameo with Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Doctor Strange is Directed by: Scott Derrickson and is now on Blu-Ray, DVD and Digital HD.",/review/rw3792523/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_(2016
