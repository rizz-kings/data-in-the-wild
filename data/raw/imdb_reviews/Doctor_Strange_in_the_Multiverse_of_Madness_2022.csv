0,14 May 2022,briancham1994,7," This was Wandavision 2, not Doctor Strange 2
","I liked this movie and I think it's a fine addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It has the distinct directorial style of Sam Raimi with some quirky camera choices, horror elements and quick montages. The fight scenes and magic are more creative than in previous films, such as the musical battle. The visual design of the universes are very distinct and feels like other worlds have really come to life. It was very exciting to explore other worlds and other versions of Dr. Strange. Scarlet Witch has a truly terrifying presence.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

","So, carrying on from WandaVision, Wanda continues her arc as a slaver who faces no consequences for enslaving a town full of people to now being a mass-murdering slaver who risks the lives of trillions of people's lives, destroys universes, enslaves more people, so she can murder a child, which will help her switch her plan to murder a mother and kidnap her imaginary children.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

","Sam Raimi definitely put a splash of horror in this action film. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is darker & more violent than any previous MCU movie, which could be considered a strength. However, I felt like there was not enough multiverse and maybe too much madness. Despite the entertaining visuals, the plot is fairly chaotic, and the acting & dialogue are inconsistent. This movie is an entertaining ride, but it's a little too messy to stand on its own.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

The score by Danny Elfman works really well and clearly makes you feel it's not the usual MCU flair. But that alone doesn't make it a better film than those that follow such tropes.

66,5 May 2022,aidanratesmovies,9," Elizabeth Olson and Raimi shine in a fun and exciting sequel
","Being a huge fan of the first Doctor Strange film, one that definitely didn't get enough attention in my opinion, and legendary director Sam Raimi- it was clear to me that Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was gonna be one hell of a ride- and thank god it was. The film is rather loose with its story, but it also provides a anti-typical narrative that does prove to be quite interesting and quite different than the usual Marvel schlock we have come to see from more recent films like Black Widow- though never being as pretentious or lengthy as Marvel Eternals. Where Multiverse of Madness works and the other fails, is its ability to take its audience fully into the insane experience at hand, never letting go for a second and devoting its all to every crazy moment it can. The acting is great, as I expected, Benedict Cumberbatch is again great as Doctor Strange- but even with him being the titular character- it's very clear that Elizabeth Olson as Wanda or ""The Scarlet Witch"" is clearly the biggest standout in the film altogether. Olson ties the film together in a way I didn't expect, and ties the film to a rather emotional and psychological core that is sure to please all fans of her character and devoted fans of the show WandaVision. In addition to Olson and Cumberbatch, the supporting cast also does great, especially newcomer Xochitl Gomez and the returning Rachel McAdams. The cameos can be a bit underwhelming, nothing too special or grand as some other projects. The visuals are often incredible, and thanks to Raimi's signature style- brilliantly dark and even gothic at times- and the special effects are often fun and vibrant- although it is quite silly to see that half done photoshopped eye on Doctor Strange a few times. The music is honestly fantastic, a brilliant score from genius Danny Elfman, both haunting and exciting in the best possible way. In the end, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness may not be as even or brilliant as the original- but it does a great job of enrapturing us in new worlds and embracing us in grand new ways with the characters we have grown to love- and some new ones as well.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

I liked his characterization, and even thought he was good in his appearance in the last couple Avengers movies. Sadly, with Multiverse of Madness (and a few things that came before it) I'm starting to think that the MCU is becoming more like the comics and there will be times that I won't want to run out and pay to see the movies, but I will instead wait for crossover appearances to catch up on the activities of these less interesting characters.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

The movie had some elements of horror that were executed well, but only a few. Don't. Get. Me. Started. On. Zombie Strange. It was so dumb, we went from elements that were genuinely bone chilling, to some weird Hallmark-ation of a zombie. Like him giving a pep talk? It felt way to corny and out of place. Eternals may have been quite boring but at least the plot went in a clear direction, and the cinematography was actually good.

With the multiverse and horror elements in this film as well as Sam Rami's directing style, this film brings us a MCU film unlike anything we have seen before. Benedict Cumberbatch was magnificent as always as Doctor Strange bringing us a side of the character we have not yet seen before. Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda/Scarlett Witch was absolutely terrifying in every way possible and was definitely the standout character in the film. Benedict Wong as Wong is definitely the comic relief of the film also bringing us humor when it was needed. Xochitl Gomez as America Chavez brings us a very interesting character that is a great new addition to the MCU and I can't wait to see more of her. I also loved every bit of the cameos we got in this movie too and it helped make the film feel more multiversal. If I have any cons about this movie, it's I wish this movie was about 20 minutes longer and maybe a couple more cameos in this movie than they already had.

And soon other beings begin seeking America. Madness would be the best way to describe this film for both better and worst. The movie within its limits does not hold back from its visuals, action, and Gore It throws a lot at you. The Locations are interesting although there are some realities that when you see them it feels as though you wish you got to see slightly more of those locations. The story does fall apart in many areas there are plot holes where it is clear that doing the multiverse has opened up some recons. In many ways, it feels cluttered in some parts. The tone in many ways feels like a Raimi film when it's said that this is not like the rest of the MCU it's not that far off. There are some things that kids might be able to handle. While you do get the typical Jokes it is not as Forumulalic. Yes, there's a villain and yes the overall goal is to stop the villain. The Action is intense, fast, and Bloody Old PG-13 Style Bloody. The amount of Death that Follows in this Film and How Brutal some of it is Executed. Combine with horror Elements, when it is Raimi putting his vision to the screen. It's here where the film is at its best, when the movie starts to pull away that's where it loses some of its appeal. It might not feel in line with the rest of the MCU you, but it does feel more in line with Doctor Strange. Where sometimes it is bright and colorful, but also has its more grim occult Morbid. The cast themselves Benedict Cumberbatch of course is just as great as always He embodies this character While still having much of that Charm. Although he is downplayed a bit. The whole time people are just judging him saying he's an idiot and he is at fault at the time. And moments where he is just gullible. Wong is Good though he has his problems. Elizabeth Olsen quite possibly has the best performance in the film. Let's just say that they don't puss out with her. The whole plot with American Chavez would seem like if you were going to introduce this character this would probably be the best to put her. While She is not in the way and thrown in the background. Why? Really out of all the characters could introduce you to go with this one. You didn't really need her Stephen and Wanda would have been enough. And Mordo is just there.

","'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness' for the most part continues the MCU's lackluster continuation following the creative peak of 'Avengers Endgame'. Each MCU movie has to convince us it has a need to exist as its own entity and that it has surprises and hints of what lies ahead. There is a lot to like here visually and stylistically. Kevin Feige thankfully largely lets Sam Raimi do what Sam Raimi does best. This feels more like 'Evil Dead' than even his 'Spider-Man' films did and so the fans of vintage Raimi are going to crack a smile. The problem I guess with the movie is that as a piece of universe building, 'Multiverse' is an inept venture that is way overhyped and feels inorganic as a story piece.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

","There's something off about pretty much every aspect of 'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022)'. In fact, it doesn't even feel like a film. Nobody seems as though they're in the same room, several of the actors clearly don't want to be there, the editing is often bizarrely choppy, the story is all over the place (and usually feels more like an excuse to include various cameos, callbacks and sequel teases than an actual narrative), the attempts at character development are superficial, and - despite some compellingly creepy and gooey imagery - the visuals often look like something straight out of 'The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2004)'. A lot of the movie amounts to blatant exposition, most of which is only relevant to previous or upcoming films, and this stuff is pretty much always genuinely boring. When things do kick into gear, the action is generally disjointed and floaty. The most satisfying moments occur when a couple of characters go hand-to-hand, likely because you can tell that two people were actually in the same room at the time of filming, but most of what's supposed to be exciting simply falls flat. That's largely due to the fact that the characters are all so dull that it's hard to care about any of them. There are attempts at creating depth here and there, but these feel so tacked-on that the majority aren't even thematically relevant and their eventual conclusions inspire nothing more than a sigh. Benedicts Cumberbatch and Wong are as enjoyable as ever under the circumstances, while Elizabeth Olsen does her best with material that by-and-large butchers her character. Almost all of the fewer-than-anticipated cameos amount to throwaway gags performed by people who sound like they read their lines for the first time just moments before the camera started rolling and, in some cases, aren't even wearing an actual costume (this parody is legitimately better than the cameos it's based on). The best walk-on part is that of an old friend of the Raimi family and even that's a total non sequitur that's only enjoyable due to its blatant absurdity. Apparently, the story was in constant flux (no surprise given the picture's heavily-reported reshoots) and the ending was figured out halfway through production. In all honesty, it shows; this flick is one heck of a mess. I mean, this review is more structured and it's little more than an agitated ramble. Though Raimi manages to sneak in some enjoyable direction every once in a while, the majority of the piece is bland and intangible. Plus, outside of a brief montage showcasing a variety of increasingly ludicrous - and therefore interesting - universes, the picture takes place in the most basic alternate realities imaginable, completely wasting its premise in the process. The movie's enigmatically schlocky title totally oversells the actual affair, as there's very little madness to this particular multiverse. Really, the experience is totally outshone by 'Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse (2018)', in terms of both visuals and narrative. Heck, even 'Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021)', a feature that suffers from some of the same problems as this, blows it out of the water, primarily because it remembers to attach actual characters to its cameos and ensures that even its most surface-level references are enjoyable to some degree. I feel a bit sorry for Raimi, actually; he swapped the studio meddling of Sony for the studio stifling of Marvel. Given the chance, I'm fairly confident he could come up with a weird and wonderful take on the eponymous character and his escapades through an infinite amount of alternate realities. Marvel still isn't letting their directors do their own thing, though. No matter how hard they try to hide it, there's no mistaking the calculated hand of Kevin Feige pulling the strings. As I mentioned up top, 'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022)' doesn't even feel like a real film. Instead, it plays like a checklist of things nobody asked for. It admittedly gets more entertaining as it goes along and there are a handful of sequences which are appropriately Raimi-esque. These scenes, which mostly deal in horror-infused action, can be fairly fun (notably those towards the end of the affair). Plus, the lead actors lend credence to the generally weak (and occasionally terrible) screenplay. However, the film's all-too-brief best moments are still hampered by some seriously iffy editing and the fact that the narrative typically fails to do anything even remotely engaging. Also, like in the similarly disappointing 'Eternals (2021)', the insipid post-credits scenes are blatant parodies of themselves. The whole thing just stinks of wasted potential, really. Surely there's a much better version of this somewhere in the multiverse of our own, but sadly we'll never get to see it.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

","If you pay close enough attention you'll be able to follow the story line in this picture, but why do the filmmakers make it such a chore? The idea of a multiverse is prone to having essentially the same character appearing on other Earths or other dimensions with slight or even major variations, so keeping up with them all can be a little trying if not confusing. I didn't have this much trouble with 2016's original ""Doctor Strange"", even if you had to take it on faith that the picture's treatment of astral projection, temporal manipulation and mirror dimensions can be translated into the real world. In this one, you have to ask the same question Dorothy did in ""The Wizard of Oz""; is Wanda Maximoff's (Elizabeth Olsen) alter-ego a good witch or a bad witch? Seems like she can be both at the same time, just not in the same place. Here on this Earth, we have the lowly presence to only be Number 616 in the Multiverse concept, while much of the action takes place on Earth 838. That idea alone makes you wonder what the heck might be going on in hundreds of other worlds while things are getting sorted out in this one. Which means that there's an endless supply of characters and situations that can be conjured up on the fly to keep the multiverse concept going on forever, and I did like the way the concept was handled in ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"". Here, among the astounding special effects it just felt forced and in need of a more cohesive rewrite. In any event, be assured that this is not the end of the Dr. Strange franchise, as the first credits insert scene hints at another Doc Strange pairing with Wong (Benedict Wong), while the final one following the endless list of names associated with the making of the movie almost gleefully announces the fact that ""It's over""!",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

","I went to see the movie on the morning (10 am) of the 4th of May and waited two days before making a review in order to see what other people tought of the movie. I was surprised in seeing how many people actually disliked the movie. I get that people have different likings but if you hated the movie because it did not give you an absurd amount of cameos then you shouldn't have overhyped it. I will avoid making spoilers but we got 7 cameos in the movie: 1 in the post credit, 3 normal ones during the movie and 3 massive ones that made canon to the MCU 3 different groups. This is enough cameos for one movie. As for the movie itself I was glued to my seat the whole time, from beginning to end. I would have prefered the original cut of the movie but Marvel needed to reshoot things in order to be able to let kids watch the movie. Same treatment both Morbius and Venom got. Nontheless the movie was able to be dark and violent (if you've seen the movie you know I'm talking about one scene in particular). Another thing I see people complain about were the mothers of America Chavez. I do not care if you dislike LGBT or what, you do you, but hating a movie for a 30 seconds scene it's absurd. I almost forgot,you don't need to see Wandavision before this movie. You will understand things even if you haven't seen it but watching it would make things more clear about Scarlet Witch motivations. On the last note I really liked the music in this movie and loved how you got to see it tie togheter to the visual in some scenes.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

They didn't hold back at all Sam really did a great job putting his expert horror style into this! The cast was incredibly! Gomez as America Chavez is undoubtedly going to be one of the huge faces of marvel in the future she did an amazing job and made the character impossible not to like and root for! Olsen of course played the scarlet witch as expected making her horrifying in every second of the film! And of course Dr strange showcasing his raw power and his true kindness that not everyone sees, he might be one of the most hubris heroes but his genuine concern and protection of America Chavez showed why he is a true hero!!! The Illuminati scene was insane and easily showed the raw massive power that the scarlet witch holds. The only only thing I would change would be to make it 30 min to 1hour longer! It was so packed with non stop action and story telling I feel like more time would've allowed to give a little more and a little less of a bit rushed ending!

This movie had some things I didn't think I'd see in a marvel film but before I talk about that I will say Elizabeth Olsen stole the entire film! Okay so the violence in this film was something that blew me away, not only did someone's head get exploded but someone got cut in half and a neck snapped. Mr Fantastic was amazing to see as he was fan cast for ages but didn't see much of his powers which I can only assume they are waiting for the fantastic four film but still would've been nice to see. Captain Carter was badass to see in live action until her demise which was like damn... but then Professor X who was very exciting to see and I am an X Men fan so seeing Wanda snap his neck shocked the hell out of me! Basically Wanda absolutely obliterated everyone! She made a great villain but also brought all the emotion over from Wandavision to the screen and made me feel for her character even more. I am definitely more of a simp for Wanda now. Chavez in the film was alright to me she was like just there for now. What I liked most about doctor strange in the film was to see more of his abilities that we didn't get to see especially in no way home. Whilst I wish we explored more of the multiverse and spent more time in different universes it was a good film and I also wanted more cameos from older films but I assume from the post credits we will delve more into it and open up the possibility for more characters.

It is however, very important to keep your expectations in check. This movie is NOT a cameo fest, it's mainly focused on Strange and Wanda with Wong and Chavez playing an important part in the story as well. The pacing of this movie isn't great, it moves too quickly and could've benefitted from a longer runtime. I also think the ''multiverse'' aspect is really minimal. The multiverse is barely explored and I can't help but feel that many opportunities have been missed. Everything we do get to see on screen though is exciting and thrilling, this movie has quite some horror and gory aspects to it which I enjoyed but they might not be for everyone. This movie has a slim story, pacing that is too rapid but exciting moments and characters you can't get enough of.

It seems a future Earth group of superhero's is keeping track of all the multiverses that Dr Stange has had an effect. Strange and Wong work together to protect America from the Scarlett Witch played by Elizabeth Olsen. I didn't understand how Dr Strange did not know Wanda had turned evil. I mean Strange knew which instance the Avengers would be able to defeat Thanos but yet he couldn't foresee this situation, come on. The whole movie dragged and it was not crisp, the editing was off and the special effects were very cartoonish. Few reasons I gave a little higher score was from the cameos by Chiwetel Ejifor as Baron Mordo, Hayley Atwell as Captain Carter, John Krazinski as Stretch, and Patrick Stewart reprising his role as Professor X. From all the marvel movies ever made I got to say this was the worst.

Doctor Strange is far from the weakest entry but it's not as distinctive when compared to the rest of the expansive Marvel library. The Multiverse of Madness brings back many of the original's same characters and boasts similar action set pieces, but I was pleased by how much I could see Raimi's fingerprints on the stylistic choices. I know some critics complained about how this movie didn't push the envelope further but I thought they struck a nice balance of taking a relaxing dip as opposed to cannonballing into the pool. Between some of the more offbeat humour, the camera angles to the more horror-style pacing and action, the creative team walked a fine line. But I think they included enough to court those looking for something more akin to Raimi's zany previous works. I was also surprised at how violent some of the movie's scenes got.

","With ""Multiverse of Madness"" I have the official confirmation that Marvel does not know what is doing with this fourth MCU phase. After all these movies and TV shows focused on this concept, this should have been the film that would finally express a cohesive vision behind it. I mean, the title speaks by itself. Instead, we have some kind of auto celebrative production that throws around characters from unrelated narratives such as Charles Xavier or Reed Richards, that do not add any depth to the story. Seems that Marvel just fished randomly in the huge vastness of their superheroes roster, and inserted them in the script, just because they can. Obviously, there was no proper thinking while the creators were writing. The whole setup is just unbelievably bad. I don't know who this America Chavez is, and the plot does not give any background about her, except for a very short and ineffective flashback that comes way too late in the movie. Therefore, I never perceived any danger for her, never rooted for or against her. She seemed more like a side character, with the purpose to fill a bit a few minutes of plot, except she is in fact the protagonist and the whole movie turns around her salvation from the bad guy. Not to mention that the acting skills of Xochitl Gomez are average to say the least.

Sam Raimi provides some nice touches with more than a few nods to the Evil Dead series and Wanda is giving the chance to shine and be the all powerful that she is. Surprisingly i thought the movie was stronger before they travelled to the multiverse, once there the movie is a bit all over the place. The cameos were slightly disappointing, i thought The Suicide Squad doing the whole 'kill off the secondary superhero group thing' worked better. As a big Sam Raimi fan i am surprised this one left me cold but it just didn't do it for me, even the run time is fairly short and i was still clock watching.

","20 years ago, horror director Sam Raimi released his first true superhero movie, Spider-Man, to critical and succesfull acclaim, followed by two sequels which did quite well for him so much that he went back to horror movies again through his company Ghost House Pictures. Since then, Marvel decided to create a universe where characters would interact with each other in serialized movies which resulted in the MCU. 10 years ago, that culminated in the biggest team up ever...The Avengers, which at the time had the highest opening weekend for a tentpole movie in May and had legs. Flash forward to 2022, and the Avengers have broken up, and we got Doctor Strange in a multiverse of madness, where he will face many foes and new friends. In order to understand this, watch Wandavision, What If, and the preceding movies. Be sure to stay after the end for some cool bonus scenes.

","First, the basics: Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness details Strange's mission to protect America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez), a young girl with the ability the travel between dimensional realities. America has two problems: she can't control her ability, and she's being hunted by someone who wants to steal her powers for their own gain. It's not long before the movie reveals her pursuer is none other than Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen), the former Avenger and current Scarlet Witch, who is desperate to reunite with the children she magically willed into being in WandaVision. Wanda has learned that her children actually do exist in every other universe except for the one she lives in and becomes determined to slide into another universe where she can reunite with her children. Those who have become attached to Wanda the beloved Avenger and didn't like her darker turn in WandaVision should be warned: She goes full Daenerys-Targaryen-in-the-last-season-of-Game-of-Thrones evil in this movie, as she attempts to achieve her goal at all costs. By the time you get to Multiverse of Madness's first post-credits scene, Charlize Theron (presumably playing the sorceress and future Strange love interest Clea) is ripping a doorway into Strange's reality and asking him to go on further adventures. During the Infinity Saga, these extra scenes were often made up of small breadcrumbs that almost subtly hinted at where the films would go next. Now they're just a giant movie star showing up to play a character general audiences probably don't know who might become an Avenger six years down the road. (See also: Harry Styles in Eternals.) There's no longer anything subtle about it. Sure, you'd get more out of this movie if you revisited the original Doctor Strange and WandaVision before watching. (I didn't say the connectivity was completely gone!) But it honestly might be better to forget about the film's many Easter eggs, enjoy a bunch of Sam Raimi flourishes (of which there are many), and appreciate the fact that Feige gave the thumbs-up to an MCU movie that features multiple jump scares, demons galore, and Strange magically possessing the dead body of...himself.

","As the credits roll, the first thought that came to mind after seeing Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness, is how creative the MCU filmmakers really are. With 26 predecessors, the second Strange film remains almost original due to its dark and suspenseful undertones. The use of ominous music, dread drenched imagery and the unfiltered & ""gruesome"" outcomes, offers a new and unique experience which is something to behold. Don't get me wrong however, as this is still an MCU film therefore, you are in store for top of the class action and for me, this is where the film shines the brightest. Here, Magic is the name of the game and the film features ONE OF THE BEST visual effects & scores I have ever seen. The battle scenes and jumps across multiverses was captivating and immersive. What comes next is unpredictable and exciting, proof of unlimited creative juices from our filmmakers. That musical battle...

I will admit it does suffer as a bit of a downgrade from the first film due Scarlet Witch being a weak villain in this film even from her backstory. But the execution was able to take up for it with a solid story, great action, some of the good characters that give the events what we will see for the rest of the saga (which I won't spoil), and visuals that are strange in the best kind of way. Even though it's not as awesome as the first film, this would be a great idea to watch this to see what the Multiverse is like and what to expect what we will being seeing for this generation. After watching this, I should watch WandaVision someday. Seeing her in this film, I can tell the character has changed into a powerful one and I was starting to become curious how.

If this would have been structured as a 'Strange and Wanda explores the multiverse'-kind of plot, we most likely would have seen a much more interesting take on Wandas descent into madness, more worthwhile cameos and possibly a better depiction of how Strange was a considerable threat to the multiverse.

606,8 January 2023,dalyons-09311,5," Great Visuals With Poor Character Planning
","I usually don't like doing spoiler reviews, but you can't talk about this one without talking about Wanda. The first Doctor Strange is one of my favorite MCU entries, so I was really excited for this one. To some extent, it did not disappoint, with the music and visuals being quite strong, though it's a bit disappointing that the most ""madness"" they could think of was that red means go. Unfortunately, whereas the first Doctor Strange told a great story about an arrogant man realizing that, even as a superhero, he doesn't have to be the hero, this movie gets pretty much every character arc wrong and, as a result, completely botches the ending. As a brief aside, the Illuminati is an issue. Spider-Man: No Way Home made as much money as it did not because it included Garfield and Maguire, but because in wove them into the story and made their inclusion meaningful. Not only is their wisdom useful for Holland's Peter to learn how to grow, but by being in the movie they get to advance their own character arcs, with Garfield in particular earning a redemption. Clearly the MCU's interpretation of that was ""more cameos good"" because Multiverse of Madness contains a variety of pointless cameos that have little significance. Patrick Stewart's Professor X is one of the most beloved movie characters ever, so underusing him is a crime. The other characters are less of an issue but still annoying. Their inclusion is a tease rather than satisfying fan service. The first character issue is Wong. Wong was comic relief in the first movie, and when he was Sorcerer Supreme in No Way Home, it was kind of funny but kind of weird. She-Hulk cements his status as comic relief. He's nowhere near supreme level. Still, in No Way Home he was shown to be the responsible one. In Multiverse of Madness, he's completely useless, so why anyone wouldn't instantly promote Steven is beyond me. From a movie perspective, that makes sense. It's a Doctor Strange movie, not a Wong movie. But from a character perspective, it turns this whole sorcerer thing into a joke, which it really shouldn't be. The intrigue of the mystic arts in the first movie was a big part of what made it good, so making it stupid is a bad idea. Steven and Christine have no real character progression. It's just a bunch of people asking him if he's happy. Christine's comment about him needing to be the one with the knife is ridiculous considering what he did in the whole Dormammu sequence. The biggest issue, though, is Wanda. After WandaVision 4, I was so excited because the prospect of them taking Wanda and making her a villain was so interesting. Spending multiple movies with someone on the light side and then slowly turning them to the dark side is exactly the kind of bold move that Phase 4 needs. But instead, the MCU is trying to make Wanda sympathetic and good, trying to convince us that she's redeemed herself or something. I don't respect that lack of commitment. It's, as Breaking Bad would say, a half measure. WandaVision basically starts with Wanda's grief overcoming her, and in her corrupted attempts to be happy, she enslaves a town. By the end of the series, she learns that what she did was wrong, accepts her loss, and moves on. That works. I don't love WandaVision, but it works. What doesn't work is then immediately having her be the villain again in Multiverse of Madness, with her grief and anger once again making her evil. What was the point of WandaVision? They've rendered an entire Disney+ show useless. That flip flopping is not believable. Don't give her a redemption arc if she's not going to be redeemed. I actually think Multiverse of Madness before WandaVision would've worked, but more on that in a bit. With Wanda, it's like they did the stages of grief in reverse. She starts in depression, then goes back to denial with Westview, then goes to acceptance by the end, and finally goes back to anger and bargaining with Multiverse of Madness. It's so weird and doesn't make any sense. The planning with Wanda's character arc was not nearly as meticulously crafted as Tony Stark's. The last character they screwed up is Chavez. For starters, she's completely forgettable. I don't know if she's going to be in any future movies, but she's not very interesting. She's just kind of there. Now for the ending of the movie...it's lazy. For starters, the answer is for Chavez to believe in herself. Really? They couldn't come up with anything more creative? But more importantly, halfway through the movie, Wong tells Wanda that the kids have their own mother taking care of them, and that she should be satisfied with that. She says no. Then the ending of the movie? She stops because she becomes satisfied with the fact that they'll have their own mother taking care of them. What? She just said no to that! Even the movie thinks its ending is stupid. It makes no sense. Again, they were so focused on Wanda redeeming herself (again) that they weren't considering what made sense for the character.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

","The people that follow my blog have probably noticed that I'm again watching all of the films by Marvel Studios in order. This is my third time doing this. I began doing this by accident and out of curiosity at the end of March, mostly to see how well the films from Phase One of the MCU fare against subsequent films in the MCU. The films from Phase One are a little special to me because I got to see them in theaters at a time when I began going to theaters more often than I had before. Moreover, I saw these films in theaters that no longer exist. One of these theaters was called Empire Granville 7 Cinemas and the other was called Cineplex Cinemas Esplanade. Seeing a film in these theaters definitely added to the enjoyment of seeing a film because their auditoriums were built in the old style and their decor was appealing. For example, I remember that after I finished watching Captain America: The Winter Soldier, which is one of the best films in the MCU, in one of the auditoriums of Cineplex Cinemas Esplanade, in the spring of 2014, I came out to the well-designed foyer on the second floor and stopped to look around for several minutes and to look through the large windows at the scenery outside. It was sunny and warm outside, the trees were blooming, and the strong sunlight was beaming through the windows of the foyer. So, I took a moment to stand in the sunlight and enjoy the view. There were also no people around me at that time. The closure of the two theaters saddened me. Cineplex Cinemas Esplanade was the last one that was closed, in 2019. Since then, I haven't been going to theaters as often as I had before because the experience was no longer the same. The theaters that got built in the 2000s are simply bland. At that time, I also finally came to the conclusion that movie studios in the West can't make films as competently as they did before the 2000s. Almost all of the films that got made after the 1990s have no replay value. Anyway, I got to see all of the films from Phase One for the first time in theaters. I remember in which theater I saw each film, what the weather was like on that day, and even what happened on that day. I got to see Iron Man (2008), the first film from Phase One, at Cineplex Cinemas Esplanade. This is also where I got to see The Incredible Hulk (2008) a little later on. Of course, at that time, I had no idea what the people at Marvel Studios were planning, that they had an idea of creating a cinematic universe. The film from Phase One that I liked seeing the most at that time is Thor (2011). It's still my favorite film from Phase One. Admittedly, it's not the best film from Phase One. That honor goes to Iron Man or The Avengers (2012). But it is my favorite because I got to see it in my favorite theater, Empire Granville 7 Cinemas, on a sunny day, at the end of spring. And the films featuring Thor have remained some of my favorite films from the MCU ever since. I still get excited when I see the Bifrost travel sequence in the first Thor film. There's also the fact that I like the characters, the action, the music, and the comedy in this film. I'd like to point out that I like all of the films that got made by Marvel Studios. I don't consider any of them to be bad. I like seeing some of them more than others, but I consider all of them to be enjoyable. I know that I criticized Avengers: Endgame (2019), but I still like this film a lot. Perhaps the film that stood out the most to me this time is Iron Man 2 (2010). I like it more now than I used to. There are some really neat touches in this film. The MK V armor is my favorite Iron Man armor. It looks fantastic. The comedy in Iron Man 2 is quite effective. Sam Rockwell, in particular, is very funny in some scenes. The dialogue is good and so is the action, especially the fight at the end involving Black Widow. The only letdown is the music, which isn't very memorable, but this isn't a big problem. One thing that I have noticed when seeing the films from Phase One again is that they're not geared toward children as much as the films from Phase Four. The films from Phase One are more serious and edgy than subsequent MCU films. They even contain a few horror elements. The Incredible Hulk, in particular, contains a few scenes that can be called scary. I think that after Marvel Studios got acquired by Walt Disney Studios in 2015, MCU films began to be geared mostly toward children, and the typical Disney messages began to appear in MCU films. The one film so far where this is most obvious is Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings (2021). I enjoyed seeing this film, but not as much as I thought I would. The film is clearly geared toward children because it features many cute mythological creatures and childish comedy. At times, it even seemed like a Disney animated film because of all of the CGI action and characters in colorful costumes. Even the presence of Tony Leung Chiu-wai, who looks good as usual, and the cool-looking rings can't distract from how lightweight this film is at times. But I've got to say that the return of Trevor Slattery was a welcome surprise. Moreover, the short All Hail The King (2014), in which this fake Mandarin appears again, is a must-see film, as I've recently discovered because I've never seen it before. I enjoyed watching Black Widow (2021) and Eternals (2021) about as much as Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings. These films are good, but they're not my favorite MCU films. I like Scarlett Johansson's performance in Black Widow and I like the action. Natasha Romanoff is much more appealing as a character in this film than in any of the previous MCU films. In Eternals, I like the CGI and I like the action. When it comes to characters in this film, I think that the character interactions are hit or miss. The big surprise of Phase Four for me so far was Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021). I waited to see this film on home video because I couldn't go to a theater when it was released in theaters. It's because vaccine mandates were still in effect at that time. The films in the MCU featuring Peter Parker as the main character have never been my favorites. They're good, but they just don't click with me as well as other films in the MCU. May Parker, played by Marisa Tomei, is not an interesting or appealing character at all in the Spider-Man films. She didn't have much screen time anyway. Tom Holland was the right age to play Peter Parker, but he's not all that good in the role. Tobey Maguire remains the best Peter Parker for me because he's a better actor. Anyway, while Tobey is as good as ever in Spider-Man: No Way Home, the real surprise is Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker. Andrew delivered a very appealing performance, and he's better in this film than in the two awesome (terrible) Spider-Man films that he starred in. I mean, in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014), Paul Giamatti delivered a simply majestic performance as the Rhino. How can you top that? So, the inclusion of the three Peters and the fact that their friendship was filmed well elevated this film to my favorite film of Phase Four so far and to the best Spider-Man film in the MCU so far. But this is how I felt before Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness (2022) was released in theaters. I got to see Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness several days ago. I can easily say that this film is now my favorite film of Phase Four so far. The reason why this is the case is because I enjoyed watching it from beginning to end. The previous films in Phase Four, even Spider-Man: No Way Home, were hit or miss for me. But Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness isn't only a feast for the eyes from beginning to end. It also features good performances from Benedict Cumberbatch, Elizabeth Olsen, Benedict Wong, and Rachel McAdams. Some critics criticized the inclusion of the Illuminati, but I actually enjoyed seeing this group of superheroes. I found Earth-838 to be very appealing visually. Even the Earth of the destroyed universe looks incredible. By the way, Olsen, who plays Scarlet Witch, looks better in this film than in any other film in which she has appeared. Her makeup and costume look perfect. Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness is by no means a perfect film. The plot and the characters can be criticized. America Chavez didn't have to appear in this film, and she was included only as a way of finally introducing this character in the MCU. But I don't expect to see The Godfather (1972) or Gandhi (1982) when I go to see a film by Marvel. Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness is simply an entertaining, delightful, and well-directed film, and this is good enough for me. So, while Phase Four has suffered somewhat from interference by Disney, I don't think that MCU films are bad now. For example, Spider-Man: No Way Home and Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness have become some of my favorite MCU films.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

","I don't care if this movie has ""jump scares"" or ""more darkness than the average Marvel movie"". This is a superhero film. Marvel exclusively makes superhero films.

The plot tries too hard to not be predictable to the point where it leads right back where you thought it was going to go. The few minutes of expected MCU fan service are absolutely redundant to the plot as it helps establish how powerful wanda is, which is already shown beforehand.

","This film was full of surprises. Sam Raimi did a terrific job combining suspense, horror and comedy to this Marvel entry.

It was a bold move to make Scarlet Witch a villain following Wanda Maximoff's popularity in WandaVision, and simulating her self-sacrificial death (is she really dead? I don't think so!), so I have to hand it to the writers. I was worried about Marvel's foray into mysticism, because I didn't like Moon Knight very much.

","The first Doctor Strange movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe was fantastic, and his appearance in Spider-Man: No Way Home was terrific, so I was excited for the next instalment, directed by Sam Raimi (The Evil Dead, Spider-Man, Drag Me to Hell). Basically, in an alternative universe, teenager America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez) from the Utopian Parallel and a version of Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) are being chased by a demon in the space between universes while searching for the Book of Vishanti. Strange is killed and Chavez accidentally creates a portal that transports herself and Strange's corpse to Earth-616 (the Avengers universe wiped out by Thanos). In this universe, its version of Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) rescues Chavez from a large one-eyed tentacled demon, a Gargantos, with help from Wong (Benedict Wong), the Sorcerer Supreme. Chavez explains that the beings are hunting her because she has the power to travel through the Multiverse. But Chavez does know how to control her power and has lived with the guilt of accidentally transporting her parents to another universe as a child, she hopes they are alive and will find them one day. Strange has been having a ""nightmare"" every night for some time, but Chavez takes Strange and Wong to the corpse of Defender Strange to prove that the ""nightmare"" is actually a glance of his counterparts across the Multiverse. Looking at Defender Strange's corpse, Strange discovers runes of witchcraft, like there were on the tentacled monster. So, he visits Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) at her farm to ask her about what she knows about the Multiverse. But slowly it is revealed that she is responsible for the attacks, she has become the Scarlet Witch after acquiring the Darkhold, aka the Book of Spells, or the Book of the Damned. Overcome with grief of losing Vision, she created a universe for herself called Westfield (as seen in WandaVision, going through decades of sitcoms), during which she created twin boys, Billy (Julian Hilliard) and Tommy (Jett Klyne). She wants to use Chavez's powers to travel the Multiverse and reunite with her children. When Strange refuses to surrender Chavez, Maximoff attacks Kamar-Taj, the main headquarters of the Masters of the Mystic Arts and kills many sorcerers. Chavez accidentally transports herself and Strange through numerous universes, until they reach Earth-838. Meanwhile, Maximoff uses the Darkhold to ""dream-walk"" and takes control of this universe's counterpart of sacrifices herself to destroy the Darkhold and break the dream-walk. Herself, to live a suburban life with her children. A surviving sorceress, Sara (Sheila Atim), sacrifices herself to destroy the Darkhold and break the dream-walk. Enraged, Maximoff forces Wong to take her to the forbidden ancient temple of Mount Wundagore to re-establish the dream-walk. While searching for help, Strange and Chavez are apprehended by Karl Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor), Earth-838's Sorcerer Supreme, and brought before the Illuminati, an organisation group of heroes with superpowers. The group, many alternate versions of those Strange knows, consists of Mordo, Peggy Carter aka Captain Carter (Hayley Atwell), Blackagar Boltagon aka Black Bolt (Anson Mount), Maria Rambeau aka Captain Marvel (Lashana Lynch), Reed Richards aka Mister Fantastic (John Krasinski) of the Fantastic Four, and Charles Xavier aka Professor X (Patrick Stewart) of the X-Men. They explain that using their universe's Darkhold recklessly to try to defeat Thanos, Earth-838's Strange triggered a universe-destroying ""incursion"". After Thanos was defeated, the Illuminati executed their Strange to stop him from causing more harm. Mordo believes that Earth-616's Strange is similarly dangerous, but Maximoff arrives in her Earth-838 counterpart's body after re-establishing her dream-walk at Mount Wundagore before the Illuminati can pass judgment. She kills all of the Illuminati except Mordo, who Strange subdues before fleeing with Chavez. The Earth-838 counterpart of Strange's ex-fiancé Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams), a scientist working with the Illuminati, helps them to escape. Strange, Chavez, and Palmer enter the space between universes to find the Book of Vishanti, which is the antithesis to the Darkhold. But Maximoff appears and destroys it, and then takes over Chavez's mind, using her powers to send the others to an incursion-destroyed universe. Strange meets the destroyed universe's Strange, following his corruption of the Darkhold, the two fight with this universe's Strange defeated. Strange uses the Darkhold to dream-walk into the corpse of deceased alternate Strange who was buried in Earth-616 and previously accompanied Chavez. With Wong's help, Strange saves Chavez from Maximoff as she tries to take Chavez's powers, and encourages Chavez to use her abilities. Chavez transports Maximoff to Earth-838, where Billy and Tommy are crying seeing their real mother suffering and recoiling in fear at her. Maximoff realises the error of her actions and uses her powers to destroy the temple, destroying all copies of the Darkhold throughout the multiverse and apparently killing herself in the process. Chavez returns Strange and Palmer to their respective universes. Sometime later, Kamar-Taj has been repaired, and the surviving sorcerers continue their training, with Chavez joining them. As a result of using the Darkhold and dream-walking into a corpse, Strange develops a third eye. During the credits, Strange meets a sorceress, Clea (Charlize Theron), who warns him that his actions have triggered an incursion that he must help fix, and he follows her into the Dark Dimension. Also starring Michael Stuhlbarg as Dr. Nic West, Bruce Campbell as Pizza Poppa, Adam Hugill as the voice of Rintrah, and Ross Marquand as the voice of Ultron. I should mention, it might have helped if I'd seen WandaVision before seeing this (I watched it after seeing the film, it's a good show), as its story was continued in the film, specifically where her sons came from (her children with Vision), but never mind. Cumberbatch gives a terrific performance as the mystical energy wielding hero, Olsen almost steals the show as the emotionally charged villain who longs to be reunited with a family that never truly existed, newcomer Gomez is well cast as the teenager with multiverse-hopping abilities, and supporting cast all do well also, including the guest star appearances. The story is a little overwhelmed at times by future plotline points, and obviously switching between the universes requires your close attention, but it is visually stunning, with spellbinding CGI special effects creating exciting fights and taking through the different worlds, and there moments of humour and horror added to the mix (obvious references to Evil Dead), a splendid superhero fantasy action adventure.

","The build up to this film's release was interesting. The trailers were great but once I heard that Sam Raimi was forced into 3+ months of reshoots, the runtime was only 2h and 6m and that the ending wasn't even written yet when filming started I was worried. Though it wasn't nearly as bad as some other comic-book films that have suffered from reshoots (i.e. Fan4stic, Suicide Squad, Justice League, etc) it was still obvious. Many plot points, characters and especially the first act felt very rushed. Which is most likely due to the original runtime being 2h and 43m. However my favorite aspect about the film was Sam Raimi's direction, even with the reshoots his style managed to come through well. In fact there are a lot horror elements which were very reminiscent of the Evil Dead Films. Benedict Cumberbatch remains great as the title character and Elizabeth Olsen is the best she's ever been as Scarlett Witch.

721,15 May 2022,Horst_In_Translation,6," All eyes on Strange
","""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" is an American English-language movie from 2022, so a really new release and the name of the title makes it very obvious of course already that this is the newest addition to the Marvel cinematic universe. Dr. Strange is back at the center of the story in these over two hours we have here. This means that Benedict Cumberbatch is also back and he has really had an amazing year. I am still a bit hesitant when it comes to him though. I am struggling a bit with really seeing him as a tough superhero, but it has been even more of a challenge for me in the past I guess if I remember correctly. Same applies to slightly comedic moments in these films and all Marvel films have those pretty much. His comedic line delivery surely deserves some fine tuning. But let's stay with the basics first. The director here is Sam Raimi, who is over 60 now and of course still famous for the Evil Dead films and for the Spider-Man trilogy starring Tobey Maguire. You can identify his style really easily with this film here towards the end. I am of course talking about the segment in which the title character basically revives his deceased self. But also when all these other lost spirits come to haunt the main antagonist it feels very Raimi. As all these superheroes get mixed nowadays, it was no huge surprise to see him here. The screenplay is not by Raimi, but by Michael Waldron, an Emmy winner in the animation category and he also worked on the television series Loki. So no surprise he took the next step here and wrote a Marvel full feature film, even if it is maybe a bit surprising that he is the only writer really. Big responsibility. It all worked out kinda well though. As for the cast, you will get more than just a few familiar faces from other Marvel movies, most of all these especially attached to Dr. Strange. This means Rachel McAdams' character is back. Benedict Wong's character is back. Even Chiowetel Ejiofor's character is back, hey it's the multiverse. Michael Stuhlbarg also reprises his role very early on and I thought he was really wasted, probably because I like the actor this much. Shame he had almost no screen time in here. Elizabeth Olsen returns as well and she even plays the main antagonist. I will elaborate on her right away.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

","Doctor strange in the multiverse of madness is a very thrilling movie that will have you at the edge of your seats.

Elizabeth as the scarlet witch totally stole the show with her crazy good performances and gave us her best work yet to the point where she as a villain outshined doctor strange. Strange went on a very exciting journey on this film and it was so much fun following him throughout the multiverse. I can't say too much about him without spoiling something so i will just say that if you missed stephen already you will be glad to have him back. This movie gave us a great introduction to the multiverse and got me extremely hyped for more. In terms of cameos, maybe lower your expectations a bit. Let's just say that i now understand what kevin feige meant when he said they they showed too much in the trailers! Unfortunately i also have to say that the movie felt very fast paced which is just so unnecessary. There was no reason for this movie to be the shortest phase 4 film so far. There was just one proper storyline, which was very will written and gripping to watch, but no other actual plots. I wish they would have given us sam raimi's original last cut instead. He did a phenomenal job! You could really tell that this was his movie, it is a raimi classic! The horror elements in the second half of the movie were exactly what i wanted them to be and more.

","Soo my wife who's a big marvel fan, but not a big horror fan was pretty surprised by the vibe of this one. It had a lot of the campy horror vibes from the original evil dead, and other Raimi movies. It just didn't vibe well. A lot of the psychedelic beauty and humor of the first movie wasn't there. The characters choices didn't make a whole lot of sense and there wasn't as much humorous dialog. The few jump scares in the movie were great, but at the last action sequence it just kinda fell flat with the action being fairly brutal, but not fast paced enough. There's a couple detours that were unnecessary made by both the villain and doctor strange. It was watchable, but probably not a movie I would ever rewatch and for a marvel movie that's saying something.

Nothing or no one has any depth. Even shifting it in to a Scarlet Witch centric movie felt one dimensional and completely unsatisfying. The saving grace is the visuals and ""trippy"" fight scenes. Despite some truly awful special effects at times (when a film is 75 CGI, I guess some scenes can't merit enough budget) the visuals carry the load. Besides being heartless, the contrivances and flat out dumb plot turns also hurt a great deal. The one new character introduced (America Chavez) typifies everything wrong with this misfire. She is a plot device that registers as nothing but a shallow and ridiculous shadow of an actual character.

I have being a comic book geek for 3 decades and have mostly enjoyed all the MCU offerings. What Raimi has done here is put his spin and sense of humor into this latest Dr. Strange outing. I thoroughly enjoyed the darker tones and horror/light gore addition. If anyone has truly read and followed Dr. Strange for years you will appreciate these darker tones and some of the familiar creatures included in the movie. Now spoilers: Wanda is not always good in the comics and again if anyone has followed the character they have seen her kill and outright murder the good and the bad when she has a huge emotional breakdown or stressor. So if all you know about these characters is what you have seen in the latest tv shows and past movies you know very very little about these characters. Wanda going dark and losing control due to the evil book and loss of her children is one of those emotional stressors that could cause her to lose control. The SFX were awesome. Wanda killing the Illuminati heroes was heart wrenching and showed the decay and angst she was going through. Zombie Dr. Strange was a ton of fun and made total sense as he did not want to use a living person and put them in danger. He risked his soul to not risk another person and their soul.

",I would be lying if I said I was a huge MCU fan but I have seen all of the movies except a few which I have tried to watch and found unbearable. That said a few stick out to me and this one really does it. Prior to this I would have said my favorite was either Black Panther or the first Doctor Strange but for me the character growth and visuals of this movie something unique. This stands out to me as arguably the best and most unique filmmaking of the MCU. This movie feels like a true comic book movie and it feels like a Sam Raimi movie. To a point a would compare this to last year's suicide squad film where it just felt like and over the top comic film. Furthermore this felt like a riskier movie due to the more graphic scenes but also a more emotionally weighted. It has a villain who has a clear motive but is so obsessed with it that she is beyond reason and a hero who is empty on the inside. Throughout the film we see Strange realize that he cannot win by doing everything himself and that he has to rely on others. We see the question asked if he is happy and this is a great take on him has a hero something Disney has repeatedly neglected in their superhero movies while Logan and The Watchmen have already done this incredibly well.,/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

","I had high expectations for this Doctor Strange sequel. Unfortunately, In the Multiverse of Madness failed to meet any of my expectations. It's big, colorful, and absolutely stupid. There's nothing in the movie that feels original. It takes concepts that were introduced in WandaVision, Loki, and Spider-Man No Way Home and does nothing to build upon them. The plot also relies too heavily on shock factor cameos that add nothing to the story. Cameos are fine, but they need to contribute to the plot in a meaningful way. Which they did not in this film. Sam Raimi, the director, who is most famous for directing the original Spider-Man trilogy, shows that he hasn't grown at all as a director since Spider-Man 3. This is essentially a Tobey Maguire Spider-Man movie starring Doctor Strange. It feels so off. The score is bad, the dialogue is at times cringe worthy, and surprisingly the CGI was very underwhelming. The story was rushed and at times felt outright dumb. Luckily, it's not all bad. As always, Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda is amazing. She really carries the film. Her performance makes it worth the trip to the theater. Cumberbatch and Rachael McAdams are both good too. The action, while visually lacking at times (messy CGI), was still entertaining. I think my biggest problem with this film is that it bites off more than it can chew. It tries to be too many things. It has a lot of interesting ideas, but it's all too rushed and poorly put together. Raimi tried to add in horror elements, but it ended up being more laughable than scary, and not in the good way. It's just a mess, but an entertaining mess at that. It's not bad, but for the MCU it's definitely underwhelming. Ultimately I don't think Sam Raimi was up for the task.

","After a rough two years following the pandemic in which the MCU had almost only misses, Dr. Strange 2 is one of the few exceptions. It's not one of the strongest, but its entertainment value is there. This is true mostly thanks to Sam Raimi who gave an excellent performance behind the camera and of the creative team. The visuals, the various worlds, the imaginary and the camera movements are all inspired and the final segment is a total madness such that I think some scenes will become iconic. On the other side however, the plot is very weak. At least there is an overall sense and so the great visuals are not wasted, but if we look closer a lot of problem come to the surface. Also the whole premise of the movie, the villan and its motivations are kind of a nonsense because they could have been solved right at the start of the movie. And so if I have to do an average I'd say that Dr. Strange 2 is an ok movie, that is able to entertain for all of its duration and that is a fresh new entry for the MCU with a particular style, but the issues of the plot prevent it to go from a fun watch to an incredible experience.

","Probably the most underrated MCU film in my opinion and one of the more underrated Sam Raimi films. This film is an absolute blast to watch. I was very skeptical beforehand about this being a cameo fest film and while there were some cameos, it was relegated to one section of the film and there weren't a lot of them. Plus they use those cameo characters in an interesting way. This isn't perfect by any means and the script is easily the weakest part of the film. The dialogue is definitely VERY rough around the edges and it definitely could have used another rewrite or two but oh my god the directing, performances, and characters are great. I really enjoyed seeing Doctor Strange's and Wanda's arcs in this film. Both coming to terms with what they have lost. I really loved that Wanda was the villain of the film. I really wanted WandaVision to go in that direction but it didn't and it seems that this film rectified that decision and saying what Wanda did in her show wasn't okay. It's safe to say here that all of the performances are great. Benedict Cumberbatch is still doing a great job as Strange and Elizabeth Olsen shines as Wanda but Xochitl Gomez shines as America Chavez. I hope we see more of her in the future. My absolute favorite aspect of this film is Sam Raimi's direction. It truly feels that Kevin Feige just told Sam Raimi to do whatever he wanted as long as he followed the script and my god did he deliver. Besides the first hour, this film is screaming that this is his film. The camera movements, the horror elements, and especially the gore. There was a surprising amount of violence in this film that I didn't expect to see from the MCU and it was definitely a welcome decision. I do believe though that this film would be so much better if the dialogue was ironed out more but this is so much fun that I can't hate on it too much. The second post credit scene is also one of my favorites in the MCU however it really only works if you've seen Raimi's other films. Definitely go check this out if you're an MCU fan and especially if you are a Raimi fan. You won't be disappointed.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

",Noticed this has some bad reviews on here but seriously.... I got what I expected from this sequel. The plot made so much sense and will continue to make sense in upcoming phases of the marvel universe. Performances from Elizabeth Olsen were exceptional...far more than her Avengers Cameo. Also the CGIs and the ATMOS will make you appreciate every fight scene; very impactful and beautiful. This movie made so much sense to me and I think it will play a very vital role in subsequent movies.... they just used this to create an open end to begin and build other new franchises.,/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

","It's...ok? I mean... It's a very entertaining movie. The exacution ain't too bad. The story's structure's smooth at some point, and as I think, if you can accept the ridiculousness of the multiverse, then you are quite well to enjoy it. Unfortunately, the movie's topic is kind of out of nowhere. Like they are running out of ideas already. Those previous movies which are before phase 4 have a very main storyline along with all of them. The avengers, Thanos, even the Endgame was kind of foreshadowed... But this Wanda idea and nothing really seem to happened in the end? I am not sure. If it goes as a sequel of the no way home, it will seem more related and it will have a more bigger and more convincing reason of how this ""multiverse"" idea can be our next topic of the MCU. Indeed, the story concludes with an incursion coming in the end, but for me, it can have more story based explanation or better exacution. And the fight with the sinister strange...I don't even know what's that fight for or what's even the meaning of sinister strange showing up as they have put much attention to him in the trailer 🙂 However, I think one thing good about this movies is the changing of Wanda. She is desperated to have her kids back. It's totally understandable. There's also the whole explanation in WandaVision so her changing doesn't seem odd and sudden.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

How often can you see an actor pose dramatically while they unleash their CGI powers upon a villain and send them flying back forty feet? Luckily the Marvel brand humor and snappy dialogue is still here along with two great stinger scenes during and after the end credits.

","I was really excited for the concept of a Marvel Movie directed by Sam Raimi, I'm still waiting for that to happen eventually because this movie is not it. Raimi's creative vision is bogged down by Marvel's generic, formulaic, and derivative cinematography, resulting in a jarring clash of visuals that borderlines on mediocrity. The dreaded reshoots are very obvious as well, with scenes being interrupted by boring nothingness that add literally zero value to the plot but serves to push merchandise and get brownie points for including ""diversity"" that will undoubtedly get removed for the Chinese release of this film. The story and it's conflict rely on making established characters complete parodies of themselves, magic is used as a crutch to explain every moronic decision by the writing department, and the more Marvel studios tries to explain their own rules the more plot holes they make by having people who either haven't seen the previous material or simply don't care to adhere to their own established cannon.

","Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was a movie I was fairly excited gor. The trailer looked pretty hood, and it being helmed by Sam Raimi was an obvious pull, but I was unfortunately disappointed. The premise is flawed right from the beginning. The story mostly focusses around Wanda or Scarlett Witch after the events of Wandavision, immediately meaning if you haven't seen the show, your investment in the movie is severely lower than people who have seen it. The character of America Chavez is more of a plot device than a character. Right from the first scene with Wanda we can see just how little interest the writers have in exploring the complex morality of Wanda's actions when Steven tells her it was absolutely fine for her to enslave a village full of people because she fixed it in the end. Wanda does a lot of insanely over the top things in the beginning of the film that just feel out of character, like they are trying to hard to force her into a villain role, but this is explained with the boring old fantasy trope that she was 'corrupted' by *insert dark magic object*. This does lead to some really cool Sam Raimi horror scenes that make the movie fun to watch, but ultimately lacking in substance. Steven is sidelined in his own movie, and although they try to give him some character, they seem very confused as to where they want to take his character, which leads to a character arc that feels very vague and confused. The magical powers of the characters are explored in some very fun ways throughout the film, but the actual multiverse mentioned in the title is hardly explored, despite the massive potential with such a cool concept. There is one very brief sequence that shows a few cool universes, but it is very disappointing and far too short. Wanda's character arc is very weak and uncompelling since the writers show no interest in delving into the possible complexity of her character, so she ends up coming off as 2 dimensional. If you are looking for a movie with cool visuals and that iconic Sam Raimi style I'm sure you will enjoy this movie, but if you want a good story I advise you look elsewhere.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

This film is probably just a symptom of Disney/Marvel realizing that people will go see these things regardless of the quality and they can rake in the cash. That overarching complaint applies to so many other just-churn-them-out superhero films, but the first Dr. Strange film was a nice break from that disappointment-train of movies... it was actually kind of enjoyable, with a storyline that didn't make me want to smash my head against something blunt and dense. I guess they could only delay the inevitable so long and had a huge debt to the corporate-garbage-gods, and boy oh boy did it show in this film. Is it just me, but do the power levels between heros in this film mean nothing to the writers?

","I cannot understand some of these higher ratings. Maybe there are more Sam Raimi fans than I thought, but with the momentum and financial clout Marvel Studios currently has, this shouldn't be seen as anything other than a misfire. The CGI was underwhelming and was in danger of falling into the same trap as the Snyder dross. Action sequences were meh, but it's hard to tell if they were that bad or the constant bombardment of overly dramatic music (worst and most dated and cliched soundtrack to any marvel film to date) just dulled the senses. It just wasn't much of anything - not fun, not scary, not gripping, not clever and was a huge waste of the two main leads talent. 5 out of 10 was as kind as I could be but novelty and nods to fans will never replace good story telling.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022
1030,9 May 2022,SamuSixx,8," A spectacular film with horror overtones as Raimi knows how to do.
","First of all this movie has something that is not really expected especially in Marvel products and I'm referring to the plot, finally we have a product with a logical thread that runs straight from beginning to end except for a few small things that we will analyze later. At the direction we have the great Sam Raimi and it's very noticeable, some scenes are pure horror Raimi style as the shots. The fight scenes are beautifully shot especially one scene in particular that includes the use of musical notes on a staff. The music is wonderful, not surprisingly they are of the great Danny Elfman who also in this film has done an excellent job. Unfortunately, I must say that the multiverse issue in my opinion has not been deepened enough despite being the main theme of the film, still leaves too many questions. I liked the various cameos that were not too excessive in the film because they are not random cameos for no reason (like in Spider-Man: No Way Home), but rather have their own reason to be there. I liked all the different variations of Strange and Wanda is a creepy character (as she rightly should be) almost leaning towards horror. One thing I thought was ""ridiculous"" was the death of America Chavez's parents, in my opinion they could have come up with something more believable at least. The CGI is perfect except for a few moments but you can get over it easily. The film is full of references and little surprises that only the most attentive people were able to spot. There is one last thing that bothered me, at the end of the movie we see America Chavez trying to open a portal and rightly so, given his little experience, he can not open it but I would like to remember Ned in Spider-Man: No Way Home that without any experience and totally at random can open at least three portals. However, all in all, it's a beautiful movie with its flaws but definitely a Marvel product that aims high with a beautiful story and ""violent"" scenes not typical of the MCU.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

","The hype after No Way Home was real... the fact that Doctor Strange has been one of the most powerful and prominent characters in the MCU since 2016 also made the hype go crazy. Sam Raimi coming in to direct, Elizabeth Olsen being casted, Patrick Stewart, and more were all reasons why this movie had the potential to be great. I was skeptical for this just like I was for No Way Home. The only problem is that No Way Home stuck the landing and this one... just didnt. I got in my car after the movie was over and just sat there for about 15 minutes trying to get my thoughts together. I'm conflicted. I love Scarlet Witch and Doctor Strange. They're some of my favorite characters in the MCU... but in this one they just felt like some part of their arcs were missing. Wandavision was great up until the final episode for me and this is a continuation of WV but it doesn't have the same charm or charisma. I've wanted Wanda to go evil but it just felt weird and they could've done it way better. The movie is rushed, they don't let Sam Raimi go full Raimi, the cameos feel a bit cheapened, and the whole movie just feels... off. Now I didn't hate it or anything and I did enjoy most of it for what it was... but it could've been so much more. There's so many character choices that just piss me off.. I have so many complaints and questions and I don't know, man... it just feels rushed, incomplete, and like they switched directors and the chronological order of movies (which they did). All in all, on first watch Doctor Strange 2 gets a 7/10 from me. The first one was way better and this one is probably dead in the middle of the MCU for me.

1074,22 June 2022,twilightshadows-428-400303,9," I don't get the criticism
","Sam Raimi has been quoted as saying they cut 40 minutes because they were concerned it was too long. Depending on what was cut, they could maybe have left it in. The movie is very fast paced and didn't feel anywhere near 2 hours. I'd have liked more of the multiverse, and some of the scenes could have been expanded. That's probably my biggest criticism. Overall, it's still an excellent film. The only significant character addition is Gomez as America Chavez, and she's superb, particularly for a young actress who doesn't have much film experience. She's incredibly likable and makes you care about her character. The other major actors are familiar faces and do their usual amazing job. The visuals and effects are incredible, even better than the first Doctor Strange, and possibly some of the best in the MCU. Not only are they very well done, but there are also some that are unique, particularly within the MCU. I was especially impressed with the rendition of Gargantus, much more realistic looking than the B movie quality of the starfish monster in Suicide Squad. The creators at VFX have stated they began working on it nearly a year and a half before the movie's release, and it shows. Additionally there's a scene of Wanda crawling out of a shield that is uber creepy and a scene of 2 versions of Doctor Strange battling with music notes that is truly inspired. There are many many others, but I don't want to give too much away. Then there's the actual story, which is, even in a blockbuster, an important part. I've seen people complaining the movie is more about Wanda than Doctor Strange (it's not) and that it didn't continue from the first Doctor Strange. Did these people know nothing about the movie before seeing it? They've been saying for months that it was changed because of COVID delays, releasing Spider Man before, when it was originally scheduled after, and the series released on Disney+. They've also said it would pick up from where Wanda Vision left off. Additionally, a lot has happened within the MCU since the first Doctor Strange, so it makes sense his story would have to be adjusted. I'll admit the story was different from what I was expecting (I don't want to say how as that would spoil it), but it was still a good story. My biggest disappointment was it didn't involve Loki. But it has many of the elements of a good comic book story. For starters, it's a very human story. Part of it is heartfelt, and part of it is tragic. There's also character growth for all of the main characters. There's redemption and sacrifice. There's even a memorable quote by our favorite wise man in the wheel chair that may well become iconic. There are complex themes, and it leaves us with larger questions to discuss. However, some of it is subtle, it's not in your face or spoon fed like so much of what's coming out of Hollywood these days. I personally appreciate that. It is not a movie about a cursed book, and the inclusion of that book in the movie has nothing to do with Sam Raimi directing. The Darkhold is simply a plot device, one lifted directly from the comics and which was introduced to the MCU in Wanda Vision. It is violent, as are most comic book movies. Oddly I've seen criticisms it was too violent for the MCU or not violent enough for Sam Raimi. Though it's the first in the MCU to be classified as horror, I honestly don't see how it garnered that classification. I didn't notice that much of an increase in violence between this movie and Avengers Infinity Wars/Endgames. It's not scary, and there's certainly no blood or gore. There is an animated corpse and a few of what Strange refers to as the souls of the damned, so maybe that was it. As for Sam Raimi, yes he's famous for the Evil Dead films, but he also directed the Toby McGuire Spiderman trilogy and The Great and Powerful Oz. Despite the corpse scene, which incidentally wasn't his idea, this is much closer to his Spiderman than Evil Dead. Why anyone would except anything else I can't imagine. He was hesitant to do the corpse scene, but I'm glad he did. It's both an incredible visual scene and an ingenious solution to a problem Strange faces. Like the fight with music notes, it's unique, out of the box thinking, something we haven't seen a thousand times before. Overall I think this film is very well done and well worth seeing. As for the criticism, I've come to the conclusion recently that there are just a lot of people who like being negative and probably never post a positive review.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

There is a slightly rejuvenating quality to it that has got more to do with the directorial craftsmanship on display than the scripted premise and when it taps into the madness, it is at least somewhat fun.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

","I quite enjoy Dr Strange, both in the comics and in the first movie. I liked the concept of the multiverse and how it was used in the movie. However, the basic plot was lacking as it was hard to believe Scarlet Witch's motivation. Worse was the blatant 'rah, rah, America'! The main focus character is named America, who has a unique power and does not have duplicates throughout the multiverse, the way every other character does. Just a little too blatant nationalism, as this is not a common name - should have just called her 'Carol' or something.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

","If you like movies with dull plots and acting, this film is perfect for you. The story just felt bland and seemed like a big waste of time. Throughout the film we're told the multiverse is a wild place with unlimited possibilities and outcomes but we hardly see that instead we just get given a few boring areas in the film that are blatantly just green screened and lack any realness or emotion. The story itself is so boring and the main antagonists reasons for being the antagonist are genuinely laughable, it's that stupid. I'm not a big fan of the MCU admittedly but 'Dr Strange (2016)' was one of the few I enjoyed the most and it's a shame the sequel failed to live up to it whatsoever. The main reason I was exited for 'Dr Strange and the Multiverse of Madness' was cameos from characters that haven't been introduced yet or have been introduced in previous franchises however these cameos feel so pointless and for the sake of getting peoples attention which 'Marvel Studios' clearly saw as a cash grab after the success of 'Spider-Man: No way home'. It's funny to be saying that the cameos were what I was looking forward to the most yet now I've seen the movie I'm genuinely disappointed with them. Especially considering how long they last in the film. Would I watch this film again? Probably not.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

But the movie has serious continuity issues in terms of its character writing and the characters powers and abilities. The character motivations and aren't explained with any depth or clarity. And dr strange despite it being his movie does next to nothing of value throughout most of it. It's not a terrible movie but it does next to nothing for the characters or the overrall mcu. We don't need new characters introduced every movie or some crazy multiverse plots to be interested. At its core It's the rich characters that draw us to these movies but seems like everyone has forgotten that.

","In the past, Marvel was able to create unique films that occasionally stunned, but sometime in the last few years they've lost their touch. It was an interesting decision to bring back Raimi, and it might've been different if they had given him final cut, but I'm just surmising that Disney might've tampered with his vision. There were bright spots, specifically the creative visuals, and the third act that improved upon the previous two. But the flaws overshadowed the majority of the film. I have a slight issue with the Multiverse infatuation that Hollywood seems to be experiencing right now. As it pertains to this film, the concept of there being infinite universes lowers the stakes of the story, and possibly even negatively impacts the significance of previous films in the MCU. Additionally, Elizabeth Olsen's performance was shaky, the tone appeared to be unintentionally silly, and America Chavez was more of a plot tool to give them access to the multiverse rather than a genuine character. Trying to be bigger and more complex is not always the best route to a great film, especially in this case.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

A film like that should've held a runtime of at least 2h 30m.

By the time I got to the third act, my head was hurting as it couldn't receive additional information due to the crammed and rushed events the story had for 2 acts.

","Visually, its amazing. One of the stronger ones from Marvel. Visually, its a lot closer to Raimi's horror too. Offbeat styling with a hint of silly comedy . The fight scenes is noticeably better that usual. The way they handled multiverses is admirable compared to Spider Man, in that they made their own world and its well presented for its viewers. Other than that, its a disaster. The plot is just questionable. Given that Dr Strange actually was given a better and succinct description of what has the power of Multiverse entails, in hindsight, makes the main catalyst of Wanda look plainly stupid. My sister and I was literally making adoption/mother jokes towards the end of the film. ""I'm a mother"" and ""Its for my boys"" are now trigger words for me. And then that other multiverse was not even given an inch of thought whatsoever. Just literally made for cameos and brief intros. I was chuckling how things falls apart in that universe like in a second. Lol. The acting was not really worth noting, though Xochitl Gomez sticks like a sore thumb. She kinda lacks the vibe of film acting. IDK, its like she is just reading her lines at times. By the end, I was just a camp experience but at least it was not kissing my ass, unlike certain film released last year.

","I'm a big Sam Raimi fan and whenever there's a movie randomly playing on TV I can tell that it's a Sam Raimi film. I've seen his Evil Dead Trilogy and Spider-Man Trilogy, let's face it most of us watch this because he's directing and we enjoy his filmography and style, he's the reason why us 2000s kids love Spider-Man so much, and why we come to love Marvel films. When it was announced that Sam Raimi the father of the Maguire Spider-Man trilogy will be directing I was completely surprised since Marvel has lately only been bringing in indie filmmakers who have never directed a blockbuster before which's why most of their films are a bit of VFX eyesore. But I had faith in Sam he has a background in blockbusters, he worked & mastered VFX, character-based action, and great character development. I was also hoping that the studio won't get in the way of his vision like what Sony did to Spider-Man 3 and knowing the MCU's more on their vision than the directors I was worried and while watching it I realized...",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

But the movie is based on the hypothetical situations or to simply put it's based on till the limit of human imagination. The infinite is not a number, it's a variable the term infinite is nothing more than undefined. But the multiverse and the way it was shown in the movie defines the term infinite for our imagination. The incursion for intruding any other universe is a concept definitely intriguing. The acting of Benedict was perfect. He played all the roles perfectly. Elizabeth did the job just about perfect as well. The plot twist had me on edge every time and dude the horrific animation and scenes were really scary I can confirm that as I have seen many animes with horrible scenes. I think it was a little bit fast paced but I think that add a little more spice to the madness thing. The small references and the nostalgia were amazing. The death and the way they die showed the fact that the movie is really dark. The amazing scenes and editing in them were amazing ofc.

","If you're a fan of Sam Raimi you'll love this movie. It is Strange in some of the best ways possible. I don't consider it anything like ""best motion picture of the year""(despite a high rating). It is great for what it is and if you're looking for something that doesn't hit you over the head with an over-the-top political message this will be a good experience. It's by no means perfect but there's a lot to take from it. Especially the direction of Sam Raimi, it's one of the best looking Marvel Films to date. You can tell Raimi's personality is all over the film. Like I said it is strange in some of the best ways possible, but flawed if Strange isn't for you. Being open to the film is on you. Finally, the writing is just as weird as you'd expect a Raimi film to be. The one liners are just a fun addition, they're not like the brilliant cheese of George Lucas. The major flaw could be America Chavez who feels a bit like a plot device rather than an actual character.(this common but not oppressive). I'm not a ""marvel fanatic"" I appreciate what this is and what it is a generally enjoyable experience. I haven't watched every marvel show, nor do I care to watch all of them.

","Another disappointing phase 4 entry to the MCU. The only people I can see liking this are die hard comic book fans or MCU stans who claim every movie is good. MOM was very unfulfilling to it's title as we explored just 2 different universes and saying we ""explored"" them is a generous statement. You would think that since the film only travels to 2 universes that it would spend a portion of its runtime showcasing the differences between universes and how things operate and function but we get little to none of that. This was the MCU's chance to get weird with it and let Sam Raimi's goofiness shine. This movie consists of lots of corny Sam Raimi stuff that doesn't work. This movie attempts to be a horror... but only when it feels like it and it really throws off the tone of the movie. The transitions from scene to scene are also whacky and don't fit the tone. There is a full slow-mo fight with musical notes that is so hard to watch because it's just nothing but slow-mo hits and weird slow music. Elizabeth Olsen's performance as the Scarlet Witch is downright terrible and her character arc is equally bad. The whole ""oh no what have I done"" cliche was so predictable and boring to see. Not to mention the character's death is super lazy. Like why couldn't she she just fly outside of the temple THEN crush it. Why did she have to stand in the middle of the temple to destroy it?! There was no reason other then the fact that the writers wanted to kill her off. Benedict Cumbernatch and Benedict Wong have pretty solid performances and character arcs in this movie. I wish I could say the same about America Chavez. She is given almost no characterization whatsoever and is used as a plot device for the movie until Strange tells her to ""believe"" and she just is able to control her powers... just like that. What is this?! The Lego Movie?! How can you give a character no characterization then tell her to believe and then she nearly singlehandedly beats one of the most powerful characters in the MCU?! What a joke. Another joke in this movie is the Illuminati. All the trailers hyped them up to be a big part of this movie but no they introduce them 1 scene and the VERY NEXT kill them off. Why would you hype them up and make it seem like there going to have a stake in the plot just to do them dirty like that. The last thing I'm going to talk about is the ending. The ending doesn't even make sense. Strange is walking down the street when all of a sudden he has a huge mental breakdown and then the movie cuts to the credits... and then in the post credit scene he is up and walking again on the SAME STREET when some random chick opens up a portal, says ""come with me"" and Strange is like ""ok let's go"" Like what?! Who is she, what connection do you have with her?! It was never established and is just downright confusing.

The movie has some amazing ideas and visuals but the dialogue is even cheesier than in Spider-Man 3. The idea that Wanda is the villain is kinda cool but I am not sure that it fits her character very much (I could be wrong I haven't watched Wandavision). Also the way she wants to get what she wants is very stupid. She could just ask the girl to send her to her boys. Doctor Strange's magic was used super creatively especially the music fight scene. But even though the movie was interesting because of the fighting scenes it didn't leave a message inside me (maybe I am dumb and only I didn't get it). I think the idea of Doctor Strange not being happy is also cool but poorly executed. You definitely can see the ""Evil Dead"" influence that Raimi had, especially in the camera movement.

","Doctor Strange and the multiverse of madness is yet another disappointing entry in the Marvel Phase 4. I dont even know if you can call this a doctor Strange movie, since he feels more like a sidecharacter in his own story. This also becomes apparent once you realize that our beloved and cunning doctor isn't able to win a single fight in the whole movie. Even in the final battle he needs to get help from ""miss america"" (or whatever her name was I couldnt be bothered to memorize it). Marvel also tries to do a ""no way home""-effect by showing us cameos that should make the audience go crazy. However, that doesn't work when you have no idea how to write your characters. ""The smartest man alive"" is so stupid that he underestimates the threat of the main villain and gets killed in literally 2 seconds. That is good writing I guess? But lets talk about the worst part of the whole movie, miss america. God i hate everything about her. Her name, her weakly motivated political agenda, the lack of her background story (which was like not existing in the movie) and especially her acting.

It's okay if you believe that the dark hold was what over came her and she wasn't thinking for herself but it just kinda jumps right into her being the villain with little to no context.,/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

1336,12 May 2022,D4V1D2411,7," A good but a little dissapointing experience
","There are really great things about this movie but also some problematic things. To begin with, the beginning of the movie is kinda bad, it feels really rushed cause we have 2 fights in the first 10 minutes and just after those, Wanda is presented as a villain and a great battle at Kamar-Taj occurs just like at the first 20 minutes. I was really hoping that they slowed things down and when they do slow things and enter into the multiverse, things are much more clear and easy to follow. It dropps a little bit down at the end because I dont really felt the ending to be that exciting but it was still good and enjoyable. The characters of Wanda and Doctor Strange really shine when they are on screen, Wandas character feels a little bit disstant from where we left her on Wandavision but if you just go with it and assume the book has truly poisoned her, it works pretty well. But I didnt like the character of America Chavez, she feels more of an object all the character want because of her powers, and given that she does practically nothing before the end, I think she was really fogettable; the other side characters dont get a lot of attention but they work just fine. And Ive found out a lot of people have the problem that there werent enough cameos with all the expectation that this movie got, but for me, who hadnt really been expecting for half the universe to appear as cameos, it was fine, the additions of Professor X, Black Volt and Mr Fantastic where really cool and exciting to see so I dont have a problem with that. The style of the movie is also really good, feeling like a horror movie at some points, for example, when Wanda kills all the Illuminati in very brutal ways was super fun and is probably the best scene in the movie, I would like to see this tone in more future marvel movies since it worked so well.

","The more I see Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Strange, the more I dislike his casting. His doesn't bring anything interesting to the role besides his fame, which of course brings in his fans, which seems like the only reason he was cast. But there's no character there besides occasional sarcasm and a wig that looks like it belongs on a Lego. Seriously, Marvel makes billions off these movies and they can't give the lead character a decent-looking hairpiece? It may seem like a minor point, but it was distracting with Captain America and Black Widow. Here, the hairpiece is so jarringly present it deserves its own screen credit. Overall, this movie is just bland and noisy. It uses the messy WANDAVISION as a prequel; by the end of that show, Wanda seems to have resolved her issues with a tearful goodbye to her kids -- until the post-credit scene where we see her reading the evil McGuffin. Then, hocus pocus, suddenly she's full evil here, wants the kids back, and there is barely a hint of any of the good person she was before. Then this movie rips off the plot -- villain wants to steal alternates of his currently dead family from other universe -- as well as some of the look of INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE, but is nowhere near as inventive, engaging, or entertaining. Director Raimi brings some visual flare, but too little of it works because of all the glaring plot holes. Why doesn't she care about finding a new Vision? Where is White Vision? Where are the rest of her good friends, the Avengers? As for the Doc, it never seemed like Christine was his one true love in the first movie, and they both seemed to have moved on. (Or that movie didn't put the work in of establishing any depth to the relationship.) But then the WHAT IF-- series made it seem like Christine was THE ONE, and this movie picks up on that -- and just repeats what the cartoon did. Poor Rachel McAdams and her mole. The less said about the Illuminati stunt casting the better. Cheap, very cheap. Wong comes off like an idiot and America Chavez checks off a box. Superhero movies can be good, but this is just a mess.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

","Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness feels like a fantasy literature movie blended with qualities of a horror film so beware of taking young children to watch in theaters! The film is reminiscent of Harry Potter but on steroids. Overall, it is very fast paced and feels a little rushed, but it's held together well enough in specific sequences that gives audiences time to discern and much needed punctuation. The movie is peppered with themes much darker than the usual MCU flick and the director does a well enough job to piece together and answer unanswered questions from previous films and from the WandaVision sitcom.

1449,17 May 2022,KonkretFriedbert,8," Solid time in the theatre all things considered
","The idea of the multiverse is a really great one with it having essentially endless possibilities and worlds to explore. Which means the people behind the movie can be as creative as they would like to be. But it also opens up a number of traps to fall into that could lead to you messing up the continuity of your universe or things like that. Thankfully, there are no such things to be seen here, at least as far as I can tell. I perhaps should also mention that I haven't seen WandaVision yet, just like What If...? So I can't say whether there were any references to those series or things I couldn't have understood. Anyway, I definitely enjoyed the ""fan service"" if you can call it that which we received from all of these other Marvel franchises colliding with one another. Some casting decisions may have caught me off-guard like John Krasinski's Reed Richards, but I didn't hate anyone in here. America Chavez is a decent new character to get from this film to be honest and I think the chemistry with Cumberbatch is there for sure. Her arc isn't the best though, as her issue towards the beginning is as generic as the way she resolves it in the end. I could have lived without another ""believe in yourself, you can do it and you could do it all along"" moment is all I'm saying, you know. I was surprised that she wasn't thought to be the most dangerous individual when it comes to the multiverse but Doctor Strange instead, but it is what it is. Strange himself (our Strange) is pretty much like he always has been and I appreciate that consistency very much. He definitely has a better showing here than he does in the previous MCU entry, but I digress. Wong is just Wong and with him out of the way we arrive at Wanda Maximoff, easily my most conflicted character of the bunch. To say she hasn't had an easy life up to this point would be an understatement, that's for sure. However, I can't help but feel like I have seen this before, her reasoning for everything she's doing and all that jazz. I know she is being manipulated by the Darkhold, but still. Once you accept her questionable decision making and methods to achieve her goals, it's a pretty solid chunk of the film that you can enjoy. Towards the end though, things get bad again. I wasn't sure how they were going to end it all and have her be defeated, but this would have been one of the least likely possibilities if you would have asked me beforehand. It's just so...underwhelming, you know ?

","When Avengers:Endgame pushed a narrative 'reset' button, it created a problem for the future of the MCU. How can we trust and believe that any events matter if a future film can simply find a magic device to undo them? Tension is dissipated, emotional impact dulled. Mix that with the MCU's approach to the multiverse and this film is seriously hobbled before it starts; nothing really matters. And whilst it looks spectacular - and there are some impressive moments of genuine visual invention - it lacks physical weight; none of this hits the viewer between the eyes the way, say, Inception's startling and very physical visuals do. The second half is better than the first, not least because that's where Raimi seems more free to be Raimi - horror-tinged, and at times downright weird. Unfortunately a decent cast is undermined by Cumberbatch seeming so detached he may as well be sending in his performance via a voice only Zoom meeting. Thankfully it's not as bloated a running time as other recent entities; and whilst there is stuff to enjoy here, the overriding feeling is that either the MCU needs to be radically refreshed or else it's outstaying its welcome.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

","Let me start off by saying the first half of the film is actually pretty decent. You have an interesting plot and villain and it kicks off with high action too which was great. But then from about halfway in it really gets messy. First of all, those 'surprise' cameos aren't as 'surprising' as you might think, apart from one, who was a nice addition to the cast, however, his role was hardly worth the actors effort, as he was killed within 10 minutes of being seen. So much for his big debut into the MCU! (If I'd read that script I would have chucked it in the bin!) As were they all, yet somehow the less powerful heroes last longer (May I note they were women too!). My main gripe with these cameos is, what was the point of having them in there? To me it felt like a waste of time and money and in the end felt so pointless because they didn't bring in pre-existing characters from other universes which I was expecting. It was almost as if they went for it but then realised they couldn't afford it maybe? I don't know, I would have rather had them invest in returning characters such as vision (which would have made the film make way more sense!) and maybe even Hawkeye or Spider-Man who literally live in the same city this takes place!",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

The movie has its entertaining moments and is a pretty simple story to follow. But it also has some cringe worthy story lines throughout and some even more cringe worthy acting in parts. Of course the best parts include the different multiverse characters, but those moments are short lived. I was hoping there would be more Marvel Zombie action, but that turned out to be a huge disappointment with terrible CGI. It was almost laughable.

","Assorted Doctors Strange (Benedicts Cumberbatch) try to help America Chavez (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a young woman who can jump between domains in the multiverse and who is being pursued by malevolent entities under the direction of a rogue Avenger who covets the power. Less childish than other recent MCU outings, the second semi-solo outing of 'Earth's Supreme Sorcerer' is moderately entertaining but not particularly innovative or memorable. The CGI is spectacular but little clever is done with the concept of inter-universe travel (one particularly banal example has different coloured streetlights) and the entire premise, along with Strange's and The Scarlet Witch's vast occult powers, means that pretty much anything can happen, so it's hard to care about what does. Typical of the Disney era, MCU villains, no matter how wicked, end up redeemed (and their various PG-rated atrocities conveniently forgotten). The cast is fine playing comic-book characters, but Ejiofor isn't given much to do beyond being a human McGuffin (and ticking off a few boxes on Disney's current casting priorities). Presumably as a nod to director Sam Raimi's iconic frugal-spookers (like 1981's 'The Evil Dead'), there are some gratuitous (and ineffectual) horror-tropes thrown in (the zomboid return of a mutilated character suffers from second-rate makeup/CGI and there is a ridiculous scene where an arcane and all-powerful entity who can fly (and teleport) is suddenly reduced to lurching along on foot).

","I really love the way the movie looks visually with all the unique special effects and character designs along side all the superpowers and green screen effects. The SFX and BGM are VERY well made for whatever is happening in a scene. I love the characters with their unique personalities and lovable characteristics like for example, Wanda is super powerful and scary and menacing and wants to control and manipulate everyone in her path. Also Wanda as an antagonist of the film makes her very scary and threatening and EXTREMELLY POWERFUL AND DANGEROUS for anyone to face her head on, also she is relentless in trying to get her family back. The emotions in this movie do hit on a good level of strange with Christine and Wanda trying to get her family back and with America Chavez loosing her family and not knowing how to control her powers because if it. Also having another comic book superhero team like the illuminati is really cool to see them on the big screen with some new characters in there as well such as variations of other pre-existing avengers. Also i understand the motivation behind Wanda given that she lost everything she ever loved and cared about and that she's basically gone crazy from controlling an entire town full of innocent people with her mind and just wanting her own life by controlling everybody in the process and getting a look at the Dark hold book also corrupting her along with her always having the powers of the Scarlet witch along with Agatha Harkness actively telling her that her becoming evil is a crucial part of her future and her overall fate of existence as the scarlet witch so all of this combined to be the motives behind why Wanda is the main antagonist of the film makes a lot of sense in my opinion but it was also bound to happen at some point
other incarnations of Wanda Maximoff are in fact evil and demonic so this was honestly her destiny. Also the character development in this film is touching with strange wondering if he's happy with his life and universe compared to others that he could very much be a part of but he decides not to not only because of what he told peter before of him trying to life two separate lives is not the right way to life, and with Wanda as well for her finally seeing the error of her ways by seeing what she has become overtime and what her family would think of her if she returned to in the physical and mental condition she's in. The countless references to not only characters but also lines and locations is a ton of fun to just point of while i was watching, for example the whole ""earth's mightiest heroes"" line and having and also Clear showing up in the after credit's scene.

However, he doesn't do it with a silly or stupid way, but one that makes you chuckle, almost perversely, to the violence (something never seen to such extend in a Marvel movie, until now). Adding to that effect is the fact that he doesn't linger on senseless overuse of effects on the universes or character's abilities, but he uses them frugally, letting the characters carry the scenes.

","""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" (streaming 6.22, theatres 5.6.22, $390M in US + $520M intern'l) Opening scene, not on board with the social messaging that's not so subtle. Third scene, the fight with the giant octo-squid, and the latina aka America Chavez hasn't a scratch out of it, and she's just brimming with entitled confidence. And later when Strange says ""America doesn't have long"" (when she's in peril) you can't help but notice the double entendre. Then there's this whole magni-terrible Scarlet Witch who's really just a sweet mom at heart so we're being schooled that even the most terrible person in the multiverse has the heart of a mom. It seems very kid-friendly Disney in its polyannish optimism in the face of dire circumstances. The whole tunnel chase scene doesn't make sense given the magical power in play here. And there was a fair amount of magical book burning/destruction so is that book-industry messaging? Finally, how's it take three different attempts by the SW to drain America of her power - oh wow, is that a China draining America of its global power metaphor?! - over such a long period that provides enough time for Dr Strange to intervene. And these drainings apparently aren't cumulative which doesn't make sense. It's just so blatantly the-story-must-permit-the-good-guys-to-win regardless of plausibility. I'm sure if you're ages 10-15 you'll think this is just the best movie ever, but for the rest of humanity it's just CGI silliness.

But it turns out it was a dumpster fire. After i watched it in theaters, there were some major problems about this one and let me clear this out. The characters were great and especially the suprising cameos of a team called the illuminati which includes Captan Carter, Black Bolt, Black Captain Marvel, John Krasinski's Reed Richards AKA Mr. Fantastic and finally Patrick Stewart's Professor X. I thought they were gonna defeat scarlet witch that easily but it turned out they don't have the brains they used to have before. Like Captain Carter said ""I Can Do This All Day"" which is steve roger's line. And then the she got cut in half by her OWN shield! The illuminati began to fall apart when black bolt said ""I can destroy you with one whisper from my mouth and then his brain exploded by SW's powers. All of them are dumb deaths like Mr. Fantastic turns into spaghetti, Captain Marvel getting crushed by a statue and Prof. X getting his neck snapped by SW again. They all die quickly cuz of their arrogance. I like the characters and most of them are the original ones from the 1st movie like Mordo, Wong, Christine, etc. And i noticed the Ancient one wasn't in it. There are some cool tings too. The effects were cool and i like how there are other versions of strange. Sam Raimi directs the worthless sequel to one of my favourite superheroes.

1610,24 October 2022,dsampat-86173,4," A mess of madness
","This movie is a mess. Coming of a fantastic origin Dr. Strange's sequel sorely disappoints. Scott Derrickson's (the director of the first Dr. Strange) absence is felt and not even the highly touted Sam Rami can fix this disaster of a script. The film itself takes the most uninteresting approach to the multiverse one could imagine. Instead of exploring a vast amount of universes, each with their own physics, rules, and characters. The audience is treated to a lackluster plot surrounding the Scarlet Witch and at most two different worlds all too similar to the one we know. The positives of the movie are few. First the performances are well done, especially Benedict Cumberbatch and Elizabeth Olsen. Second, at times the action is unique. That is all, the rest is either mediocre or terrible. The movie begins with a frantic pace that does not let up. This might seem great but it leads to uninteresting exposition filled dialogue most of the time. There is so much happening that the characters have to explain more than they can marinate on their individual circumstances. The introduction of America Chavez is not done well, not only taking away from our titular protagonist but also lacking in the acting department as well. The action itself is also a disappointment, gone is the mind bending kaleidoscopic action of the first movie, replaced with mindless cg blasts. Dr. Stranges magic is more of a plot device here than it actually is magic with a set of rules and procedures. Sam Rami's horror elements do little to shake up the marvel formula and honestly a better director might have been needed. The most disappointing aspect is how the script itself treats Dr. Strange. The script makes him an unlikable and incompetent sorcerer. In fact in the finale he is not even involved in defeating the villain. The original Dr. Strange is my favorite MCU movie, and this was the biggest letdown in the MCU itself. Next time they should bring the original writers and director.

","No real spoilers, but I think going in with low expectations and understanding that Wanda has gone FULL VILLAIN will help you to enjoy the experience more. The Wanda you love from the Avengers, from WandaVision, flush her down the toilet she's gone psycho, and the ""reason"" they gave is unsatisfactory to me. You won't leave feeling uplifted, and I want that from a superhero movie personally, but it was epic, so if explosive visuals are why you're there you'll likely enjoy yourself, but just a heads up, Wanda is awful now, which I find jarring and depressing. Without being too specific, I think the movie was a missed opportunity in multiple ways, but it's a big epic feast for the eyes, not very kid friendly BTW, but I personally was on the edge of my seat in awe at everything happening, so you decide if/how/when to watch it, but I do not recommend with kids (darkest MCU chapter thus far for sure), and even though it was downright awesome at times, I'd probably rank it last among the MCU movies for me. I think lower expectations will make people enjoy it more. It's kind of amazing, but personally my least favorite. I guess the foremost problem I have is that they spent 5+ years building a character and disregarded her completely. I just feel like if they wanted to make the Scarlett Switch to villain, they could have done it in a way similar to WandaVision, where she is sort of selfish and abusive about getting what she wants in certain circumstances over certain issues with certain people, rendering her a complicated and interesting relatable character, without being a one-dimensional unrecognizable indiscriminately murderous PSYCHO. They did her such a disservice, it's like Raimi & Co. Didn't even watch WandaVision. Couldn't she just ask America to take her to a different dimension??? That's what the Wanda would have done that they previously introduced. I just don't vibe with the core premise and what they did to Wanda and how they ""resolved"" it in the end... terribly weak ending IMHO. Another curiously uncoordinated Phase 4 entry, and with one singular exciting end-credit-sequence, it did basically nothing to introduce a new overarching story, yet again, a surprising failure at universe building from the people who we all previously considered the infallible masterminds of that. Don't get me wrong, it is an amazing movie in a lot of ways, but simultaneously it nevertheless is a dark heavy incongruent storytelling cul-de-sac that lasted over two hours and ultimately didn't add much of anything to the MCU.

","Vision said that in ""Infinity War."" So it is with the MCU. Let's accept it. They had a solid 10+ year run with over 20 very entertaining movies with mostly good scripts. But now, Thor The Dark World--once panned for its bottom of the barrel script--is now joined by these latest installments from Marvel Studios. Indeed, it would appear that the machine that thrilled us for over a decade has ground to a halt like a murder-bot without juice. Having taken its historic run of successes for granted and accepted any hackneyed storyline and script as acceptable for its multi-billion dollar fanbase. This fan wonders; was there ever a discussion in some boardroom where someone said: ""Michael Waldron? Really? Do we really want to trust our huge fan base to his FIRST movie script?"" OR, ""Isn't Sam the same horror movie director who 14 years ago pretty much sank our most popular character, Spider-Man?"" Perhaps the exec who thought these things was sitting next to Baron Zemo who promptly silenced them. Who can know what goes into toppling an empire? But the crumble is on full display.

There is some creative monster design at work here, particularly in the third act involving ghastly monsters and Evil Dead-style reanimation, and some of the angled and POV shots again invoke the director's most famous horror flicks. Sadly, most of the time it tries to be a blockbuster Marvel movie, and that's where the movie becomes tiresome really quick. The film opens in medias res with a kinetic action scene, but it's hard to care amidst the heavy use of dazzlingly numbing CGI. As the title suggests, the movie ventures into multiple world's, but its exploration and integration into the plot feels rushed and underutilized, especially compared to Spiderman Into the Spider-Verse. The plot also brings back a particular Marvel TV favorite in what's supposed to be a tragic villainous turn, and while knowledge of their past material isn't strictly necessary, the movie's most emotionally resonant scenes feel hollow without it. Along the way, the movie doesn't forget to shoehorn and set up other well-known Marvel IPs, but being this deep into Phase 4 (or is it Phase 5?

","I was a huge fan of the original Doctor Strange film and am a Marvel Cinematic Universe megafan, and I'm deeply disappointed in this sequel. It serves no purpose. It's like a rehashing of Wandavision, which was an incredibly interesting look at the excruciating stages of grief in a superhero/magical being combined with a rehashing of ""Doctor Strange learns to be a whole human being"" that I thought we saw worked out in his first film. So, why does this exist? I had been hoping perhaps this film would dovetail in the Strange we saw in No Way Home, who acted so impulsively and recklessly as to set off events for that amazing story arc. I really did. I thought perhaps we'd discover the two movie timelines overlapped and the Strange we saw in that wasn't ""our"" Strange the entire time, but...no. Here we get an evil Wanda (really, I'm so mad about her downgrade to villain I could spit nails) and an ego-tripping Strange treading so much non-plot water that seems to only exist to give Sam Raimi a chance to ruin yet another superhero movie with weird horror, campy ham handedness and zero nuance. Hoping for cameos by other new multiverse characters? Oh, they're there...for a moment before most are shredded to death by Wanda. So why bring them in at all? And I couldn't help thinking over and over, if Wanda became so powerful from her ascension to Scarlet Witch, but remained so gut-wrenchingly lonely, why didn't she just make another pocket reality for just her, involving no one else (since we know she can, and she also knows she can now) where Vision and the twins are real to her...instead of trying to rampage at her own peril through multiverses to find another set of her sons? Wouldn't it have been immediately fulfilling and less fraught? And do we get just endless cycles from here on out of Strange becoming cocky yet fragile, suffering, then reaching an epiphany?

","The biggest issue I have with this film is the treatment of Wanda (scarlet witch). Wandavision was superb, the best LIVE ACTION superhero show I've seen, but this film felt like such a disservice to her character. It felt as though they'd gotten bored of this version of her and wanted to get rid, which is a huge mistake, as she's so unique and interesting. What didn't make sense in this film was that wandavision was all about her trying to have a life with vision, including kids. In this, it's like she forgot Vision entirely and just moved on and focused on the kids... which makes no sense to me. Surely in one of the universes where her kids exist, Vision would too? She was just as obsessed with Vision as she was about her kids, so she'd surely want both? It just felt like someone behind the scenes had gone, ""well, we're part of Disney now. Let's go with the evil mother trope and leave it at that."" Also, the film felt incredibly sexist. In Wanda's own words- ""You break the rules and you become the hero. I do it and I become the enemy. That doesn't seem fair."" Yeah, it's not fair Wanda, why is it that when you get the super powered evil book, everyone's after you and thinks you're a monster, but when strange gets it, he somehow ends up being ok? Yeah, we saw in one or two universes the book corrupting him, but in our universe, he has somehow mastered its effects, whereas Wanda couldn't. Was Wanda too emotional to handle the book? Massive eye roll. I just hate how they built scarlet witch up to be this crazy powerful unstoppable force that was going somewhere and then they just got rid of her, like, move over scarlet witch, dr strange is the real boss, we're bored of your love sick girly whining.

The other cameos are amazing so I won't spoil them as well. Sam Raimi did a good job directing this film. He directed the Spider-Man trilogy and it's no wonder that Marvel wanted him to come back and direct another superhero film. Danny Elfman's composing for this film is phenomenal.

And it's a nitpick, but why would the children she invented exist in other universes? I mean, I guess because plot necessity.

","The Mouse House's latest Marvel MCU chapter has our master of the mystic arts journeying through the multiverse (hence the title) to protect a being, Xochitl Gomez, who can transport herself through the verse using star shaped portals, & is being pursued by the newly asserted Scarlet Witch, Elizabeth Olsen, who wants to usurp her power to save her sons (established in the WandaVision series). Sam Raimi returns to the fold as the director (after having directed the Tobey Maguire Spideys in the aughts) after original director Scott Derrickson (who helmed the first Strange) departed the project due to creative differences & as a piece of entertainment, I thought it worked but rumblings are underway that maybe the MCU's interconnectedness may be fraying at the seams as the roster of films released so far (& to be released) during this Phase 4 (?) must connect w/the on going TV series (which have been pretty damn good so far sans Loki which I didn't care for) & beyond. Not a likely position for me to envy but hey unlike DCU (at this point it may change w/the Discovery channel merger now a factor for their upcoming output) which seemed to have thrown up their hands in surrender to let directors direct, giving their slate individual touches which may not be necessarily found in the Marvel camp but as long as the audience's appetite hasn't slackened for their product, they will continue to forge ahead which only time will tell if it's a sound decision.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

Again, sadly, this MU genre is typified by violence; allegedly endorsed by heroic figures who primarily save and solve critical problems with violence. Essentially, MU movies lurch from one dire situation to another; whereby, superheroes solve and save the non-heroic general population from various critical problems - usually alien threats, seeking to extinguish mankind's existence. Thus, the viewer is entirely primed to assume, more or less, the ends justify the means, in terms of the heroes' conduct. Failure is a zero sum game, and the human race and Earth, are accordingly, situated as significant and important; such that, aliens or similar architypes feel compelled to invade or menace humanity accordingly.

","Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness looked and felt like a proper MCU film. The story ran at a fast pace. The set-ups happened one on top of the other and fight scenes were frequent in between the narrative expositions. The character arcs in the film were interesting indeed. But as much as the film has Dr. Strange as the main protagonist, it was Wanda's film as it really gave her a huge amount of focus. It felt as though somehow Dr Strange took a backseat in favor of America and Wanda. He was still pretty cool using his magic, but he did not have the same impact from before. The way Multiverse of Madness handled the concept of multiverse was satisfying. There are cameos of alternate versions of characters that appeared in the film. Among them are two of the most anticipated characters to appear in the MCU. It is arguable that the way they were utilized was undermining. The film set pieces were also definitely a Marvel product. It was complete with big CGI background and fights and colorful production set. But it is noteworthy how good the transition was in the scene where Strange and America travel to different universes. Everything happened in mere seconds yet so many things were presented. Kudos to the visual effects and editing team for that scene. As far as performance go, Benedict Cumberbatch and Elizabeth Olsen were the stand outs. On the whole, MoM worked as a standalone film with only minimum references to other MCU films.

But, do not let that rating fool you, it has some really intense, violent and gruesome scenes that made the experience so much better! And just to let you know, this film is NOT a Cameo After Cameo Movie, but the surprises it does have, are enough for me, as it spent the other amount of time building the story, BUT I wish the film was longer! It was really short to take all this Madness in, and maybe could've sprinkled in a few more Universes if the runtime let it. The Overall story is simple and easy to follow, and that title suits the movie really perfectly, as it is MADNESS! It's probably one of the darkest Comic-Book-Movies of all time, and the visuals are stunning! It's a little messy when it gets into the whole Multiverse thing in the middle, but it has such creative ideas and scenes, that makes it so damn entertaining!",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

In short: a powerful sorcerer must face a witch traumatized by the loss of children she never had, while out of nowhere appears a girl who travels from universe to universe whose importance to the story is zero. Here the great protagonist is the trauma of wanting to be a mother and not being able to experience it in the reality that corresponds to us. Then a lot of things happen that involve death, destruction, the disappearance of universes, the appearance of fantastic creatures and all of that could have been resolved by going to the psychiatrist. On the other hand we have a tribute to Star Wars since a black traitor appears who in turn is supported by robots that look like C-3PO; Billy Dee Williams should be happy. The mental smallness of the characters is inconceivable: Dr. Strange cannot overcome his bad luck in love, the villain of the story should be in an insane asylum and her delusions do not support the movie and the young Latina is as transcendent as a zero .

I didn't expect that from Raimi, who normally prefers practical effects. Looking at the title of the film, I think that its full potential was not used, except for a very cool (what else to call it) scene in the middle of the film that was obviously made for fans, but overall the film does not contribute anything.

","The Good- Now Sam Rami is easily one of the most influential and important directors in the comic book movie. In this film Sam Rami shows what he can do when give creative freedom. Fair enough the opening act has the same old MCU formula like most of its films. But in the second and third act he is able to really showcase what he can do as a director, not only in the comic book genre but also t horror genre as well. I was surprised how dark they could go with this film while also still being able to keep it as a PG-13. We continue to explore the heartbreak of Wanda's journey. Elizabeth Olsen continues to showcase the her acting range as she shows this heartbroken character that is also terrifying. While the plot is a follow up to WandaVision, the character ark and exploration is focused on Doctor Strange and you get a clear idea of where he is at post-Endgame and how he has evolved as a character since that first Doctor Strange film. The new addition to this film America Chavez, who is essentially used as a plot device, is a plot device done right. Although she is there to move the plot forward she has the charm and chemistry with Doctor Strange and is enjoyable to watch on screen but her set of powers are used to move the plot forwards. Lastly we're going to talk about the cameos. Now unlike No Way Hone this film isn't built on the idea of merging three different franchises together that being said there were obviously opportunities to bring back some familiar faces. And when these sequences happened I had a massive grin across my face. One face certainly caught me off guard that I did not expect.

The film has one of the most boring scripts I've ever witnessed, I mean the dialogue was so cheesy with the occasional hokey MCU jokes that are clearly meant for 10 year olds.. Stephen strange took a backseat to his own film. I love the female protagonists and antagonist of comic based stories , but Kevin feige is clearly entertaining something toxic in our community. The stories are becoming almost too political to the point where stories aren't even making sense. Like I said Dr. Strange was in the backseat of his own film.. I had to go home and literally flush the BS out by watching a decent comic book movie (it was the Batman by the way). The MCU hit its peak with infinity war and endgame.. if this is a sneak peak of the future of this once great brand, NO THANK YOU.

The weakest point of the story is there is no reasonable fact that Wanda becomes Scarlet Witch as well as no reasonable fact that she becomes the Wanda again.

I think America maybe should have had an orgin show or movie, and made the bulk of Wanda's story for WandaVison season 2. I left wanting more Strange!

","Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is the long-awaited sequel to the first Dr. Strange, as well as the follow-up to Spiderman No Way Home. Now, I was actually really anticipating this movie. My interest in the MCU had been pretty low since Endgame. I think Phase 4 has been a disappointment overall, especially after seeing this. However, I did enjoy No Way Home and that boosted my interest level a bit. As a result, I was pretty excited for this film, despite being pretty underwhelmed by the first Dr. Strange. Sadly, underwhelmed is the word I would also use to describe this one. I would even say this is my least favorite film of Phase 4 so far. Granted, I haven't seen Morbius (nor do I wish to) and Thor 4 could be worse still. As of now, this is the weakest. I wouldn't say it's the weakest MCU movie, though it is on the low end of the spectrum.

The film directed by Sam Raimi definitely has a Sam Raimi feeling to it but while I'm sure they thought this would add to the marvel feel, it doesn't. I'll start of on a good point, the design of the Scarlet witch costume was very good. That's where it ends. The rest of the film feels cheaply wrote and cheaply pulled together with gimmicky cameos. There is no consistancy with previous marvel storyline. For a start, the variants of Dr strange from alternate universes are all Benedict Cumberbatch. In loki the variants of loki are everything from female to crocodiles. Aside from the inconsistancy in the story line, there is also strange sequences where it sways suddenly to an 80s horror theme. In the scene when strange is being chased down a maintence shaft by the scarlet witch. She very suddenly develops a zombie like leg drag as she chases them.

I would have given 10 stars, but lots of trailer scenes were cut, and they were some really good scenes. Sam Rami returns big time, making this the first Marvel horror movie.(Secretly hoping they do a zombie movie. I would actually watch that, since I fear zombies.) But this review is primarily about that last scene, at the end of the credit roll. I think that, besides Tony doing that ""snap"", not wanting to do it, because he's finally happy, but, because he's a true hero at heart, is willing to sacrifice his life for all those who were lost after the first ""snap"". That, to me, is one of any movies most poignant moments. The end credit scene with Bruce Campbell almost tops that moment.

","It's a great movie if you like watching your favorite famous people move their hands in weird ways to shoot big red CGI orbs at each other during fight scenes. In between those parts, it's a highly convoluted time jumping/universe hopping story centered around Wandavision wanting to see her kids, who have the hilariously uncreative names of Billy and Tommy. The protagonist (who somehow feels like he has second billing to Wanda), Dr. Strange, a time-traveling British guy who is a Doctor who isn't a Doctor Who, is mostly on screen to move his hands, shoot CGI things out of his hands at people, and be sarcastic when he's not asking people questions about what he is supposed to be doing-at one point in an extremely dialogue-heavy expositional scene, he asks John Krasinski how he can get to a book he's looking for that is incredibly crucial to drive the story forward. John Krasinski reminds Strange that he made himself a huge loophole out of like, time warp magic or something that allows him to just get directly to the book, which we never saw onscreen or heard about at any point beforehand. It's just tossed in to bail out whoever wrote themselves into a corner with the screenplay. Dr. Strange is pretty much just like, ""oh yeah, that's right!"" and the movie shamelessly plows forward (it prompted a huge belly laugh from me and is far and away my favorite part of this movie).",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

","In the end, I was quite disappointed. Visually, it's a blast at certain moments and it's a blast to watch. But that's where it kind of ended for me. The music was good, but nothing that made me sit my ass down. The action scenes were great too, but then again, there have been better ones in Marvel. It was the story that took the biggest hit. It's pretty weak in my opinion, and unfortunately this vice is starting to repeat itself. I first noticed this with Spider-Man: No Way Home, but it didn't matter in the finale, because it was all taken care of by a trio of our favorite Spider-Men who pulled the whole movie off, and besides, the action was on another level with better music. I actually noticed this earlier with Venom: Let There Be Carnage, where it just didn't quite work out. Then after a while came the failed Morbius and now this. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness came out even better thanks to its aforementioned visuals, which made the film interesting. Otherwise, it would probably have been above average. It's a shame. I understand that they want to show us something grandiose in the form of effects at every corner, but we shouldn't forget about the quality of the plot, which I don't think is bad here, but definitely weaker compared to other Marvel movies. Historically, this has been done in Avengers: Infinity War, for example, where action and good looks were plentiful while not forgetting a good plot with a good story. Here, it went a bit to hell for me as far as the writing goes, and in my opinion, that's the biggest minus of the new Doctor Strange. For me, a good movie that I recommend more to just the bigger fans of the Marvel world. For the average viewer, I would only recommend this movie if they want some eye candy and aren't looking for a deeper plot.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

","With the combination of Sam Rami's direction, Danny Elfman's score and Cumberbatch I started the viewing very optimistic, visually great, had a feel of the first 3 spider-man films (very positive). Sadly the story was a mess. Without Cumberbatch it would have been lost completely, luckily he has the gravitas to hold the screen like a true star, and like all of Stan's originals is a fantastic character unlike most that Disney have served up recently. We all know why Marvel/Disney have introduced Z list characters and killed of the big named 'old white stale males' but unfortunately like it or not those are the characters that made Marvel Marvellous. An example of this briefly appears in this film: The Illuminati are the greatest minds of the Marvel universe and leaders of their respective groups, in this Namor and Black Panther (quite easily could have been Kilmonger in this alternate universe) and Tony Stark were replaced by Peggy Carter as Cap and Captain Marvel (Monica Rambeau version), Neither renowned for either their genius or the fact they're a leader of a team, but they did tick the diversity box, so that's what counts. Pleased that see that John Krasinski has taken the role or Richard's, but strangely seemed anticlimactic.

In fact when we left the theatre, my young daughters friend had tears in her eyes. ""It was so gory"" she said. She wasn't wrong. I also left the theatre unsettled and disturbed by what I just watched. Not that I have a problem with horror, but if I want to see a horror film, I would go see a horror film. I was here with my kids for a big-screen adaption of a superhero comic. Instead, this movie just left a bad taste in my mouth.

It took me out of the experience whenever the pacing would start falling off. Another issue I have are the cameos. No spoilers but the cameos weren't worth it for the decisions the movie makes with those cameos. There's also some character issues like for ""Mordo"".

The relationship between America and strange just felt so forced like they were going for a tony and Tom relationship but it just wasn't there. To be honest, it felt more like a cameo of America in this movie than her being a costar. Elizabeth Olsen played Wanda amazing in this but her script was arguably the best part about the movie. Most of the fights in the movie we're phenomenal (especially involving Wanda). Also, supreme strange was a huge let down in my opinion with a lame fight.

","Although this movie is called ""multiverse of madness"" the writing was straight madness and directing as well. The moment I saw this in theaters I knew that Wanda/scarlet witch wasn't going to win. Due to the catastrophic result if she were to win. The entire multiverse would be enslaved. So quite frankly they needed a better plot or more engaging story. Like in the most recent batman film (2022) they did an excellent job at capturing fear and mystery. The story wasn't so catastrophic that we can't even comprehend. It's simple but yet ominous. Although the riddler lost, we were not ready at all for the flooding that he caused. It was such a twist and created interest. However doctor strange was just lazy and unentertaining, with corny lines and a corny story. As well as crazy unexplained items and characters in the story, if you are not familiar with the comics you will have practically no idea what's happening. There's a book of vishanti, a demonic eye with tentacles, a plain and boring character who can travel through the multiverse, and Scarlett witch who wants to absorb her power. And then there's dream walking, the dark hold, the Illuminati, fan service. AND ON TOP OF THAT, the multiverse strange and Chavez teleport to is just the most boring and plain layout they could ever do. For Christs sake we could have been in a paint multiverse, but no a multiverse where there's lot of wild life, ""free"" food and different colored lights. This entire film was poorly made and written, and will be just an average film. What marvel did EXCELLENT with infinity war is that the villain won!

2241,27 June 2022,MoviesWithX,7," It's kind of like Doctor Strange's ""Iron Man 2"", if that makes sense.
","I'll explain what I mean with my headline on top. I like the films that came before the sequels more, not to mention both sequels seemed to have stuff cut out of them. And also, Iron Man 2 was essentially a setup movie for ""The Avengers"", while this movie has cameos from people who will most likely be seen again in some capacity. Sam Raimi says that 35 minutes of footage was cut out of the film before release and I feel like that probably hurt the quality of this movie for me personally. The stuff that was cut out probably could have resolved some of the issues that are present with the released cuts of the two respective movies. I thought this movie was fine and it was an enjoyable, breezy entertainment at best. And while I don't really try to get on any hype trains these days for anything, the MCU has set a bar that is too high to release a movie that's just ok. I love the visual effects. I honestly think they are some of the best that I have ever seen and they honestly deserve to win an Academy Award for the work they've done. Sam Raimi did an amazing job directing this film and I liked his style and how it gave this movie something that you haven't seen much of in other Marvel movies. I enjoyed all of the efforts from the cast. The action is fun and chaotic, and that's something that you can come to expect in these movies. But I was just underwhelmed by it, and confused at times too. Even trying to keep up with it, I still just felt lost. And not only that I even just started to get a little bored with it. I actually got tired of Scarlet Witch towards the end. The mid and post-credits sequence were all right. I preferred the post-credits one. And that leads me actually to the humor in the movie which honestly wasn't the most forced in my opinion, and it doesn't seem like there was that much either but I didn't really react to that much of it. Only time I really laughed was from a cameo by a certain someone that's probably been revealed because the internet has dumped everything about this movie already onto it. And Marvel didn't help much either with that with the stuff that got out. One thing I definitely have to give this movie though is that it is in no way in my opinion a carbon copy of the first film in my opinion. The darker tone and Raimi's direction do help it to stand apart from the first film. I honestly wouldn't watch it again though. It's got less to do with expectations and more to do with ""I watched it and I just didn't think it was all that"". I felt like it could have been a lot better.

2263,4 May 2022,hazartemizel,7," A good film but Marvel made us expect more
","With multiverse first being shown as a thing in Spider Man, I was really expecting to see a huge movie with more or less every single Marvel film ever made (I know it's a huge ask but come on, it's Marvel so why not). A lot had been introduced to the fans in the trailers as well, which built up my expectations. However, it turns out (kind of a spoiler alert) they had shown us almost all of the surprising parts, and the rest was more or less cameos only. I was expecting more like a team up event like Avengers as, I thought, we are already introduced to lots of superheroes and they would have similar counterparts in other universes, as well the villains and there are lots of others who we have yet to see on screen, but it was more like Dr Stranges from other universes vs Scarlet Witch, which was still cool but it did not meet my expectations. Also, the CGI was a bit sloppy at times, which sometimes is, but when it is a Dr Strange movie, it makes it a bit more weird I think as there is lots of CGI involved. Lastly, I liked the villain story this time, and seeing a previous super hero turn into a villain was cool, but at the end, I really felt the battle was too easy and short, and there could have been so much more done with the power both Dr Strange and Scarlet Witch had. Anyways, if I had gone into the theater expecting a regular movie with the same jokes done every 2 minutes, I would have probably been blown with the movie I had encountered (don't get me wrong, I have still enjoyed the film very much), but as I was lead to expect more and more by Marvel, I felt a bit underwhelmed.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

Also using Chavez for traveling was bad idea, cringe and super boring. Wanda shouldn't be the villain of the movie, if i wanted to see WandaVision season 2 then i would. Moreover we see in this movie absolute zero multi dimensional threats, cause the monsters Strange face are created from boring Wanda. Also the transition of Wanda to Scarlet Witch reminds me of Danny from Game of thrones. It doesn't make sense to kill so many innocent people and becoming a villain in such a short amount of time.

2277,7 May 2022,Ham9000,6," First Thoughts
","Doctor Strange In The MoM was surprisingly an entertaining experience. It was still a painfully average Marvel flick, but it at least had a distinct style and tone compared to other entries in the MCU. Elizabeth Olsen was really good in the role as a deranged Scarlet Witch, she really expressed the character's insecurities better here than she did in WandaVision. However, I wished she received a better resolution rather than having her get crushed by a crumbling tower. I was happy to see Danny Elfman compose a good score again; it's certainly not his best, but it does regain the passion and energy that was lost in his recent scores. I was also impressed with the fact that they introduced Mr Fantastic and Professor X but then they get the most brutal deaths that I wouldn't expect in a Marvel property. Once Professor X was introduced, a kid in my theater yelled out ""First Fantastic Four, and now X-Men? This is a Marvel movie not an X-Men movie!"" I guess you could say the audience reactions enhanced the film for me because it was just full of confused children questioning the absurd events that take place on the screen. Sam Raimi's long return to the silver screen is a welcoming one at that, but there were certainly moments that felt held back and Disney formulated. Sam Raimi has proven that he can conceive a PG-13 horror film with 'Drag Me To Hell', which is another Raimi film on a whole new level of insanity. I really liked how this film experimented with different stylistic choices, but there were still moments and characters that dragged the film down. America was not a very compelling character; her entire personality is that she has a tragic backstory where she was startled by a bee and forms a multiverse portal that sucks in her two lesbian moms. There sure were stupid moments like this, but they weren't offensively bad to the point where I completely despised it. This movie blew my mind just like how Blackbolt blew his own mind, it was a chaotic good old time. I'm curious what the future for Doctor Strange will look like, it sure can't get crazier from here.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

The premise is fun but ultimately wasted, the title of this film should be; Dr Strange FALLS through the multiverse of madness. The concept is literally only elaborated on for a single scene. This film in no way is a trek through the multiverse. The statement is practically false. As stated they Dr Strange falls through the multiverse for one chaotic scene that is all! While a version of the Illuminati appears they are dispersed within 15 minutes to the ultimate detriment of the story. This is glorified connective tissue; to a plot thread from WANDAVISION. While ok in theory if the viewer is unfamiliar with WANDAVISION then this hardly acts as emphasis to watch that material (you just saw its epilogue in a way). This film being unfortunately an advertisement for a DISNEY+ program makes DS2 forgettable. The film should have followed the character Nightmare like speculation originally entailed.

","Unlike the previous installments of the MCU which made good use of previous world building in establishing their story, Doctor Strange 2 instead crammed too much new exposition into the movie, making the story so violently overpaced that the audience does not have time to digest, and the end product could only be seen as a forgettable fast-forwarded story with little weight. This is situation is exacerbated by Marvel's attempt in making something new with horror elements and a darker tone, which itself is commendable, yet when mixed with out of tune Marvel humour, purposeless characters and poor editing, this movie can only be seen as an inconsistent multiversal mess that one would hope that a better version exists among the vast realities.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022
2316,6 May 2022,sophaljonesy,8," A wild trip with more Rachel McAdams, Elizabeth Olsen, action and you can actually feel afraid for Dr Strange.
","Given the title Multiverse of Madness, and having Sam Raimi directing it, I was excited about the movie. Here are things I enjoyed about the movie. First, there is more Rachel McAdams. McAdams is a very talented actress and her talent was criminally wasted in the first Dr Strange. Here, she plays a more important role in the story, and I love every bit of it. Second, there is more Elizabeth Olsen. I have not seen her TV series (not everyone can access Disney Plus), and I always felt that Olsen's character is very under-used. Here, Olsen is able utilize her acting skills, and her character gets to use her powers even more. Third, there are tons of action. There are magical fights, and martial arts. I am surprised Dr Strange knows martial arts on top of magic. I also love the cameos. They were great fun. There are some Sam Raimi trademarks. We have the moving cameras, horror elements, and gore. There were times, I actually feel frightened for Dr Strange, and this is why the movie works. Dr Strange is just a guy who knows magic and he is actually challenged. You know he will win, (this being a superhero movie), but his abilities are stretched. He has to use his wit, magic, and fighting skills in order to save the multiverse. The only main problem about the movie, was I was expecting more universes involved. Though Dr Strange does travel through universes, the scope feels very limited. Another thing is that we care more about the villain than our protagonist. Dr Strange has problems, but Raimi seems more focused on the Strange running around than having the audience care about him. This is a drawback to the story because it could have elevated the story much more. But in the end I love the movie, and if you are an Evil Dead fan, you will love this. There are scenes which pay homage to the Evil Dead series too.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

Upon the first viewing I was quite frankly FRIGHTENED by the film as it developed, it is actually a horror film in its own right. But, Elizabeth Olsen is by far the ENGINE of this story, and her portrayal of the tragic fall of Wanda Maximof ranks amongst the greatest portrayals of a fallen from grace WORLDS GREATEST hero. I didn't realize how sad I was to see her eaten alive by power, although it was fueled by a twisted love. Benetict Cumberbatch was wonderful as well as newcomer Xochil Gomez as who is really great as an UPDATED VERSION OF ACCESS (Axel Asher) for us oldies WHO REMEMBER WHO ACCES WAS!

2319,7 May 2022,zeutziusz,10," Pure Comic Book Perfection
","Several times now, Marvel Studios have taken concepts that, at a time, seemed far too ""out there"" & ""comic book-y"" to be put to film, and brought those concepts to life in ways that have made hardcore fans say ""I can't believe this film exists"". The Avengers, Avengers: Infinity War, Avengers: Endgame, Spider-Man: No Way Home, and, now Doctor Strange In The Multiverse of Madness. Marvel have once again crafted something that I can't believe exists as a mainstream blockbuster. This film is so unbelievably ""comic book-y"" and, like with The Batman, one of the best things about this film is that it's not for everyone; it doesn't go out of it's way to be as widely palatable as possible to cater to casual moviegoers. Rather, this film sticks firmly to the outlandish concepts that it presents and never feels ashamed of wholly embracing the fact that it's is a comic adaptation. Even better, the story itself is gripping even without all of the immensely satisfying inclusions. All of those fun surprises are just frosting on top of an already well-baked cake! However, with all of the madness and grand ideas, this film never loses sight of the fact that it is, primarily, a Doctor Strange story, and manages to serve the character terrifically! It is everything you could ever want from a Doctor Strange flick (and everything I DID want from the first one)! The film remains tonally consistent, and said tone feels fresh within this genre. Sam Raimi proves that he is still the king of this genre, providing truly impeccable direction. Michael Waldron's script is gripping, heartfelt, and wildly exciting. Danny Elfman provides some of his best work EVER (which is saying something)! Every actor brings their A-Game. The visuals are gorgeous, which is refreshing in an era of poor CGI. The creativity displayed in certain set-pieces in truly breathtaking. All in all, Doctor Strange In The Multiverse of Madness is the kind of film that I just can't quite believe exists and I absolutely DO NOT have enough good things to say about it. 10/10.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

C+ at best, it move to fast in the beginning but was great even doe they spent to long fighting the one eyed octopus which was very pointless because clearly the dream leading up to them meeting establish a connection between them which was good to me if they would have killed the monster and a shorter time and would have great but to drag the fight on so long was complete overkill but the first act of the movie is a A, the middle part of the movie dragged if you don't follow the other movies or certain shows you won't understand and maybe get lost I got a little lost and I look at everything marvel but luckily Wanda was the glue for the middle act frfr she kept it together, the middle act it's a B-, The ending wasn't as good as the beginning the ending wasn't good it was soso at best frfr the story line wasn't as interesting as I felt it would have some people died to easily for my liking personally why introduce the Illuminati if your gonna just do what they did to them low key spoiler they should have kept professor X alive killing off black bolt and Captain marvel not bad but to kill off professor X, Captain and Mr. Fantastic him self was pointless to me for the story line not cool at all I'm shocked vision wasn't in it very disappointing on that end but I agree it is a average movie it's a 7 or 8 on a scale from 1 to 10, the jump scare was pretty dope I wish was craven was alive OMG 😱 and the acting everyone did their thing but the lady who stole the movie to me was whoever the girl was who played America Chavez I love it.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

Cumberbatch as Strange wasn't the problem, he was trying his best with the material he was given. The plot was kind of the issue. The plot is in the synopsis on Imdb. The part that angered me the most was they had a scene where they had alternate version/ returning actor characters from previous and upcoming marvel properties appear, just to waste them in a matter of 5 minutes. The one major surprise I got out of this was Scarlet Witch as the villain which was ok, but still could have been fleshed out better. This new America Chavez character was ok, I guess, Wong was still entertaining and the effects were decent, but I kind of expected more out of this film. I hope Marvel learns from this with their next multiverse project and does better.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

","So I had high hopes for this movie and was pretty disappointed. The movie starts off very abruptly, but then does not scale back to give a nice building foundation to what will happen later. I found that the biggest areas of concern were pacing and editing. I am sure there were lots of behind the scene disagreements between the director and Disney, as the first 1.5 acts of this film felt like a sci-fi/superhero film, and then the rest progressed to an attempt to make a horror film. The plot itself was a bit sloppy, and I wish they had committed to making a Marvel horror movie rather than the tug-of-war between genres that was produced.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

The emotional core of this Doctor Strange movie is Wanda, and i think that works. I didn't love seeing her kill everyone, because i like her as a character and i didn't want to see her become the big bad, but i think that continuing to explore her pain and grief, even new grief at the loss if her kids, is part of what makes the mcu movies compelling.

","The newest entry in the MCU is a modern throwback to mid 2000's superhero films, and is undeniably a Sam Rami movie. His distinctive style presenting itself throughout, in the form of horrific chaos, including zombies, creatures, witches, monsters, and more. Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness was put in a tough spot, shortly following what is quite possibly the greatest multiverse film ever made in Daniels ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"", and of course the shadow left by ""Spider-Man No Way Home"" is present as well. Rami makes this film his own, and was obviously unafraid to take risks throughout. Some decent cinematography, intoxicating visuals, and solid camera work are all occasionally paired alongside the MCU's usual downright bad visual effects and rudimentary camera work, as well as a script filled with poor dialogue and plot holes. The refreshing factor here is that there is at least originality taking place, as well as the obvious presence of the care that Rami and his team put into this production. It certainly isn't perfect, and is quite flawed, but it's a fun time, and has some Intriguing film making happening.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

","Dr. Strange and the Multiverse of Madness really lives up to the word sequel. Many sequel movies end up ruining the story and many times the companies end up restarting the story and we have seen this with many superhero movies and action movies. For example movies whose sequels ended their stories in failure like Transformers, Pirates of the Caribbean, Die Hard, Terminator, They are that example of killing a good story. Dr. Strange was the opposite with this sequel, the incredible special effects, the music by Danny Elfman, the direction by Sam Raimi, the cinematography and how many things well done make this movie give it the honor of being a good sequel. And I could also say that Elizabeth Olsen is undoubtedly a great actress and has shown it once again in her role as Wanda / Scarlet Witch.

2542,8 May 2022,fzdjcpm,8," Should've been a 10
","Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is another solid entry in the MCU, However it was quite underwhelming for what it was hyped up to be. From the trailers a fan speculation I thought this movie was going to be a deep dive into the weirdness and craziness of the MCU multiverse. It turned out to be more of introduction into the Multiverse rather then a deep dive. Now this isn't marvels fault as the fans heavily drove the narrative that this movie would be an groundbreaking MCU event. It's just disappointing that a movie called the ""Multiverse of Madness ""barley explored the multiverse. Another thing disappoint about this film is Dr. Strange has the least interesting storyline in this movie. Wandas and America Chavez both have infinitely better character arcs then strange does. In terms of plot Dr. Strange gets outplayed by both his supporting cast which sucks because Dr. Strange has been such a good supporting character and now he finally has a chance to shine as a lead and didn't deliver. All though Strange's Story is rather uninteresting he's just as badass and ignorant as before. The way he uses magic in this movie is so creative and so top teir . My final main criticism of this movie is that it didn't commit to the horror vibe it was originally going to have. If plot that is fairly dark the tone of the movie didn't properly match it. You can see the horror elements all over this movie but the movie doesn't embrace this. It was like there was a tug of war if the movie wanted to be upbeat and uplifting or if it wouldn't to be dark and horror. If they would've fully did not even a horror movie but kept the dark tone from start to finish, we are looking at 9-10 teir movie without a doubt. Even with the criticism this movie is not bad or horrible. It does have prolly my favorite cameo/introduction of a character in the mcu and is very bloody. Wanda continues to prove why she is one of the greatest characters in the MCU with another amazing performance but At the end of the day this movie wasn't as great as it should've been.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

The movie had potential for good cameo characters but they just killed them off right away. The plot wasn't anything interesting and was just boring.

In all honesty, it was such a horrifying movie that I'm entirely turned off from watching any Marvel movies at the theater ever again!

","All in all, this was an okay but enjoyable film that lacked much to set it apart from any other marvel movie and at parts kind of dragged along, as well as feeling rather disjointed and too ambitious at times. The concept of a movie travelling all across the multiverse is very interesting, though like the multiverse, can get complicated fast. There were high ambitions, but almost too ambitious, because there was way too much going on at once. Eventually all the different plot lines kept building up until a breaking point. Despite this, the plot was often predictable. Where this movie did great was visually. Some scenes had lots of visual interest, such as scenes used to show the turmoil in the Scarlet Witch's mind, at one point making her entire home go crazy, with light fixtures flickering and cabinets opening on their own accord. Another visually interesting scene was when they were travelling through different dimensions in the multiverse and they encounter one where the entire dimension is made of paint. Like previously mentioned, parts like this are the highlight of the movie. Part of where this movie went wrong was the drawn out, uninteresting action scenes. At the start there is a fight with a huge demon in a dimensional rift, followed soon after by a fight with a giant octopus summoned from the multiverse to new York city that goes on way too long and could be cut in half. This movie picks up not long after Wanda vision, which was a show I really liked. Sadly, it just uses that as a basis to build the plot off of and doesn't really have any of the flair Wanda vision had and not anything like the town of Westview or Vision are mentioned much, if at all.

","This is another level of movie scripting and perfect story telling.. Marvel has well and truly embraced the realm of psychological turmoil and mind-bending narratives, first by conjuring up the infinite possibilities of the multiverse in ""Spiderman: No Way Home (2021)"" and then following up with this mega flick as one of the best ever..👌in a uni Avenger story. The cinematography, CGI, music, visuals,psychadelic effects and the unusual elements of horror and surprise add to the flummoxing experience. The movie has a ton of past references from the MCU,Fantastic 4, Disney and also the comics,and one could understand and enjoy those references only if they are familiar with the past timeline and have read a handful of comics. The direction of the movie is exactly what made it very unique. Benedict was as usual stylish and precise in his performance.. surprise package is the wide spectrum for Wanda... Lisa is muti-equipped across emotions. Movies. The character of America Chavez has also been brought into limelight in this movie,although according to me the plot made the character develop very randomly and the film. ( om personal opinion, this character should have been named India... as this is going to be the next big char from Mcu. ) When I saw the first part,I was baffled. I feel that I share a great emotional connect and resemblance with the character of Stephen Strange myself. Overall does leave you with mixed emotions of confusion,excitement,astonishment,grief but trust me it would be worth of a watch. We three me, wife and my 12 yr son thoroughly njoyed the trip..😎 The movie is dark,trippy,surprising,and bewildering.

2740,13 November 2022,basementbrotherscollectibles,4," Live Olsen, Strange Magic, and Raimi moments, not much else
","Okay, so the only reason I didn't give this film a 1/10 is bc of my love for Doctor Strange from the comics, ""Raimi moments"" in movies, and Liz Olsen as an actress. So consider this a biased review. I respect your opinion if you hated this film. It's still more rewatchable for me than Black Widow, Shang Chi, Eternals, Thor: Love and Thunder, and the lameness on Disney+. It was a huge disappointment coming off Spider-Man: No Way Home. However, I enjoyed seeing just the weird and goofy Dr. Strange scenes and action on the big screen again. At times, it brought me back to the trippy comics. That in no way makes this a good film. In fact, this is not a good film objectively. But, I liked parts of it. I wasn't bored like I was during Shang Chi and Eternals. Liz Olsen is a good actress and carries (""Carrie's"") her scenes, even if it doesn't always make sense why she does what she does. The morality and motives of characters in this film is typical broken, evil Hollywood-they don't know what makes a person a hero these days...or at least refuse to tell such stories. Nowadays, every villain is justified or sympathetic whereas the heroes are problematic and privileged. Stupid. Liz Olsen also looks wonderful. I love her costume. Beautiful! Benedict Cumberbatch is in a similar situation as Liz Olsen-good acting but odd choices from writing and directing aspect for his character. America Chavez is really bad in multiple ways, and I feel sorry for that actress. She took a job, and hopefully it doesn't hamstring her career. The other characters, including Wong, were wasted in this film. Only Liz and Benedict were the reason I kept watching. Wong would've been a reason to keep watching, but he's another sidelined male (same with Baron Mordo). They don't have character arcs and just appear for a Marvel joke moment or to thread along the unreavelling plot. The script, dialogue, and especially the plot/world building of this film is extremely weak, full of holes and inconsistencies, and breaks so much previously established in the MCU. As an MCU film and in regards to its continuity, I only think LoKi has broken the in-universe continuity more, so it's very destructive in that aspect. The other horrific thing to see is Wanda murdering the Illuminati, especially Mr. Fantastic. I hated that part. I guess it was shocking? Not worth the trade off though-kill off beloved characters for shock value...That was an awful choice and a backhanded ""fan-service"" moment. Thanks, Marvel, for hating your audience again. The creepy weird Raimi scenes-like Liz Olsen creeping like Linda Blair in the Exorcist from a portal, her chasing down the heroes in a tunnel, ripping apart doorways sealing off exit/entry points, like a psycho babysitter, mother-gone-mad, or Carrie film, and the Zombie Doctor Strange-all made me smile and felt very Raimi-esque. It's also always good to see Bruce Campbell, especially punching himself in the face. With that all said, the Multiverse was hardly there or made sense, it was full of madness in mostly bad but a few good ways, and it was incredibly...Strange. I want to like it, but I think it's best considered as one of those films where you either watch a few select clips or have it on in the background while you do something else. Of course, you could just watch Phases 1-3 instead if you're going to go that route, and you'd be better off.

","I personally quite enjoyed the movie, however on the whole it felt a bit rushed and could have benefitted with slightly more grounded character story telling. The action scenes are great and visually it is captivating but It feels like the movie was in such a rush to tell the story that it brushed over its own main characters, most notably Chavez, her acting was solid but it felt like she was more there as a plot device as supposed to a genuine character. The horror elements are great and the movie has clear traces of Raimi , I particularly enjoyed the horror elements. However Strange was massively nerfed in his own second outing and Wanda massively over powered which is so inconsistent of Marvel. The cameos ( while I enjoyed them ) were purely done for cameos sake and to get a reaction out of crowds. In the end it felt like the movie was trying to combine a lot together and it felt a little messy and the Wanda plot felt a little weak and felt like Dr Strange was slightly sidelined at times in his own movie. Although the movie was solid and the acting was fantastic, it felt like a step down following up from NWH and feels a lot more forgettable than Strange 1.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

The movie, in my opinion, felt like an excuse to kill Wanda/The Scarlett Witch just after they introduced her new powers and motivations for the future. The film definetly included some satisfying fights and a showcase of the two powerful characters's abilities, but ultimately wastes the viewer's time. If you were able to cut out the useless dialogue and boring scenes the movie would've had a runtime of 45 minutes. After killing off Wanda, it was teased that she survived after all. Which makes the movie a 3 hour long introduction to a new character, who only got around 20 minutes of screen-time anyway.

","Heading into Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, it's fair to say fans had a lot of lofty expectations. Unfortunately, many of those didn't become a reality, potentially explaining why many feel disappointed by the blockbuster. We obviously got some high-profile cameos, but, like Eternals, the Doctor Strange sequel failed to add mutants to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Wanda Maximoff has a lot of history with mutants in the comic books, of course, and even removed the powers of millions of them during the House of M storyline. With that in mind, you'd think there might be a way for the Scarlet Witch to bring them into the MCU, and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness writer Michael Waldron explained why that didn't happen while talking to ET Online. Yeah, we talked about House of M, and there's plenty of examples of Wanda doing bad things throughout the comics in an effort to get her kids back,"" he explained. ""But ultimately this story didn't need mutants to be powerful, I guess was our feeling. And, you know, wherever that lies on the timeline for the MCU, it didn't feel like this was the right place to introduce it. Then it suddenly would have just been about mutants, Waldron continued.

This surprised me as his spiderman movies were good superhero movies but you can really tell this movie is made by the guy who made evil dead. I don't hate evil dead i just don't think the style matches up with the first doctor strange. I understand these big style changes have worked well in the past (specifically referring to thor ragnarok when compared to thor and thor the dark world) but you really have to know what you're doing to pull something like that off. My only real criticism of this movie is that it's cannon with Wandavision (personally haven't seen but some quick googling allowed me to fill in the blanks) and this essentially means that they are just restricting their audience which i feel isnt great.,/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

The story itself is so boring and the main antagonists reasons for being the antagonist are genuinely laughable, it's that stupid. I'm not a big fan of the MCU admittedly but 'Dr Strange (2016)' was one of the few I enjoyed the most and it's a shame the sequel failed to live up to it whatsoever. The main reason I was exited for 'Dr Strange and the Multiverse of Madness' was cameos from characters that haven't been introduced yet or have been introduced in previous franchises however these cameos feel so pointless and for the sake of getting peoples attention which 'Marvel Studios' clearly saw as a cash grab after the success of 'Spider-Man: No way home'. It's funny to be saying that the cameos were what I was looking forward to the most yet now I've seen the movie I'm genuinely disappointed with them.

I personally haven't delved into evil dead as of right now, but I'm glad that fans are getting what probably seemed like a dream to many. I thought the movie did a good job keeping up the tension throughout the movie but it never really, at least for me got to the point of flat out scary. The biggest issue for me regarding multiverse of madness was the way that it treated Wanda. I know she has kinda been known to be a bad guy in the comics, but the last time we saw her in the movies she let go of westveiw and her children for the better good. I felt like it was a bit of a slap in the face to her character progression. That being said they were able to have a lot of fun with her as the villain and I appreciated that.

2935,8 May 2022,HenRex,5," Thoroughly disappointed with the discontinuity
","The director of Dr. Strange 2 openly admits he did not even watch WandaVision. That really goes to show in the movie we got. I was disappointed from quite early on in the movie once we learned who the villain of the movie is. I mean, even the trailers for this movie misrepresents what the movie is about. I have watched Daredevil and the other Marvel-Netflix series, and I was always disappointed that they were a complete waste of time as there was never any tie-in with the wider MCU other than the occasional honorable mention. With WandaVision, Loki and What If? I finally got the feeling that Disney was going to fix this disjointedness. Alas this movie clearly goes to show that those series were a complete waste of time. From the early onset the movie completely ignores what happened in WandaVision and repeats the same story over again, and does a bad job at retelling it. This time around the plot device is very shallow. It never goes beyond Wanda's basic, maternal instinct. I found myself bored in the cinema, actually, with yet another shallow Marvel story that relies too much on CGI. It basically is a bad retelling of WandaVision. Additionally, the movie does not know the story it wants to tell: The word ""multiverse"" is in the title, but the movie in actuality does little to no exploring of said multiverse. It does give us a quick snapshot of a number of dimensions, but no exploration happens. And that is a shame since actively engaging the multidimensionness as a plot device like in What If? Would have been entertaining to watch. As in, I would have liked to know if there was some large, hidden secret with the mirror dimension? Or the astral dimension? I actually expected there to be a huge tie-in with the Loki Series on Disney+, but alas instead we get a movie that tries to do too much in too little time. We get zombies, weird space starfish monsters like if it were a Suicide Squad replica. We get a disjointed story and an odd cameo from those other franchises that Disney now own. In conclusion, I am afraid that the MCU will become yet another X-Men disaster. What basically killed the X-Men as a serious franchise was the lack of cohesion between movies and its blatant disregard of continuity. Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is exactly this: A disaster of continuity for anyone having watched the Disney+ series leading up to this movie release. But at least now Marvel can just make up the cheap excuse for every continuity error that happens in future: ""The story takes place in another dimension"". And that is what this movie basically is. It's nothing but a strategic move from Disney to make more movies that do not necessarily relate to one another, because they now introduced the multiverse concept.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

","Oh, wow! This film is truly a masterpiece, isn't it? I mean, it's just so captivating and thrilling! The confusion and boredom it brings are simply delightful. As a die-hard Doctor Strange fan, I couldn't ask for anything better than this second installment, which is nothing short of a failure in terms of its ambiguous and inconsistent villain. And let's not forget the genius decision to have our protagonist magically possess knowledge of a cursed book without any logical explanation. It's like watching an Evil Dead wannabe with poorly executed jump scares. Sure, the emotional turmoil of Strange tugged at my heartstrings initially, but as the movie progressed, it devolved into a chaotic mess. The Multiverse concept was nothing more than a recycled version of the first film. Oh, how I longed for something more! And don't even get me started on the inconsistent CGI. Some parts were commendable, while others resembled a pile of garbage. It's as if I stumbled upon a bizarre amalgamation of a birthday party and a Halloween opera. America Chaves as Scooby-Doo, Scarlet Witch as a senile witch, and Strange... well, I have no idea why he lacked any shine or charisma. Oh, the comedy in this film was perfectly balanced, never excessive. But let's not forget that one eye-rolling moment that felt like a cheap dumpster fire. Sam Raimi's habit of delivering subpar visuals and his nonchalant attitude towards perfectionism truly shone through. His obsession with horror is truly mind-boggling. And let's not forget the abysmal and convoluted screenplay. Even children found themselves bored to tears by this film. Oh, it's definitely a nail-biting experience, but executed in all the wrong ways. Such an anticlimactic and tedious mess! It's too pedestrian and mindless. And oh boy, Scarlet Witch morphing into a comical version of Doctor Octopus... Sam Raimi really didn't need to revisit his old bag of tricks. He already did that in two Spider-Man films, and only the first one was executed somewhat decently. The question of whether Wanda is alive or dead truly kept me on the edge of my seat... not! And let's not forget the overflowing brilliance of Phase 4, drowning in excessive budgets and a dearth of creativity. Clearly, what they needed was more runtime to enhance the quality. But hey, who needs that when we can have a laser focus on Wanda? I mean, why make sense of it all? Why have Wanda be anything but a valiant warrior? There are so many other interesting characters to explore, right? This premature decision is undoubtedly a testament to their lack of trust in the audience's intelligence. Oh, and let's not forget how Disney conveniently butchered some of the scenes. That's just their greediness toward the family-friendly image shining through. The eerie and tacky atmosphere in this film is a result of their obsession with minimizing runtime. It's truly their sinful indulgence. Oh, what a generous gift to the MCU!

So much potential squandered. They even kill off (potentially) Wanda in one of the last scenes, and there was no reaction from myself or others, just boredom. Such a shame...

","Go into this movie with low expectations. I am personally a hard person to disappoint. But after seeing this I was disappointed. I love marvel and doctor strange is easily in my top five favorite super hero's. I feel that this move felt slightly rushed and the plot was nonexistent. The characters were stale and two dimensional. The trailer pretty much gives you 85% of what happens. Leaving only one maybe two surprises I wasn't impressed with. It was jam packed with action and a few attempts of horror. When watching this I had last Jedi vibes. What I mean is it feels like a lot happens that does not progress the movie nor does it develop any of the characters. I think marvel/Disney really dropped the ball with this one. For a movie called ""multiverse"" of madness there was not much multiverse going on. I feel as if they a lot of missed opportunities when it came to cameos and multiverse traveling. What if..? Series does it better. Elizabeth Olsen steals the show for sure and does an amazing job portraying the character. Honestly should have been called scarlet witch and the multiverse of madness. I guess Disney wasn't ready or willing to do that. Overall this movie fell flat and was watered down. Although Elizabeth Olsen does wonderful I fell her character did not develop with the story and goes in a circle. As for other characters I wish I could say the same but most are not important have no meaning to the MCU or the story. If they were going to do a ""multiverse"" movie they should have overloaded on cameos and I would have been fine with them having no meaning.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

That said, I feel that the newest Marvel movie has left something to be desired. The romance and emotional moments in the movie were cheesy, the humor was poor in the rare places where it existed, and at some points the graphics were so violent and gory that I forgot that I was watching a Marvel movie. On top of this, I feel like the movie doesn't do Wanda's character justice. I know that quite a few members of my family adore Wanda, and they are going to be utterly disappointed and shocked by her character in this movie. I also feel that a better title for this movie would be Multiverse of Ridiculousness, due to the fact that halfway through the movie, we are greeted for our ticket price by the Illuminati!!

It was her story from the start doctor strange was just there to stop her. The story felt crammed they should have kept it a close to a 3 hour movie. You jump into the action right away it doesn't stop for a breath. The introduction of America Chavez needs more padding how are we to have a connection with a new character just thrown in from the start. I felt more a connection with the illuminati than with her. Maybe a limited series of her own would have solved this? Also the title definitely misleads us. Multiverse of madness, I'm expecting multiverse madness not short visits to 3 or 4 universes. Loki was more of a multiverse of madness than this. With the negatives out of the way. This movie was still entertaining and creepy as hell which I liked. It's definitely unique in the marvel universe and opens the possibilities for more crazy stories in the future. Wanda was amazing she is the strongest hero and they let you know that. I'm mean just murdering the illuminati in 2 seconds was great and unexpected. It was also great to see professor x, captain carter, and mr fantastic in a universe coexisting. I hope they make other movies with these characters especially with John krasinski as mr fantastic. He's perfect for that role. Now dead in that universe but so what.

They made scarlet which's kids so much like kids that it seems fake. The teenager girl (America) is also too.. teenagery in the way she behaves. I know teenagers behave like teenagers but she's like all teenagers and no real uniqueness. They tried some jokes but compared to other Marvel movies, it's not that funny.

The visualization itself deserves a watch in the big screen. It's something to behold and admire. The simplicity in which they introduced and explained the complicated concept of the multiverse and it's possible implications was highly commendable. Finally, they successfully play with a different genre and finally break out of the formulaic approach they used for dissapointments like Black Widow, Shang Chi, and the Eternals. This really is a must watch film but don't go into it thinking oh I want to see a certain cameo do this or that. No way home has ruined marvel fans in the sense that they expect cameos or nostalgia to be greater than the scene or the overarching plot of the film.

","If you're going to call something multiverse of ""madness"" it needs to contain madness. This movie should have been at least 30 minutes longer and had an R rating, you could see that they cut stuff out and the gore they kept should have had more to it. It was lacking a lot in both visual effects, script and character development. America stood around for half the movie then suddenly was like ""oh I can control my powers now"" and her backstory was barely explained. Wanda's motive is so stupid and how in EVERY universe did she end up with kids? It does not make sense. I did enjoy seeing Christine more but we still didn't get a lot of Wong. The visual effects were really bad in several places, especially Zombie Strange and the roof in the city. Additionally, the dialogue felt inappropriate and out of place in several spots including the ""I can do this all day"" and ""go back to hell"". I liked the Illuminati members but they made stupid character choices and their purpose was not really explained. I was expecting more cameos when they fell through the multiverse in the beginning. One scene I did really enjoy is the one with all the music notes. It was very cool to experience as someone who likes movie scores and it fit the scene very well. I felt that it was missing plot and had a lot of unexplained points, we were along for the ride and not the lore. If you're going to give me a multiverse I want to see a multiverse and I want it to look good. This movie was advertised as something that was going to be insane and gory and interesting but it was half baked and had too short a run time.

Which is why this movie was amazing!!! Not only did it intrigue me to actually watch the missing 25%, but it gave just enough to not leave me entirely in the dark about it. The fact that it includes characters in the Marvel Universe, and attaches them all like the spider-verse was really fascinating. Not only that, but almost nods to other movie universes, like Stephen King and of course Sam Raimi. Carrie, The Mist, and The Dark Tower references can be noticed on the 1st viewing.

Visuals were some of the best of the MCU, definitely somewhere in the top 10. Music is also some of the best the MCU. Lizzie Olsen stole this movie with her killer performance. Yes, Wanda's ""villain""arc is controversial, but this arc further develops her as a character from WandaVision, and this arc more looked at once she gets an redemption arc sooner or later. Cumberbatch also gives another strong performance, and Strange's morale of getting over his past in the last 5 years further develops his character which I think is underrated.

The Scarlet witch was on her full potential but Doctor Strange wasn't & I was highly expecting him to see him on his full potential in this movie + Marvel already spoiled the whole movie in their trailers specially important scenes like Scarlet witch meeting her variant in the end of the movie , defender strange Turing the DreamWalk spirits as his power & many more , there were literally no place in the movie which we hadn't seen before , we can already tell where the character is going , cuz we have already saw it the trailers & there was no action scene which we haven't seen already in trailers , the T. V spot trailers spoiled the most + they kept posting more footage of the movie on their social media accs , which I was able to avoid but still the main trailer itself was literally a summary of all the important scenes of the whole movie combined .The movie was genuinely great but it could've been greater!!",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

","Dr strange is one of my favorite characters in the MCU, so I was mad that this film didn't do him justice. The plot is kinda like Kung Fu Panda 3, but very disjointed and strung together with random items and abilities to make things work out, which feels very contrived. There are lots of weird moments in dramatic sequences where the pacing is off, which messed up my immersion. I didn't like America Chavez's character, just bad acting up against Cumberbatch and I was left wanting more of characters that barely got any screen time. As far as effects go though it was pretty cool, but yikes on any substantive stuff Marvel.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

The most exciting bit of the movie should have been the idea of the multiverse and the wonders within it, and instead it sort of became an afterthought, used merely to allow the movie to flow.

That said, this movie wasn't really about Doctor Strange at all, in fact, I'd say it would have been more accurately titled ""Scarlet Witch and the Council of Woke."" Sadly, what this film does well, even among the few evident CGI bombs, is far overshadowed by undertones and diluted story. Perhaps Marvel needs to reevaluate their writing and producing before labeling a film. Don't get me wrong, visually, it was almost perfect, almost. However, it's sheer lack of cohesiveness makes it unbearable most of the film. Benedict Cumberbatch should've, in my opinion, been the shining star in this film, and they chose to make the entire movie about ""Wandavision."" I fear this is the new norm that Marvel has settled into, or perhaps they just gave up.

I can't understand it, that is the most unfirm demon I've ever seen.

","Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is already the 28th entry to the MCU franchise and still Marvel continues to deliver new and exciting experiences to the fandom. What can only considered an entry in the horror genre, Multiverse of Madness succeeded on all fronts with its crazy and bizarre out of this universe premise. The film did not shy away in its weirdness as it expanded on the concept of multiverses originally introduced in WandaVision, Loki, What If?, and the latest Spiderman film, No Way Home. Helmed by the one and only Sam Raimi (known for directing the original Spiderman trilogy, and the Evil Dead series), he masterfully crafted a unique and visually stunning experience. If you are a fan of Raimi like me, you will be surely be delighted as this film is filled with his signature flashy and dynamic direction (and his brand of humor). Being a master of horror-comedy, it is in full display here and I relish every second of it. Being a PG 13 movie, he might have made some compromises here but some scenes are borderline Rated R for depictions of gore and shock and I loved it. Once again, Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Strange is as charismatic as ever and continued to be impressive in this role. It is also worth noting the strong performance of Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff (Scarlet Witch) which greatly added to the emotional weight of the story. As expected from MCU, the cinematography is breathtaking with visuals that are reminiscent of the colorful panels of comic books. The music is also worth mentioning as it added another tool for storytelling, and Danny Elfman did a wonderful job in scoring every scene. My only complaint is that there is some pacing issues near the beginning as the film tries to explain the concept of multiverses.

","I always read reviews on IMDB before watching movies and thankfully I have avoided some stinkers thanks to you guys. However as this is a AAA from a AAA franchise I will always watch it. So this is my first review on IMDB in hoping to contribute to the community. The movie starts off really fun. Introducing some characters that we know with a bit of humour but it quickly goes down hill. In the last AAA Marvel movie Spideman: No Way Home we were introduced to some old friends that because of a tear in the Multiverse they were allowed to enter. This set the precedent for this movie, a chance to introduce characters we know and love that have since been from studios that have been consumed by Disney but we get nothing. Charles Xavier was teased in the trailer to get us excited about the X-Men and it leads to nothing along with John Krasinski as Reed Richard's. It's an incredibly lazy effort from Raimi and brings nothing to the future of the franchise except the introduction of another an annoying teenager. Wanda Maximoff is almost comical in her delivery as a villain, using the same old tired tropes we have seen before. We don't see the multiverse it's basically 2 and 1 of them is briefly touched upon. As we have all sat through hours of the MCU mini series' waiting for something to happen nobody from any them appears except Wanda. I love the MCU but this entry makes me worried about their future.

The reason is simple...every film up untill Avengers infinity war...was treated as a single film....which only got connected to the previous films and forth coming films in the end credits.....
Another very important reason is that they were always successful in blending relatable plot points.... emotional journeys of the characters..and the superhero marvel comicbook stuff....
And the best example for that is CAPTAIN AMERICA CIVIL WAR....that movie is actually the best in the entire MCU because it catered to fans of comicbooks....and also kept the realism in the movie....(the real part was governments interfering and imposing the will that Avengers should work for them and take permissions....)",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

And Elizabeth Olsen is an absolute goddess her acting and perfect voice matching is a thing to cherish.

","I'm sure the direction taken for the fate of Wanda Maximoff after her time in West View will be divisive, and a lot of fans were eager to see her take a turn as a villain. Unfortunately, WandaVision did not set her up as a villain, rather a tragic hero who recognized her mistakes, learned from them, and was willing to atone for them. While this version of the Scarlet Witch was a sympathetic character, it simply wasn't the same Wanda we saw at the end of WandaVision. Her actions completely invalidate her moral victory over Agatha Harkness and her ultimate decision to let go of Vision and her new family when she realized she was hurting people. What was once a very complex hero quickly turned into a rather generic, one-note MCU villain with a very black and white agenda. Her certainty towards achieving her goal seemed very out of place and disconnected to how she has behaved in past movies, and her ultimate sacrifice at the end did not adequately atone for her callous, murderous rampage.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

The appearance of the Illuminati was so underwhelming. Another issue I had is that after showing us that Wanda was a cold-blooded murderer throughout the entire, they'll probably just have her in future projects trying to redeem herself and become a better person.

I admit, there was one scene where the cape gets up and starts punching Strange in the face to wake him up, this was the funniest thing I had seen the whole movie. I laughed out loud in the cinema, the laughing quickly turned to screaming. I couldn't breathe, it was so funny. I even peed a little!

My experiance trying to watch this movie and get through that bit was quite hard and did contribute to my one star review but nonetheless, this severe lack of REAL cape jokes was a problem for me.

3925,4 July 2022,sbcashin,7," 7.3/10, disappointing given the possibilities but still not bad
","A decent movie that's fun to watch and has some great action scenes to go with its fair plot. Sam Raimi differed from the traditional Marvel formula, adding his own flair, which I found to have pros and cons of its own. Despite some cool cameos, a lot of things relating to them didn't make sense in terms of the general universe. On top of that, a good number of plot points don't work well and a few dialogues which are beyond unrealistic given context. One of the things that I latched onto and see as problematic despite being mostly inconsequential (and possibly easily explained) is Earth-838, the universe of the Illuminati, a version of Wanda, and Ultron bots. While this universe is definitely different from the main MCU universe (whether that is Earth-616 or Earth-199999), I find that the existence of Wanda's children and the Ultron bots to be curious. Wanda's story in the main universe is that she became radicalized against Tony Stark after his company's bombs were used to terrorize her hometown. She joined Hydra, and later joined Ultron. Ultron was also created by Tony Stark in the main universe, and his existence prompted the creation of Vision, who would 'father' Wanda's children. For one, I'm nearly certain Tony Stark's existence in Earth-838 was never confirmed, though I could be wrong, or a simple mention of his name would debunk this problem. The other issue I found is the existence of the Ultron bots and how that would mean Vision's existence and thus Wanda's children's existence is dubious. Whether it was Mr. Fantastic or Tony Stark who created Ultron in Earth-838, Vision was made by the rogue Ultron in Earth-838 as an upgraded body for Ultron. If Ultron was created and his purpose was met without going rogue (aka the Ultron bots, as shown in Earth-838 and Tony's intention in the main universe), then Vision wouldn't've been created, and thus Wanda wouldn't've met Vision and Billy and Tommy wouldn't've been born. My words might not make complete sense, but I'm nearly certain neither does Billy and Tommy's existence does either. To connect with another thing, Wanda teamed up with a rogue Ultron because she was mad at Tony Stark. If rogue Ultron never existed, then it would make sense that Wanda (Earth-838) wouldn't be in effectively the same place that she was in the main universe, aside from the Scarlett Witch stuff. Simplified, Tony Stark creates a rogue Ultron who created Vision, who partnered with Wanda, made Vision, who together were the 'parents' of Billy and Tommy (in the hex). Earth-838 has no Tony Stark, no rogue Ultron, no rogue Ultron team up with Wanda, no Vision, no Wanda and Vision falling in love, and yet ends up with a content Wanda, a missing Vision, Billy and Tommy existing, and me losing my mind over nothing. This is on top of the glaringly obvious issues that have been heavily talked about, memed, and other things, like Mr. Fantastic, the ""smartest man"" in the world, telling Wanda his whole plan of how to fight her with Black Bolt, as well as Dr. Strange, Wanda, and America Chavez not stopping to talk for three minutes about the possibility of teaching America to use her powers and send Wanda to a universe where Billy and Tommy exist and Wanda is dead or not in the picture. This also goes for just how Wanda could have simply found America peacefully and tried to help her figure out her powers to find her moms and a universe with Billy and Tommy without Dr. Strange altogether. Also, Wanda dying at the end is a complete waste of her character and the possibilities it brings, though I know it is probably not her actually dying, despite being crushed by an immeasurably big structure of pure stone. I'm sure she'll be back, whether it be from the dead because she's needed or from another universe, depending on how the X-Men and mutants are introduced. Anyway, I felt like ranting about small mistakes of a plot of a movie that a multi-billion-dollar corporation wanted to cash in on. It's easy to talk about problems and hard to verbally appreciate a complete plot. I had a fun time watching the movie, and I would probably recommend it, though maybe not to someone who picks apart small things like I might. I give a 7.3/10.",/review/rw8280587/?ref_=tt_urv,Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_2022

If they're showing us these characters in the trailers, they must have bigger surprises in store!"" I know it was almost impossible to live up to the hype, but still... for a company that basically reinvented, and monopolized the ""cinematic universe"" to do a Marvel Multi-verse movie, this seems like a wasted opportunity to me. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved it! But they had such a great chance to deliver so much more than what we got. With a multi-versal movie like this, we could have gotten so many more characters (old, new, and even one-offs) without the expectation of seeing them again. I really wanted to see a fight ala Ultron vs The Watcher in What If..? Where they're just crashing through universes, falling into quick battle shots of other characters.
