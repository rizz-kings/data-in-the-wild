","Shang-Chi gave me hope for Phase 4 of Marvel. Eternals dashed those hopes. This is probably my least favorite Marvel movie. This film is too long and crammed full of overly complicated plot points, yet it's also completely predictable. It seems the filmmakers were too busy trying to check off boxes rather than create a good story. It's also a downer. People watch MCU movies to have fun, not to have existential crises.

","I'm not going to give a long winded review though the movie was long. ""Eternal"" was the runtime. There were parts that were good and parts that weren't. One of the biggest issues is that a movie of this nature presents more questions than it answers. The very existence of eternal beings existing on planet Earth, sent there by their creator in order to protect human life from Deviants, begs a lot of questions. And the more they strayed from their prime directive, the more questions they presented. The eternals were human in every aspect with the exception of their powers and their lifespan. The fact that such humanlike and very fallible beings (as in not entirely obedient) were sent to protect humans is just a start of the questions.",/review/rw7557567/?ref_=tt_urv,Eternals_2021

","Ok but how are they speaking english since they are before the time when english language was spoken? I was extremely disappointed with this movie. The amount of plot holes and wasted potential was really annoying and Sersei had 0 personality. The visuals were amazing but it doesn't make up for the lack of logic put into the movie. The powers were so inconsistent and the prime eternal was just wasted after not even putting up a fight. The deviants were wasted as well and the celestials not telling the eternals why they're on the planet made no sense. Just so many reasons to dislike the execution of the movie. This was a lame movie, there is always a useless hero in every show and Thena was this movies useless hero... How tf you let your man die right in front of you. Thanos IS a Deviant-Eternal.

They focused all the attention for almost 2 hours on the deviance and all of a sudden it turns out they're not the bad guys after all let's focus 30 minutes of the rest of the movie on someone else.. Marvel failed a great cast with a terrible script. Marvel should separate Eternals film into 2 Parts to have more progressive storyline and deep dive on characterization and the build up of motivation to save the Earth with balanced action sequences and dramas in between... Eternals Book 1 and Eternals Book 2. Just like what Warner did on Dune film.. or Avengers 3 and 4. Worst movie I've seen in years!!!! Worst MCU movie. Hardly any character development, no reason to care about the characters. Outside if him, the comedy was lackluster. Pace was off. Most performances by the actors were good but their stories were not deep enough, hard to do with that many protagonists in one movie. My first thought was why do the people already have british and scottish accent even before they arrive on earth? Like it would make sense if they all spoke similar english when they first arrive on Earth but when they later end up separating and going their own ways they end up developing their british and scottish accent or whatever.

Sure, SOME of it was good, but our main villains, the devil-alien dogs were laughably fake looking and the 1st post-credit scene had this small ""creature"" who was about on par with Super Nintendo graphics. Also, only some of the humor landed, but most felt forced. I did LOVE all the diversity and acting - each actor really tried their best. The plot is okay, but it did drag and shoot, am I tired of hearing excuses when MCU introduces new Super-Human characters who were around for wars, including the Infinity War, and did nothing to help/prevent it.

","Not really sure why this movie got so much hate. It's introducing a swath of new superhero's and doesn't really converge with any other Avengers plot lines save for a few mentions of Thanos, Thor and some other hero's. That job on its own isn't an easy one and I think they did a fantastic job of giving us a new storyline. The shear scale of the movie was well done both in terms of time periods and in general how epic and massive everything felt. Loved the diversity of the characters - every one of them added something to the story. With that being said - and this is coming from just your average Marvel fan with no knowledge of the comics - the Eternals powers all seemed a bit underwhelming. Maybe it's just that they were trying to display how powerful the deviants were but even Ikaris couldn't take down one on his own. Other than that the movie was absolutely beautifully shot - maybe the best looking Marvel movie to date.

So Celestials need to seed intelligent life to birth their kind but stood by somehow as Thanos wiped out half of life, then came back to completely wipe out the other half and all of existence? I really want to like this movie but it just didn't really work for me. Really feel like this needed to be a miniseries or spread out across multiple movies. Just too much stuff crammed into a 2 hour period. Didn't give me enough time to care about the characters/story that much, and the wonky pacing and acting didn't help with that either.

Humor was very weak; the best lines were from the trailer and most of those were cringey. Kit Harrington was wasted. Angelina Jolie was wasted. All the major plot points were just exposition vomit or were so obviously telegraphed. I was never so conflicted in a post-credit scene. On one hand I was grateful for this dreadful movie to be over, and then sacked with absolute apathy that the Eternals ""will return...."" I hope not.

","Okay, bear with me since this will be a difficult review. I don't particularly think this was ruined by too many characters as Endgame had 31+ characters, but suffered from poor pacing, runtime, and the lack of character development. I have to say that I did not enjoy this film as I am not into mythology stuff. The first and second acts were painfully boring with a bit decent third act. Ajak was given nothing to her character. Sersi. I almost have no idea what to say about her, but her personality should have been interesting. For Ikaris, I was not interested in the romance between him and Sersi. The sex scene wasn't needed at all, although I am surprised that have gotten away from that in a PG-13 movie. He does have a few fun scenes where he speculates a table to be made out of vibranium, slams it which turned out it isn't. ""I don't wear a cape."" Kingo was a decent and fun character that I mostly enjoyed throughout the movie. He had an interesting character setting where he has a fondness for movies and modern technology as he is a famous Bollywood movie star, dancer, and director who has fun with humans. Karun was also a fun presence with great chemistry with Kingo. The stuff about him and filming a documentary was hilarious. For Sprite. Oh my god. I think she has to be my least favorite character in this movie, there isn't anything interesting about her, and she always whines. Phastos was not bad, but a decent character. I have to say that the 1945 scene was mentally heartbreaking commenting on how advancing technology can have brutal consequences. Druig. I do have big mixed feelings about him. He does somewhat have a character arc where he doesn't want the humans to have a conflict so he uses his powers to stop them, but is stopped by the group. Eventually, in the third act, he learns to not interfere with conflicts, but still, I don't like him either way. Makkari wasn't annoying like the others as she has a likable personality, lack of ability to speak. She's fun and has a great dynamic with the team. Also, I liked how they treated her speed ability. Thena does actually have somewhat of an interesting character arc where she can have episodes that make her go rogue against the team which leads her to go with Gilgamesh in order to make anything to not go worse. The scenes of her fighting with her weapons are quite entertaining. Overall, this is just meh.",/review/rw7557567/?ref_=tt_urv,Eternals_2021

This film claims to be more diverse than the rest of the canon, but it's more of the same action-then-punchline stuff some weary viewers just can't shake off any longer.

","The fact that 'Eternals (2021)' doesn't feel like a Marvel movie isn't an inherently good or bad thing. To me, it feels more distinct than most of the studio's other fare, but it isn't as entertaining. As a whole, the thing just feels a bit flat. It's messy, overly portentous and filled with some pretty baffling choices. Chief among these is the decision to have one of its characters straight-up disappear from the finale for no real reason, only to rear his head again just before the piece comes to a close. The ending (which includes two post-credits stings) is incredibly disappointing, evoking the exact opposite of its intended effect. There are plenty of other plot problems, too. They pale in comparison to the fact that most of the movie just feels fairly lifeless, though. It's pretty dull, to be honest. That being said, it does have its merits. Firstly, the cast are all really good despite the fact that they don't have much to work with. Ma Dong-Seok (here credited as Don Lee) is the obvious highlight, though he's criminally underused. Secondly, there are a handful of scenes which start to properly explore the interesting concepts inherent to the heroes' long-lasting lifespans. Unsurprisingly, the best of these involve actual conflict between the core characters and portray each player's different outlook on their unique situation. Sadly, most characters lack chemistry with one another and often seem isolated from the other people that share the frame with them. They aren't allowed to properly come to life, which is one of the biggest reasons that the piece just isn't all that compelling; we have nobody to care about. This also means that the movie feels as though it lacks real stakes, even though it's literally the entire Earth that's in danger. Without a character to latch onto, we simply don't give a second thought to the humans our heroes are trying to save. However, the feature is visually pleasing overall. The cinematography is suitably 'epic' and the various locations are presented with bold colours and distinct architecture. There are also a couple of entertaining, if slightly intangible, action sequences. The best of these, which is also the best portion of the entire affair, is a mid-point battle set in a remote village. For the most part, though, even the set-pieces fall short of the mark. Overall, this is a pretty disappointing film. It has a strange structure, a sloppy story and generally just feels a bit off. It's far too long, yet somehow not long enough; it would've been much better served as a mini-series. It has its moments, but it just isn't all that good. 5/10.",/review/rw7557567/?ref_=tt_urv,Eternals_2021

Even each Eternal's superpower was lame, and confusing what exactly they can do (except Madden with his X-Men eye power). The one girl was a deaf Flash? It took four to five writers to come up with this slow-paced 156 min Eternally long and boring nonsense? What a waste of a budget. It's a 6/10 from me.

This film is painfully slow and definitely too long, because some storylines take too much screen time. There were basically 7000 years of plot to cover, but the screenplay focuses on some useless story lines, that do not have any kind of impact on the plot. It needs to be heavily cut down. Another thing that I found really annoying is that the movie tells multiple times that ""Eternals"" is part of the MCU, like the audience is composed of a bunch of kids that cannot connect the dots. Disney has been building this narrative universe for more than 10 years. People got the fact that every movie or TV show that Marvel Studios releases is part of it, no need to reiterate. There was a lot of potential, but they did not explore these characters enough and by the end of it, I feel like I barely knew them, so I was not attached to any of them. The acting felt really flat, despite having some class A actors such as Angelina Jolie and Richard Madden. They were not at all convincing. I wonder who decided to hire Gemma Chang, because she portrays one of the most important characters, but she is the most unimpressive element of the cast.",/review/rw7557567/?ref_=tt_urv,Eternals_2021

The writing simply isn't good, and the dialogue just doesn't flow. The action scenes are good as usual, but I found myself wanting the scenes in between to just end to get to the next action scene.

If you see the film through the eyes of someone seeking modern-day thematic elements, then this is the movie for you.

201,5 November 2021,jaidanh,6," Eternals could be less complicated if it wasn't part of Marvel
","I can understand why critics are treating Eternals a bit too harshly. Eternals is very different from all the other films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. However, at the same time, it attempts to maintain the basic structure of its other recent films. The critics expected to see a basic Marvel movie, but they did not meet their full expectations. That makes Eternals difficult to please most Marvel fans. However, I can praise the film for a couple of things. The acting is good and I'm proud of Marvel for having diversity in its cast. The film score is gorgeous and doesn't sound like any other Marvel scores. The cinematography is excellent in many shots; however, a few shots in the movie involved using a green screen, and the cinematography didn't blend well with it. Another problem with the film is that most of the characterization is weak. Kit Harington's character is the most pointless of all characters in the film as he only appears for a few minutes at the beginning of the film and isn't seen again until the end. The post-credits scene showcases some information about his character that will be explored at some point in the MCU, but it felt like something that could've been saved for another movie. Despite being the biggest celebrity in the film, Angelina Jolie also didn't get enough screen time or character development. The screenplay is probably the most flawed screenplay of all MCU movies. It has too much exposition; the characters explain too much information instead of letting the movie show. I get that the film needed some explanations since many people are unfamiliar with the Eternals, but it could've been executed much better. There's also a lot of flashbacks in the film, most parts of which serve as filler. While it does help us learn more about the characters, there were still some bits that could've been cut. In fact, most of this film seems like it tried to cram so much about the Eternals into one movie instead of giving it all to us by dividing it into thirds like most Marvel trilogies. If that doesn't make sense to you, imagine for a minute that Marvel never existed, but suddenly a movie called Avengers: Infinity War comes out. That's exactly what Eternals feels like. I know Tony Stark once said, ""Sometimes you gotta run before you can walk,"" but that does not apply to the process of creating a movie franchise. With that said, Eternals is going to be challenging to build a trilogy upon. The end of this film does tease a sequel, but I can picture this planned series going down the path of the Divergent films. In other words, I find it hard to imagine the sequel(s) maintaining its audience. I would like to see the Eternals as a team appear in future Marvel movies, but if we're giving them their own movies, they'll have to take a different direction to stay consistent.",/review/rw7557567/?ref_=tt_urv,Eternals_2021

","The reaction to this movie has been a ""love it"" or ""hate it"" outcry. I think the dividing line of responses is whether or not it fits the Marvel mega-action template and if that is okay or not. Just to deal with that question out of the gate, this does not fit the Marvel cookie cutter. There are a variety of differences. It is diverse in both casting and subject matter. The cast is international, multinational and multi-ethnic. We have our first openly gay superhero. We have our first hero who is deaf. We have our first hero to struggles with their mental health. All artfully and beautifully presented, in my opinion. This is not a single character's origin story. It is 10 characters' origin story spanning over 7,000 years, plus the introduction of 3 distinct and new species: Celestials, Eternals and Deviants. It also acknowledges superheroes from other universes, like the potshots at DC's Superman. There are also some Marvel staple components, humour, brilliant CGI, fight scenes and world weaving. This film is also beautiful, in its casting, cinematography, graphics and music. The story is rich and the immense timeline is artfully woven into small bites. There is also a deeper treatment of relationships and some mature but tasteful scenes. The draw for me was Marvel and the stellar cast, especially Gemma Chan, whose career I've been following for a long time, now (do yourself a favour and binge her filmography). I have to confess that when I left the theatre I wasn't sure how I felt about the movie. Then, I heard Rotten Tomatoes gave it the lowest of all ratings for a Marvel movie (49%) and the critics who saw early releases were brutal. But, I also read the positive reviews by ordinary theatre goers and in writing this, I've decided to give this film an 8 (great) out of 10 and, personally, I look forward to seeing it again. {Superhero Action Adventure}",/review/rw7557567/?ref_=tt_urv,Eternals_2021

The philosophy is the most significant highlight cause each character provides a different perspective in the debate. They may not be fleshed out but have their individual opinion, which is essential to the story and theme, but it fails to connect with anybody. The biggest issue is the antagonist of this film is wholly butchered and irrelevant to the story. They should've made the antagonist connect to the theme more. And some of the hero's powers are significantly undermined. The director had excellent direction with the idea of the movie but had trouble adapting the superhero side of things.

I came away from this feeling like I knew who everyone was, which I did not expect was possible for such a big cast in this genre. The exposition was the subtlest I've seen from Marvel, and the overall plot was complex enough to still be very clear. For once I didn't have to Google anything afterwards (except for the mid & post credits stuff).",/review/rw7557567/?ref_=tt_urv,Eternals_2021
271,3 November 2021,moviematthewh-60783,6," Hit and miss
","Clearly this film is taking a different approach than what we normally see in a MCU film. The themes are much more dark and carry more emotional weight with them. Chloe Zhao's direction while I thought was great in this film and kept to her style, I just don't think it might fit in the MCU thought. It seems out of place almost because of how different this story is delivered. The story was also a bit messy I thought, with the time jumps going back and forward making it confusing to tie loose ends. And it was also a weak story might I add, because I felt that there wasn't much excitement happening in the film, especially during the second act. There wasn't much development with many of the eternals, as it's too hard for a 2 1/2 hour film to develop 10+ characters deep enough for audiences to feel some sort of emotion towards them. Performances and visuals were stunning though, very good looking film on the big screen. Dolby atmos surround sound delivers also adding immersive experience while watching. The action was a bit light I thought, but the scenes we get are again great visually and choreographed well. The final battle was a bit underwhelming I thought also. It would of worked better as a TV series maybe, but then the visual aspects would be under appreciated if seen on a TV and not a giant imax screen. But this film still adds more clues as to what may happen in the future of the MCU.",/review/rw7557567/?ref_=tt_urv,Eternals_2021

","Eternals may be the worst rated MCU film to date, but it is far from terrible. It's a modest attempt at shaking up the old MCU formula that admittedly has gotten stale as of late. It tries to be different, and it succeeds in that respect. Up until the very last minutes of the film, it didn't feel like an MCU movie at all. Which was refreshing, but it felt disconnected with the other MCU films. It tries to do too much. Essentially it's a poor mans Avengers. The story is rushed and since the characters are all new to us, it's hard to connect with them. The film does have good moments. There are fragments of a great movie in Eternals. Ultimately it just didn't quite fit together well enough. That being said it was entertaining enough to warrant a watch in the theater, and it does have large MCU implications. It's final post credit scene was the first one in a long time that got me excited. Overall it's a bottom tier MCU film, which makes it a pretty good superhero movie all things considered.",/review/rw7557567/?ref_=tt_urv,Eternals_2021

It has a depth that is missing in previous Marvel films and every aspect of the film is beautiful. The visuals are stunning, the cast is incredible and the chemistry between the main group of ten is obvious. The storyline is engaging and includes twists and turns that the audience won't see coming. Sure, it isn't as fast-moving as other superhero movies, but there are ten Eternals that need to be introduced enough for the audience to care about them and so that takes some time. However, it never feels boring and it never drags. The entire cast is incredible, but Barry Keoghan as Druig, Lia McHugh as Sprite and Lauren Ridloff as Mikkari deliver standout performances.

","Let's start off by saying that this movie wasn't great, but was good. In marvel standards it failed to bring that sense of coolness we usually get, probably because there was so much going on. But, I liked the movie. Acting, cinematography, casting, cgi, special effects and general plot were all fantastic. It only missed its mark by trying to fit so many new characters into one movie. It was difficult to feel a connection to them because of this. Except for Gemma Chan's character Sersi, whom I immediately took a liking to and could connect with. She was the highlight of the film for me. Everyone saying this is the worst marvel movie isn't being dramatic. This movie was good. In my opinion, better than Thor 1 & 2, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Venom 1 & 2, Captain Marvel and Incredible Hulk. CGI was much better here than in Black Widow. I think the main disconnect for fans was the fact that none of these characters have been shown before. In all the other MCU movies and series there's been at least one appearance from a previously established character. Even in Shang-Chi, Wong had a little appearance, plus some other characters in the post-credit. None of this happened in Eternals.

Somehow though, none of the characters feel like developed characters by the final act and you're left with a movie with no interesting action, adventure, story, and characters. Some of the things they do just makes no sense either, they will just switch up their entire motives for no reason and it makes no sense.

There are so so many variables in the regression of viewing a motion picture that determines the relationship that we all as humans use. For me, well, for me the grading of such things go usually unscathed. For example I had previously seen the first rendition of the suicide squad movie of the DC comics extended universe. Perhaps it was with my youth at the time of the release (17 in 2016), but I did not despise the movie. As so many well respected media sources lambasted the picture on the world wide web, I was sitting, entertained with the movie that was presented to me. But as I grew older, as my legs grew longer, I had come into my own in terms of what I should enjoy in a motion picture. I had crossed the threshold of looking past the attractive people on the screen, the beautiful choreographation of fight scenes, the awe-inspiring colors of lasers blasting people, and began to see movies for what they really are; Stories, movies are stories. And the story that was presented to me in this new rendition of a marvel movie was absolute abhorrence. There is not a single one of these new eternal characters that I thought was a good character. Actually I lied, I liked the flash's female counterpart who was deaf. The reason I liked her was because she never spoke to make me hate her like the rest of the characters.

Unlike the other movies in this universe, here we have a film that has more of a plot, but it can be tedious for some who are already used to other Marvel movies. It can get boring as it requires a lot of attention. The characters, despite being new, have something interesting and the most remarkable thing about this film is that it takes its plot very seriously and even has a cosmology on the part of Los Celestiales and the origin of the Eternals and the Deviants, which I love. It seemed quite fascinating and gives some depth. If I had to mention the diversity in the characters, I really think it's fine. Each of The Eternals is unique in its own way and that gives them a certain originality, although there was more that should have been explored.

","Eternals is a movie full of love that starts out interesting from the beginning, but that's about it. ""Interesting"" is the keyword for the feature, which takes a long time to get emotional (unlike other Marvel Studios films), but impresses audiences in a calmer way by presenting the vast power of each of the group's members. Super heroes with a wonderful CGI that gives beauty to the film. But don't get confused, it would be unfair to say that Eternals is bad for its slower tone, something different from other films in the franchise. The story is intriguing, enigmatic and holds the viewer to the screen, but the fights full of mystical powers and magic take time to get relevance to the plot and, when they do, they don't show all the giant power that the group of Eternals possess. Regardless of how calm the film is, it's impossible to say that it's serious and dark like the DC Extender Universe features, as some critics have pointed out, as it has a few puns and a certain comedic tone, even if it sometimes comes out of the blue. Eternals is a beautiful film and it deals very well with the issue of diversity, especially with Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), an openly gay character, and Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), who is hearing impaired and wonderfully well produced, but can seem calm.

That concern also seemed justified as the film (though beautiful) had a number of slow plodding moments, didn't have the greatest acting performances, and got lost in massive exposition dumps that over-explained every single detail of the plot. Perhaps the most frustrating part is that her style of film-making is totally incongruous to the battle sequences that are clearly handled by a different team (and have probably been in development before Zhao was even hired to work on the movie.)

Everyone had to stand up (giving everyone a shining point), and various myths and legends should be involved to push the plot forward (the plot is in the comics). There are enough reversals in the Wei Universe), and pave the way for the future of the Marvel Universe. The amount of information is huge, and Zhao Ting also took pictures of it very beautifully. So it feels to me that the pace is very fast. It seems that I only watched it for 1 and a half hours in 2 and a half hours. And there are laughs and tears. Unfortunately, the space for the director to play is limited. Marvel may not be the best, but it is likely that Zhao Ting is the worst. Thinking of it, a sentence can be used at the end of the plot ""when given the choice between being right or being kind, choose kind""",/review/rw7557567/?ref_=tt_urv,Eternals_2021

It's a shift towards something else, a different mythos. Chloe Zhao (if you have seen her earlier films) makes a certain kind of cinema. Seeing Eternals it feels she was given a good amount of creative control. The film might feel slow in the 1st half because of the immense world building it has to do with so many characters and myths involved. It still does it reasonably well. It's very unlike a traditional Marvel film with the cheek in tongue humor and a formulaic approach to film making which works incredibly well.

","In the beginning... Eternals is Marvel's biggest swing in years. Marvel's New Superhero Saga Is Visually Splendid But Lacks Standard Values and Pacing. Certainly, The Weakest Marvel Film Recently. Eternals, a part of Marvel's phase four, is a complete new chapter in MCEU's book. Although the film has references given about running in the same time as other Marvel flicks such as 'Infinity War' and 'Endgame', it has eternal backdrop right from 5000 BC. I wonder, if they were really here when Thanos caused mass destruction, why the hell they didn't show up? Oops, Let me go soft from here. Eternals is a whole new Superhero saga which brings you a bunch of unseen caracters and if you have been following Marvel Cinematic Universe since the beginning then this could be a new series to look out for. But wait, can you hold onto your patience for some time? I mean about 160 minutes with 3D glasses beginning to give you a headache? If yes, then go for it. The story written by Ryan Firpo and Kaz Firpo is definitely unique, and full of heart. In 156 minutes, Externals hardly makes you seat through tightly but when it does, it does it fine. That slow pick-up to the main plot was expected because they had to introduce new characters without giving early spoilers. Eternals stars an ensemble cast including Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani, Lia McHugh, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Ridloff, Barry Keoghan, Don Lee, Harish Patel, Kit Harington, Salma Hayek, and Angelina Jolie. Eternals is also Marvel's most diverse film by far, a bar that, while being so low as to be easily stepped over, is still an achievement to note, belated as it is in the studio's decade-plus-long run. Chlo√© Zhao did such an amazing job directing, making the phase 4 of marvel for there fans to love and future generations to see. ""We have loved these people since the day we arrived.

There's way so many characters that the movie doesn't have enough time to flesh out... any of them. At no point do you believe these characters have spent thousands of years together, they lack chemistry. That's due to stale dialogue but also bad writing. A lot of the characters are so bland or absent for a lot of the movie that i literally dont care if the villains win when they fight. Plus it's a marvel movie so the pending doom feels saturday morning cartoonish and inconsequential. The premise of the movie is interesting but its bogged down by two other plots that dont need to be in the movie. The whole plot of the movie revolves around the characters moral struggle with their role as protectors of the earth, but some of the most interesting characters in the movie... dissappear for 70% of the movie. Some of the characters dissapear and theres never an explanation for why they chose to sit out. This movie shoulda stayed on disney +. This movie tries to do too many things at once. It's trying to be an origin story, fit in multiple seperate villains all with separate motivations, the individual stories of EIGHT eternals and tries to make it all a part of the mcu and a story about morality and an action movie. And it doesn't do ANY of those things well. This is an unfocused, badly written movie that doesn't know what it wants to be, let alone how to execute that.

The greats on this were: the eternals are more god like roles with a more sense of responsibility for the whole planet,I felt alot of the messages being conveyed are that humanity exists for a purpose and were aided by extraterrestrial life forms that have been visiting us for thousands of years. This is just a theory but has gained attention in recent times. Secondly it reminds us how pathetic and great humans can be. And that we all have a part to play for the greater good, lastly in principle the storyline demonstrated a viewpoint of how we should not believe we the only intelligent lifeform in the universe together with the influences and interests that has built up humanity.

The only reason it won prizes was due to another great performance from Frances McDormand ...

726,25 November 2021,theredsky,5," Eternals Review
","Is it as bad as the critics are saying? No. Is it a film that breaks the boundaries of a Marvel film? Also no. Eternals is in this weird limbo where there is a lot of stuff I like but for everything I liked, there was something I didn't like. The film's visuals and directing are honestly some of the best in the series. The environments and shots look consistently great. Sometimes there is the awkward visual effect but that's expected at this point in Marvel. The music is pretty good at points but very forgettable at others which sucks because the good pieces are really gold but the bad pieces are really bad. Half of these characters I found interesting (Sersi, Ikaris, Sprite, Gilgamesh, and Druig) while the other half I found to be boring and uninteresting. Chlo√© Zhao is a great director but I'm not a big fan of her writing. I feel the same way about her previous film Nomadland. There is a lot of exposition that can be interesting sometimes when combined with the pretty visuals but also really boring. Sometimes they prioritize the exposition over character work which is one of the reasons I found some of these characters to be uninteresting.

","Eternals: Ever wonder about different groups of Meta-Humans, Demi-Gods etc who inhabit the MCU yet don't seem to impact on each other until it's time for a new film complicating the timeline and Canon? Never mind, just sit back, relax and enjoy the fun. The Eternals are sent to Earth to protect humans against the Deviants, predatory monsters. Arriving in Mesopotamia in 5000 BC they battle the Deviants using killer eye-beams, super strength etc. The locals are a plucky bunch though and menace the Eternals with spears so Druig (Barry Keoghan) has to control their minds, those minds and hearts are soon won with gifts. Throughout history the Eternals battle the monsters, we them in Babylon (complete with hanging gardens) in 575 BC, in Gupta, 400AD. They have a sort of Prime Directive not to interfere in human conflicts and this especially causes problems for Druig when he sees the Conquistadors slaughtering Aztecs in 1521. But they do nudge technological development along with inventions by Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), I'm not saying it's Aliens but... Anyway after a 500 hiatus the Deviants return so the Eternals must assemble once more. I'm always expecting Ikaris (Richard Madden) to say See You Jimmy in his Scottish accent as he headbutts a monster. Thena (Angelina Jolie) forms weapons from cosmic energy but (like a Limerickian) is likely to stab anyone due to her demented state (Mahd Wy'ry).

","Perhaps the Eternals is one of Marvel's most serious movies without all those jokes that get in the way of the story. I really liked the tone of the film and the way the story is told. I found all the characters very interesting with their particularities and especially the creative way in which they use their powers. The film's time of 2h40 is perfect for telling this story and I would find it difficult for any shorter duration to handle it. The whole presentation of the concept of the eternals, deviants and celestials is great and puts a good context in a part of the Marvel universe that we haven't seen before. Amazingly, the Eternals strike me as the most human characters in Marvel today. There's a lot of philosophy and deep thinking behind the conflicting characters' actions that are all morally questionable. The cinematography of the film is beautiful and the dark tone perfectly matches what the story proposes. It feels like an intimate film, produced with intimacy. The post-credits scenes really made me want to watch a sequel, but I find it difficult for the sequel to follow the same tone and level of quality as this Marvel masterpiece. So far I've watched the movie twice in two days in a row and my opinion remains the same. The strong parts are still strong and I find it hard to find any bad parts. I believe these characters are real people living in the world and considering there were so many characters to introduce and so many new concepts in such a short amount of time. This shows the excellent work of directing and writing that was done. Ikaris is basically a Superman or homeland captain who is completely disproportionate when compared to the other powers. I like how he is the soldier fulfilling his mission understanding the need to sacrifice for the greater good. At the same time, Sersi's counterbalance to the morality of sacrificing so many for a Celestial who will give life to so many other planets and beings is incredibly fascinating to watch on screen. Even Harry Styles didn't seem out of tune in this universe and opened up the possibility of several new stories for the future, including other Eternals and Celestials.",/review/rw7557567/?ref_=tt_urv,Eternals_2021

","The movie, in my opinion, was not a slow, unemotional mess. The characters are incredibly fun to watch and their relationships/conflict are what carry the movie. There was only one moment in the film that I felt dragged on a few minutes longer than it needed to, but it immediately picked up again after that. It was diverse, but not in a preachy, political way. The differences in the characters were empowering and actually aided their characters identities. I think this movie is so contested because it doesn't it the marvel formula as well as other movies (so it is jarring to the marvel fans who crave movies like Ant-Man) and it is a blockbuster superhero movie so it deters the art/critic group. If you put labels aside, this is visually beautiful movie about 7,000 year old superheroes confronting the possibility of death. If that sounds appealing to you, I encourage you to ignore what others are saying and see it for yourself. I would like more experimentation like this in big blockbusters in the future. I think this one boils down to a matter of preference. I gave it an 8 because personally, watching it brought me great joy, I loved the characters and themes, and I felt it was above average. I'm curious to see how time will treat this one. I imagine it will be like many of Jack Kirby's post-60's works: maybe a little too high-concept and hard to digest at the time, but worth a go to see the artists vision.

It wasn't awful or terribly negative, etc...etc.. No. This is not true and it's ridiculous. In my opinion, this movie was ok and it had a good start, it's not equal to, or like the other MCU movies. It's pretty different because it's refreshing and its origins are new. People need to understand this. The reason why I say it was ok is because I don't like movies that have stories with flashback scenes. I admit I hate flashback scenes, but it also depends on the story. For example, in the movie Titanic, the movie had flashback scenes there weren't that many. The movie began with an old woman describing her story about her experiences and what happened on the Titanic. Then the flashback scene took us back to when she was young on the Titanic. It's just a one-time flashback and it continued to the end. That's the type of flashback that I like. There are not too many flashbacks, with many characters in the movie, Eternals. It's easy for me to fall asleep and it is boring. But this is just my opinion. Also, the movie is pretty long with a lot of dialogue. The amount of dialogue should be cut. I think this movie was good with the storyline, cinematography, and it had awesome special effects. Also, I really like this movie because it had a lot of diversity. That's basically it, and I give it a 7 out of 10 stars. This movie will return for part 2. I hope it will better than part 1.

","Thats right. I dozed off for a good 15 minutes and I'm not sure what I missed because when I opened my eyes I was still up on what was going on. Now I know that people are defending bad reviews by saying that we are being homophobic or do not appreciate a hero with a disability. Nope! I didn't mind that at all. Sitting with my grandson while to male heros kissed didn't much bother me. I mean that's pretty well mainstream nowadays. Really the only issue I had with the deaf hero was the fact that my grandson can't read the subtitles fast enough to know what was going on and I wasn't going to bother other watchers reading it to him. The fact is the movie was just plain bad. I honestly thought I was watching a DC movie. Little to no character build up, a plot that was never really 100% understood and one of the most anti climactic endings I have seen since the Blair witch project. I wanted so badly to like it as I told my grandson that this is THE movie in Marvel's next phase and will set the foundation to future movies. I hope I am wrong there. I thought to myself afterwards that it was like if you never seen a marvel movie and started with the first avengers.

","Presenting a new aspect of the MCU proves to be a brilliantly ambitious, yet mixed experience throughout. Marvel has always succeeded in introducing new characters to its universe, further proving it through this film. Each character is given interesting personality traits and ideologies that lend themselves to a personal feel to the film, which most other MCU films have never fully explored. It is only furthered by the entertaining and endearing chemistry provided by the notable cast. The powers of each character are brilliantly utilized to provide visually breathtaking sequences of action and world-building. Despite the amount it tries to accomplish, this film, for the most part, succeeds in illustrating the new aspect of the universe Marvel wishes to explore, creating an existential insight into the world outside of the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy. However, it's also because of this aspect that makes the film at times feel bloated with many pockets of the story that feel unexplored. Although this can be used for further sequels, the amount of story that is thrown on screen may at times feel overwhelming with brand new information being provided with limited screen time. The aspect ratio can also be distracting at times, shifting from gigantic IMAX visuals to standard camera shots without flow in its transition. Despite the number of positives, the film manages to accomplish, the over bloated nature of the film's story feels akin to something that should be made for the small screen, making for a mixed yet interesting viewing experience.",/review/rw7557567/?ref_=tt_urv,Eternals_2021

941,20 March 2023,dakotadickenson-83457,7," Underrated MCU film
","Eternals is by far one of the more different films of the MCU. The film follows a group of immoral beings known as The Eternals that have been living in the shadows on Earth for centuries whose only known purpose is to battle evil beings known as Deviants. After each of them decide to go separate ways thinking they completed their mission, they're forced to reunite once more to fight against Deviants unlike anything they have ever fought before as well as saving the planet from extinction. As far as the movie itself goes, it was definitely a different take on MCU hero's that are all different in their own ways. The story mostly follows Sersi played by Gemma Chan who also appeared as another character known as Doctor Minerva in Captain Marvel who I found was even better in this film than in Captain Marvel. The character I felt stood out the most was Richard Madden's Ikaris. His character development throughout was on point and is definitely one of the highlights of the film. Angelina Jolie as Thena was another highlight of the film as being one of the strongest and powerful of the Eternals and the way she captures it is astonishing. Barry Keoghan's Druig and Lauren Ridloff's Makkari was definitely the best as far as chemistry between two characters in this film goes and their scenes together were some of my favorite. Salma Hayek's Ajax as the leader of the Eternals was great too. I wished we would of gotten a little more of her character than what we got. The character I felt was most frustrating and annoying throughout was Lia McHugh's Sprite. This film honestly probably would of been perfectly fine without her, but I also see why her character needed to be included in the film and I'm not blaming the actress at all, it's the source material given to her that wasn't always the best and didn't sit right with me. Another thing that I felt wasn't as best as far as source material goes is the relationship between Ikaris and Sersi as I didn't feel what I felt us as audiences is supposed to feel when two characters like that are in love. The film is also dragged out a little longer than it should have been and I felt some scenes weren't really necessary to the movie. The rest of the cast that includes Brian Tyree Henry's Phasto's, Kumail Nanjiani's Kingo, and Ma Dong-seok's Gilgamesh we're also great additions to the cast. Overall, The Eternals was a great addition in my opinion to the MCU that may not be as memorable or perfect, but stands out in a way of its own, while it's introducing us to some of the new hero's of the MCU.

It's an enjoyable journey is many ways, bogged down by a constants tension between heavy mythology and comedy one liners, the latter betraying the meddling hands of studio execs and too many script passes. I hope they make another one, in this format there are questions to pursue. A welcome relief from a 9-movie lead up to another over-edited destruction of downtown Manhattan.

It began with the introduction of Shang-Chi and now we get a bunch of new, relatively unknown heroes in 'Eternals'. In a very interesting selection they procured Academy award winning director Chloe Zhao to direct and co-write the film. Zhao does not immediately leap off the page as an MCU style director with her recent success coming from the critically acclaimed drama 'Nomadland'. 'Eternals' is an ensemble piece and introduces a full cast of characters never before seen in the MCU and stars Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Brian Tyree Henry and Angelina Jolie among others.

","The main thing people are being critical about in this movie is how boring and long it was. I will admit, they probably could have cut a half hour out of the movie and it would have been fine. People felt it took too long to find and fully introduce the characters. But I felt it was 100% necessary for the story. This movie had a lot of characters, and it took place over 7,000 years. They needed to introduce and explain what all 10 characters did in those years. Also, we have never seen the Eternals before. In a movie like Endgame or Infinity War, it is full of characters we have all seen and gotten to know, so they don't have to spend a lot of time introducing the characters because that has already been done. But in this movie, there are 10 new heroes we have never seen and know nothing about, so they needed to spend the time introducing everyone. I felt they did a great job at it. This movie also didn't really feel like a Marvel movie. It is all because of positive reasons, like the visuals, how unique it was, the characters, and how ambitious the creators made it. Chlo√© Zhao is unbelievable. This movie was visually stunning. Her style of directing is so unique. She doesn't use very much green/blue screen, most of the scenes are shot on location, and you could tell. The scenes were so beautiful, the locations they went to shoot were stunning. It made the movie feel almost real. This was also one of the most ambitious movies Marvel has ever made. Marvel has a very strict policy on making their movies fairly kid friendly. That is why I was surprised when I saw a sex scene in the film. It only lasted a few seconds and showed no nudity, but I still didn't really like it. Marvel is known for being kid friendly, I don't want them to ruin that with things like this. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is going to be a more scary movie, I rather Marvel be less kid friendly in that way, not the way they did in this movie. They also weren't afraid to kill any of the heroes. Ajak (The leader) ended up being dead a few minutes into the movie. They also killed Gilgamesh, Ikarus, and let Sprite choose to lose her powers to actually live a life. They started with 10 Eternals, and ended with 6. I don't know if the characters will return, but they did die in this movie. Lastly, I loved the characters in this movie. I loved all of the Eternals, they were funny, they had cool powers, cool suits, and the chemistry between the actors was great. They all played their roles perfectly. That is why I can't chose just a few that I like. We can't overlook the legend of this movie, Karun. He is easily, without a doubt my favorite supporting character in the MCU. He was absolutely hilarious. If Marvel made a Karun movie or show, I would watch it, and I would love it.",/review/rw7557567/?ref_=tt_urv,Eternals_2021

993,5 November 2021,parksiet,9," A Breath of Fresh Air for the MCU
","I loved Eternals. Holy crap the critics REALLY got this one wrong. It's a solid masterpiece of a movie and one of the most beautiful, unique and innovative films that Marvel has ever produced, thanks to Chloe Zhao's visionary talent. It isn't your average Marvel movie, hell it doesn't even feel like one. And that's why I love it! It's a breath of fresh air and shows the MCU taking bold, new risks, instead of just using the same type of storytelling. I love the creative choices that were made and how they all make it stand out in such a special way from the rest of the MCU, from the dense mythology, gorgeous visuals and more emotional, character driven storyline. It really taps in to the work of Jack Kirby, from a story and even visual perspective. This movie is still blowing my mind, its one that is getting better and better the more I think about, process and digest it, and I'm sure it will only get better with more viewings! (And god I cannot wait to see it again!) The film is ambitious, but handles everything so perfectly, which Chloe Zhao deserves every praise for! Her direction is stunningly beautiful, incredibly strong and she brings her very nuanced style to the MCU. I love how she puts story and character above the action, and while not one of the action is as big as some sequences from other films, what we get really works for the story! The film has a scope that is so ambitious and epic, feeling a lot like Zack Snyder's Justice League, which for me is a great thing. Zhao's script is also really well done, the mythology is rich and complex, the story is emotional, pure and heartfelt with so much humanity imbued into the characters. The characters were really fantastic and I fell in love with all of them very quickly. I really liked how the movie made every character feel important and valued, and with a cast of 10 main characters I found Zhao balanced their screen time and actions/conflicts really well. One of the best parts of the film is the dynamics and interplay between the characters. The Eternals are all essentially gods, but Zhao, alongside her stunning cast, did such a good job at bringing the humanity to each of their personalities and stories. It's a complex story with differing character motivations and ideologies, and I loved how the end battle was essentially a battle of ideologies as the Eternals sought to develop their own sense of autonomy from the Celestials. I also thought some of the dialogue at the start was a little iffy, but as the movie got going it got better. I loved the humour throughout, there were many really funny moments for sure! And like I said, the cast was perfect, each of the actors brought a warmth and sense of life to their roles. I especially loved Kumail Nanjiani, Richard Madden and Brian Tyree Henry, but it was clearly Gemma Chan's movie. Barry Keoghan was also such a surprise! Kit Harington had a smaller role than expected but I am so excited to see where his character goes moving forward! And that's another thing I loved about the movie; it reinvigorated my excitement for the future of the MCU and showed me how different and new it could get! The world building in the film is excellent, it really fleshes out the cosmic side of the MCU in such a rich and intricate way, making the MCU feel much more grand and complex. The movie essentially is what Ridley Scott's ""Prometheus"" wishes it was, and tells that sort of story but from the perspective of the engineers, which in this movie were the Celestials. I loved how they handled the Celestial scenes, especially in how they showed the physical scale and massiveness of Arishem compared to Ajax and Sersi. The visuals themselves, throughout the entire movie, are absolutely stunning and gorgeous. Chloe Zhao is truly gifted with a sense to capture the perfect shot, with stunning lighting and colour. Its easily the best looking MCU film, and I loved the natural feel that the on-location shooting did for the film. Its truly a feast for the eyes and felt so visually rich because it wasn't all CGI environments and was so brightly lit. I really admire the effort put into the cinematography for this film, and even the CGI looked stunning! The costumes also looked excellent and were nicely colourful! The design of the deviants was really cool, but unfortunately the characters themselves are somewhat wasted and served as better plot devices than villains, but luckily the story has a clever twist later on in the film. The overall villains of the movie are a lot more ambiguous than in a usual comic book movie, and that really worked for me. I really enjoyed the hell out of this movie, and I have to say it is definitely one of the best films that Marvel has ever produced. It doesn't feel like a Marvel movie, it is very much a Chloe Zhao film and that is easily its biggest strength! Please go see it and form your own opinions, I can see how some may see it as divisive, but I was completely swept away by it! It's a triumph; a slow burning story that is epic in nature, beautiful in character development, and has gorgeous visuals. It's something the MCU hasn't seen yet, and has major implications for the future. I respect it alone for the bold creative risks Marvel took in making this film, and hope we see more experimentation from them like this!

","As I watched this movie, I did not find myself emotionally invested with any of the characters. With Iron Man movies, Tony started out as self obsessed, ego-maniac but during the course of these movies Tony has several life changing events (becoming accountable the weapons he builds, almost dying from Palladium, suffering from PTSD) which changes him and I feel for him and find myself rooting for him. In the Captain American movies, when Dr. Erskine makes Steve Rogers promise that whatever happens with the super soldier transformation, that he will stay who he is, not a perfect soldier but a good man, to which Steve holds up his glass and says ""to the little guys"". And when Steve doesn't give up on Bucky through Captain American The Winter Soldier and in Civil War, we can't help getting emotionally attached. In Thor, he too starts off as Odin tells him you are a vain, greedy, cruel boy and then changes during the course of the movie and gives his life to save the town, we get choked up with emotion for him. These are the big three, all the other characters Spider-Man, Ant-Man, Dr. Strange, Starlord, Black Panther, Black Widow, Hulk, Bucky, Groot, Gamora, Rhody, Coulson, Captain Marvel, Scarlet Witch, Quick Silver, Falcon, Loki, Mantis, Drax, Vision, Wasp, Rocket and on and on, we all loved them.

","For the amount of talent working in this movie, Eternals shouldn't be this dreadfully mediocre. Its concept is genuinely intriguing, and there's so much for the movie to explore...and it just doesn't. It misses the mark almost constantly. The characters are undeveloped, Gemma Chan and Richard Madden's chemistry is very poor and they give unusually flat performances (given that they are wonderful actors). Angelina Jolie's character, Thena, is one of the better characters, which is absolutely due in part to Jolie's commanding screen presence. But even she feels underwritten. There are some emotional beats in the film that I feel just aren't impactful. The movie works best when the team is together and working off their chemistry with each other, but there is unfortunately not a whole lot of that and a whole lot more exposition. The script, by the way, is awful. It is completely devoid of nuance. The dialogue is the most cliche, uninteresting dialogue you could possibly imagine. It's kind of tragic, because the whole cast is really giving it their all with the performances, but the screenplay is genuinely such a mess that it undermines the actors' performances. This movie should have been better. There are worse superhero movies, but this is among the ones I don't have much interest in watching again. Venom is a terrible film, but at least I can have fun with it. I can't really say the same for Eternals. It's too poorly-paced and too long.

Kirby's original series was strongly influence by Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYESSY, and the Arthur C. Clarke story it was based on in that worked off the theme of a highly advanced alien civilization coming to earth thousands of years in the past, and then guiding human evolution. In Kirby's book, the title characters are super powered beings who are given the responsibility of watching over development of humanity by the Celestials, a race of giant, omnipotent beings, who will one day return and judge if the human race is worthy of continuing their existence. These 10 Eternals appear to be humans, and live among them, but are forbidden to interfere with the course of human history, standing aside during wars, genocides, and every manner of catastrophe. Their opposites are the Deviants, mutated Eternals, physically ugly, and their sworn enemies, whom the Eternals protect humanity from.

","Eternals is a weaker film when it comes to the overall scheme of the MCU, clearly I've seen better, but for what I got as a stand-alone, it was better than I thought, still mediocre in many ways. I appreciate the attempt at being a slower, more melodramatic compared to the other MCU films. Lots of time characters are just sitting or standing around and talking and lots of it. The only thing that kept me from getting really bored was the occasional fight sequences they'd throw in. I'm not saying I need all action and no substance, but the dialog between the characters was uninteresting, and nothing was really grabbing me emotionally. That brings me to my next issue, I personally know nothing about the Eternals, I went into this film completely blind hoping that maybe the film can help introduce these new characters to me. Unfortunately, that also failed in my eyes. I left the movie knowing only what each character's abilities are, and a few of their names. I was driving home from the theater and I couldn't remember all of their names. That's how forgettable the characters and character development was for me. Also, there was no need for this film to be almost three hours long. Why does every Marvel film have to be near three hours long, some actually reach three hours, but that was the Avengers film which I can understand because they have to cram so much story, characters, and information in such a short period of time, however the Russo brothers did a much better job at delivering and executing those things. Chloe Zhao has shown she is a very gifted filmmaker with Nomadland, but apparently she had plenty of creative control, so I have to criticize Zhao for the overall execution of the character development, and too much exposition. However, I do really appreciate the execution of the action and fighting sequences especially having to do with the Deviants. There was one in particular towards the middle of the film that I was having a good time with. Some of the background shots are absolutely breathtaking, and the cinematography was beautiful as well. These things are so strongly executed that they almost outweigh the negatives I mentioned earlier. But as it stands, it is a mediocre film with bad character development, uninteresting interaction between characters, too much exposition, and too long of a running time; but also has exceptional fight sequences, breathtaking backgrounds, beautiful cinematography, and the score are all that make this film what it is. Therefore I reward it with a solid 7.2/10.",/review/rw7557567/?ref_=tt_urv,Eternals_2021

For a film like ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" which also contains a lot but we've seen them before and the stakes are quite low it's an easier ride. With this film, it's the first time many of these actors, characters, writers, and filmmakers have entered the MCU and while it's without a doubt thrilling and fun, the movie feels it's length and can leave some unfamiliar with the Eternals feeling bored (however I was ecstatic.) I'm excited to see where these characters go in the future and I hope Chloe Zhao is invited back to the table to tell another chapter, as I feel she has some ownership over these characters much like James Gunn to the Guardians. I almost wish the film were told in two parts as it is very similar to Dune in some ways, but take what we can get. Is this the worst of the MCU not by a long shot and it's crazy to see the Rotten score after viewing it, but I can't say I don't understand where some are coming from.

And then, the next hour is mostly the characters debating if they should do something or not, FOR ALMOST AN ENTIRE HOUR. Fortunately I did like the end, the fact that some of them actually disagree with each other is a cool idea I did enjoy. But thats it, the fight at the end was the only story thing I liked, everything else is boring. The characters are also really boring, I dont feel any of them have any personality and maybe its just me but I think their powers are almost the same as the JL and that just reminds me of better written characters (in the comics) that I would be rather watching. Also, there are just too many characters, they should have cutted the cast in half or less.

","Even a day after watching it, I have no idea how to feel about the film. On the one hand, the creators clearly had ambitions and in some scenes the scale is quite felt, the characters are interesting and well revealed, and the director's style distinguishes the Eternals from most Marvel projects. But on the other hand, from a screenplay point of view, the movie is clearly not smooth, interfering with many moments in the MCU, the characters, just as heroes, and not as individuals, are secondary, the action and technical component are not impressive, and most of the potentially interesting ideas have not been properly disclosed. . This is the case when it is difficult to say in the end whether the film is definitely good or definitely bad. Perhaps that is why the Eternals divided the audience so strongly into those who protect it and those who drown it. Probably, this is the same film with which everything will become clear only with time.

Films stars Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Richard Madden, Salma Hayek, Kumail Nanjiani, and the main person in this flim Gemma Chan. Also Manny more. Gemma was great she really grown on me from start to finish. Richard Madden was ok I never seen his films before he good I would like to see him in more films. Kumail was the funniest one in this film but the only part is the one part with the Indian movie filming that was kinda cringy as a person with Indian background I think marvel should give it another try. Salma Hayek I love her films it's great. Was she a right choice for this role. I did you could have gotten someone a little more flexible meaning someone with the knowledge of Superhero films.

The Eternals vary but I found all characters enjoyable to different extents although Sersi could be quite flat at points. Ikaris was a fairly interesting villain whose motives made sense and Richard Madden did a good job. His death was a bit underwhelming and he had potential for future films. The other villain the sentient Deviant was interesting, but more character development could have led to something great. Kingo and his sidekick were a lot of fun, although his departure at the end was kinda odd. Sprite had an interesting arc due to her upset at being unable to do adult things, Phastos is someone I would be interested to see more of, Makkari and Druig were both interesting and I'm eager to see more along with Thena. Ajak and Gilgamesh played their parts well and while Dane's role was small, I am eager to learn more (especially after the post credits scene). The plot made for an interesting story and parallels with the pro-life/pro-choice debate. The Celestails were presented well here and I'm eager to see more of them in the MCU.

","I'm not super into the MCU anymore. I didn't want to see this movie, but my friend bought me a ticket so I decided to go see it with him. I sat through the entire movie bored and confused at what was happening and why. They started setting up all the eternals super hurriedly, and spent the rest of the movie trying to finish setting them up through the entire movie, and character motivations were introduced, but then they wouldn't really go anywhere, some characters would die and it was hard to care because we barely had any time to get to know them. The humor was ok, but often a bit out of place. The characters' powers also weren't clearly defined so it was hard to really understand everything they could do. Probably my least favorite part though was the villain had potential to be super interesting, but his motivations were wasted on a character that was way too powerful for his own good. It seemed like he couldn't be harmed or beaten, and even when it seemed like he met his match later on in the movie, he just breaks free of whatever restraints were holding him and goes to confront the ""main character"" if you could call her that. This movie didn't know what it was doing. It was rushed, bland, uninteresting, and was riddled with so many plot holes that were even apprentice from watching the movie once. Not recommended, stay far away. In fact stop watching MCU movies. They're not that good.",/review/rw7557567/?ref_=tt_urv,Eternals_2021

1515,7 November 2021,Benslie,9," A breath of fresh air for the MCU but not perfect
","One of the best things about this movie is the gorgeous cinematography. I feel like what helped in this department was how you can tell they always tried to film on location instead of in a studio so they could easily get natural lighting instead of needing to use studio lighting. I feel like we all need to thank Chole Zhao, who directed and co-wrote this movie, for choosing to film on location and giving us that great cinematography. Chole Zhao also did a great job bringing her unique directing style to the MCU which helped make this movie stand out from the others with it not following the beat-for-beat Marvel formula. This is easily one of the most original Marvel movies to date so far but I will say that despite that the story for this movie is lacking. This movie is very much a more character-driven story in comparison to the other Marvel movies that are action-driven and because of that I just never felt myself getting fully hooked. Not to say the characters are bad when in reality it's far from that but I was always waiting for the story to speed up. I feel like my biggest issue wasn't the story but the pacing and how unfortunately it affected the story. This entire movie felt like the first part of a two-part series where it was building up the characters before a big fight in the next movie so when the ending happened, I was surprised. The best way to explain the pacing of this movie is up until the ending the movie is slow but once the ending happens it goes at the right speed. I will say that the action scenes in this movie were really well done and felt like something we haven't seen yet in the MCU. Another big surprise for me was the special effects in this movie and just how they looked pretty well done throughout the entire movie. The characters in this movie definitely weren't the worst part of this movie since despite the story not fully giving them much all of the actors gave it they're all in this movie. My personal favourite actor in this movie was Lia McHugh, who plays Sprite, because despite being so young in this movie, she still was able to bring real emotions to her character both serious and comedic. I also really enjoyed Lauren Ridloff, who plays Makkari. The final thing I want to mention is the score, composed by Ramin Djawadi, for this movie. I enjoyed that he didn't just keep it as one type of music style but also included other styles from different cultures.

I have to admit that this is probably one of marvel more ambitious movies. While being something that I doubt anybody would've probably expected. I'm not really a reader of the Enternals specifically, but I am familiar with who they are and the connection with the celestial's and how they're basically marvels version of the new gods. Many of those elements feel right for the picking for a new type of Style and theme that we have not seen yet. A very Stoic philosophical cosmic storytelling. Unfortunately the fact is eternals is kind of a chore to get through. The story is overall a incoherent mess it doesn't feel like it takes the time to actually set out pacing to make sort of a more natural flow. In many of these segments, the film is told specifically through flashbacks Between a days ago, to ancient times to the present. It feels like most of these flashbacks really don't serve much for a purpose in the overall plan what's going on in the present. It doesn't really flesh out all the characters, to really know all of them. If It probably started when they arrive on earth in Mesopotamia and then it showed pretty much more of their involvement of how they've evolved on being on this planet with humans. Seeing how their actions shape humanity it would probably add more depth, to decisions made near the end of the film. It also doesn't help that while the film tries to make room. The fact that you have 10 new characters in a single film. Some obviously get way more screentime then others such as Icarus and Sersi. Who are probably the most developed out of all of them but still throwing pointless romance drama between them is just tiresome. Also not helping that Icarus is bland as cornflakes for majority of the movie. One of the more funnier members of the Team is Kingo who basically poses as a Bollywood star pretending to be all the descendants In this fake family. He actually gets a few good laughs. Same with his human manager. While others like Selma Hayek and Angelia Jolie characters are so forgettable. Especially Angelia who does so little,that spirte has more character then her. It's a shame that the films faults on so many of these aspects. Because at the same time you can see elements of the film where a lot of this could work and you actually have a good premise there's a scene where they're in the Aztec empire and conquistadors are invading and they're arguing about not getting involved but one of them wants to get involved and one of them is actually responsible for the technology of guns. I mean it offers some good themes if only they would've stuck to one story instead of multiple things. The action is really generic as well many visuals especially the use of this gold wire effect that is used constantly throughout the whole film. It just doesn't look good it looks terrible it looks unfinished. Along with the deviants who later in the film once you're aware what's going on these guys are even more pointless and irrelevant to the bigger picture. Really their all just generic monsters. It doesn't help that the main Deviant you barely remember is around. Overall Eternals is just a mediocre at best film it has very terrible Pacing. It's character development and many jokes don't really flow feel natural or even that funny. The biggest highlight of the entirety of the film is the fact that the celestial's are alive and active in the MCU meaning that cosmic entities such as Galactus or the beyonder are possible for furture installment.",/review/rw7557567/?ref_=tt_urv,Eternals_2021

","For the past 7,000 years, a race of extraterrestrial beings known as Eternals have lived on Earth at the direction of Arishem (David Kaye) who has tasked the Eternals with fighting creatures known as Deviants which feed on intelligent life. While supposedly the last Deviant was killed 500 years ago, the Eternals continue to live on Earth until otherwise dictated by Arishem. When Eternals Sersi (Gemma Chan) and Sprite (Lia Mchugh) are attacked by a Deviant bearing powers similar to an Eternal, they are joined in the fight by fellow Eternal and Sersi's former lover Ikaris (Richard Madden) and drive it away. With the Deviants returning, the group set off to find the rest of their fellow Eternals beginning with their leader Prime Eternal Ajak (Salma Hayek), but find she has been killed leaving them in a race against time.",/review/rw7557567/?ref_=tt_urv,Eternals_2021

It features spectacular visuals with a distinctly elegant style fitting of its cosmic stakes and mythological inspiration. It includes artful composition even in its more mundane scenes. It explores what it means to be human, and it explores its decidedly alien protagonists' humanity while remaining engaging the whole time. It grapples with philosophy and morality more deeply and with more nuance than could possibly be expected of a franchise blockbuster, and it does so without dumbing down any of it. It includes large-ensemble interpersonal drama fitting of its mythical proportion, and it makes it meaningful even while introducing all its characters for the first time.

Then they do, and they get back together after having relationships and so forth in and then they are confused on their programming to do their job. Most of them love Earth and one or two don't care. Why? Then this new Celestial is to be born and then they (most) of them stop it before it blows the Earth up. It didn't make sense. Special effects were done well as the acting. They threw in some big well know actors and there you have a movie. Didn't anybody backup and see how the script just did not relate to anyone. Then the introduction of new MCU characters at the end didn't help matters. Now that the movie has been out for a while this movie has put Marvel in a pickle. How to tie all these characters into other MCU franchises that are in the Disney plus collective. Or not? I like to think there was a plan, like the Avengers: Infinity Wars and Endgame to have all the new characters somehow. But I am getting away from the review of this movie. I really had a hard time to care about these characters and although they had some fun personalities, there interaction was flat. I suspect mostly because they had little time in this massive movie to develop the characters and feed all the action in between. It just didn't keep my attention due to the constant moving on to the next scene and character. You never get the chance to breathe with the character's emotions and why? There should be moments of reflection and moments of intensity in action that holds your attention that you want to care. But doesn't give you a chance for the suspense and release. I felt the story was just pushed through to get it in. It would of made more sense to make this story an 8 episode series on Disney plus. So although I felt the story didn't work and there were too many characters introduced in this movie, I did like the music, the special effects, the acting, and the scope of the movie to give it 5 stars.",/review/rw7557567/?ref_=tt_urv,Eternals_2021

The visuals are beautiful and you can really feel the chemistry between the characters, in ways that can't be felt in most other Marvel movies to be honest.

By far Marvel's most ambitious movie to date, crossover events notwithstanding, and certainly it's most beautiful, both visually and poetically.

","Whilst the plentiful use of monologue and complex and at some times convoluted plot may dampen the experience for some, The Eternals is a testimony to future things to come in the MCU, giving us the greatest look into the past that the MCU has had since Guardians of The Galaxy, and also a double dose of what to look forward to in the future. An extensive look into the history and origins or the universe and earth is ever present throughout the film, perhaps too much for some people liking, but for fans hoping for more theories and branches to the MCU, perhaps not enough and perhaps opening more doors of opportunity and confusion than the MCU and it's fans were ready for. The action sequences speak for themselves, beautifully crafted and choreographed, emotionally charged at points, and full of surprise and tension. Perhaps more than other MCU entries to date, you may find yourself on the edge of your seat. For some, the action may not be frequent enough, but it can only be agreed upon that when it is there, it is brilliant. Plot holes do loom in the film but not to an extent that harshens the progression of the film, however some unanswered questions and odd behaviour do complicate the plot from a viewers perspective, but it is nothing that the film gets stuck in the mud over. The visuals and cinematography live up to what you expect from the trailer with fabulous scenery and eye catching sets, The Eternals does not fade away from being extravagant. The film does a sound job developing character and gives wonderful unique aspects to all of its large ensemble, mixing comedy with tragedy, and action with recount. It is safe to say, for those who enjoy the intricacies of a shared universe, this film will be very satisfying. It is safe to say that fans of the cosmic MCU will be pleased. And it is safe to say that fans of the emotional and character side of the MCU will walk away with glee. But for those who may find it all a bit too over the top, or long, or slow at times, The Eternals may feel slightly underwhelming.

I feel like they just dumped way too much information about brand new characters all at once and it's abit much to care about all of them at once, it just doesn't feel like a marvel movie. The deviants are a little bit boring in terms of villains and again they aren't given enough time in screen for us to care who they are. The effects in this might be some of the best in a marvel movie and I really like some of the costume design on the characters, some of them are a little similar looking at first but for the end fight scene they look really unique and interesting. I love that this film introduces more celestials as they are some of the coolest characters in the marvel universe and they look amazing in this movie and I can't wait to see more of them I'm future films. The end credit scenes are pretty exciting and they do keep me excited for future films.

","A rather risky and ambitious project, which, in the case of converged stars and other fortunate circumstances, could become a turning point in the MCU. In fact, this is what he turned out to be, but most viewers (especially fans) are not happy with this. Yes, the story here is different, there are no usual formations of characters, and the GG is not opposed by villains with identical abilities. Non-linear narrative breaks the harmony of the film, but you get used to it easily. And by the beginning of the credits, you understand what, why and why these scenes were shown and in that sequence. If the film is scolded, then only for a number of questions and illogicalities that it leaves behind. But they scolded the conditional Raganarok for the same thing or for much bigger problems, God forgive me, the Finale? Not! The vast majority were delighted. Here, if desired, you can find logical answers to many questions. And now briefly for the rest: the actors are chosen well and play well. Inclusiveness does not strain the eyes and is quite self-explanatory. And white and heterosexual men are shown to us even more than we expected from the first promo. Each hero has his own story arc and his own moments of glory. Problems can only arise with remembering names. The main plus of the film is the presence of any eggs from the scriptwriters, who for once brought plot twists to the MCU (a little more than one) and showed a real confrontation between the characters not for life, but for death, in contrast to the children's brawls in ""The First Avenger 3."" Lots and lots of details. The music is interesting and stands out from its predecessors for the better. Chloe Zhao - well done and coped with the task perfectly.

Angelina Jolie was definitely casted wrong and not used at all to the level of her talent. The characters ""abilities"" were silly; the monsters were annoying. The lead Deviant was a missed opportunity and underdeveloped. Other underused characters or missed opportunities? Lauren Ridloff as Makkari, the mute Eternal. There is so much more that could have been done with this character other than putting her in a ship for thousands of years with a bunch of books. What???

Moreover, while GOTG could avoid most of the existing MCU context (post Avengers 1) because its setting was in deep space, The Eternals takes place on Earth and must address the recent MCU events.

The others either don't feature enough to care or too much so they're simply annoying (Kingo, Sprite). Ikaris my word, can acting be any more wooden. Most of the visuals are quite good, the only reason for any stars on my review. Babylon looks amazing. The plot is forgettable, the movie feels like it's 80% set in darkness or half light.

Remove these scenes and the film will not be worse for sure.

Lots of characters, human or something else, just dont need to be in the movie at all for it to work. Besides that a lot of the choices that the main characters make just don't seem logical. They're thousands of years old and still they're heavily influenced by impulses, emotions and beliefs. And yet when those very beliefs are challenged most show little to no actual reaction. It is also odd that a god programmed them to not be able to evolve, yet they did. For example, upon finding out that Olympia had never even existed and that they were programmed and had their memories erased constantly, they fairly quickly reasoned it is ok to resist their god like creator. Now If they can do that with such little effort I'd say Arishem was a fairly poor programmer who made the same mistake twice (deviants also evolved).

","This movie definitely doesn't deserve all the hate it is receiving. I get that some people are used to fast paced superhero movies and have no patience for dialogues and slow script build ups; but I can't agree with them. Clho√© Zhao is magnificent here; all the ten characters evolve well and we attach to them and understand their motivations, the twists and turns the movie throws at us using the epic concepts are incredible and everything is visually convincing. Moreover, this is a breaking point for Marvel's formula; Eternals stretches the old recipe and, although it still has past elements, it focuses on telling the story in a more mature way. This is a philosophical movie and it goes beyond Marvel's lore to deal with humanity's unanswered questions and create a cosmic ecosystem; it deals with life and death, explores worlds and creation and uses a huge scale to infer its grandiosity. Don't listen to the bad reviews and go watch Eternals with an open mind, be ready to embark on an epic long story that requires attention and patience, just like great deep movies/series always did; Lord of The Rings, Game of Thrones, etc. Beyond the amazing script and directing, Eternals is a mark for cinema diversity and inclusion; we finally have real people leading a Marvel blockbuster and minorities being respectfully represented; black, Indian, Korean, deaf, gay, immigrants with real immigrant accents. The importance of ethnic and cultural representation is enormous and it is already resulting in the banning of the movie in many countries; and don't get me wrong, but this is great! Marvel is affronting prejudice all over the globe. Although all the actors are incredible and everyone will have their favorites, I have to highlight mine; Brian Tyree Henry and Kumail Nanjiani are brilliant here and I want to see more of them. Overall Eternals is a great movie, very well structured with an ambitious script and a huge importance for Hollywood's scenario today.",/review/rw7557567/?ref_=tt_urv,Eternals_2021

The fighting sequences and strengths of the characters were powerful and very entertaining to watch. I love the dynamics seen between the characters.

","We've waited a looooong time for ""Eternals"" to hit Dis+ thanks to Covid. The story/plot is great, it's epic, and the production values are Tier 1. However, and this is why people are complaining so much, directory Chloe Zhao just isn't that experienced. This is her second feature-length film besides the tepid ""Nomadland"" and frankly it was just too ambitious to think she could swing it. Her interpretation is that ""Eternals"" are basically super-humans - with all the frailties and faults of humans, instead of a separate race of beings that you'd imagine would hopefully be more cosmically focused than so earth focused and a lot more mature/evolved. It just trivializes the epic nature of the story to have such powerful beings vulnerable to love, hate, anger, bias, and betrayal. And a short note about the climax, ugh, basically an unrealistic deus ex, a real disappointment. Finally, major Marvel content of this nature should be a streaming series, not shoehorned into the compriomising 2+ hr format of a film, it cheats everyone of its real value. This could've/should've been a 9 or 10 level Marvel actioner but it's in the 6 to 7 range due to all these problems/issus.",/review/rw7557567/?ref_=tt_urv,Eternals_2021

Too many unnecessary scenes and almost every single character isn't interesting. The ending and many parts throughout the movie were head scratching and at some points I even laughed. Not laughing in a good way. Anyone who gives this movie anything over a 6. Hasn't watched a marvel movie before. I said short and sweet. So I will stop talking now.

Also, when you have a main character named Sersi, who happens to share a name with a main character from a blockbuster like Game of Thrones, don't cast two other guys from GoT as leads.

Unfortunately her touch is hardly found in Eternals. Yes there are some instances in which it can be seen and they are gorgeous but for the most part I felt like the movie could have been directed by a whatever decent director that the result would have been the same and so I was a little disappointed. But this problem is only mine, linked to my expectations. The real issue with the movie is that it tries to tell too much in a much shorter time than needed and the result is pretty superficial and generic. At least it isn't boring even if lengthy and this allows to watch it without wanting to stop but it gave me nothing and I think it is hardly rewatchable.

First, we are going a hundred years back, and suddenly we return to present day, what was sometimes confusing. The acting was on the middle, average, but the superpowers was disappointing. When you make superheroes, do something original at least. Super Strength? Already made, Hulk. Super speed? You know that one, The Flash. Do you know what I'm trying to say? That all of this superpowers in this movie, was already used by several made-up superheroes, so I couldn't feel the feeling off something new and interesting, that made the action scenes weak, because you knew how they were going to attack.

It's not your typical Marvel movie, which I found refreshing. First off, it's visually stunning. I read that the director used visually pleasant filming locations rather than rely on green screen production and I can say that was a great idea. Besides having great cinematography, the actors all had great chemistry. The movie was heartwarming, had just enough action and a few comedic moments that were placed well. The story itself was very easy to follow and gave us just enough background to know who these characters were and why they are important. Yes, I admit it was a long movie, but there is not much you could cut out without ruining the story. I honestly feel bad for Zhao, the director, because she did an amazing job. Hardcore Marvel movie fans are giving this movie bad reviews because I guess they are used to the terrible drivel we get nowadays with all these superhero movies.

However there's not much more there and certainly not enough to save this delivery. The film soon gets too slow, too long, too filled, a little mixed up, and unbearably pretentious. Characters are just too many to convincingly develop but at trying, it sacrifices steady structure and splats the tone all over the place.

","While this is movie is severely flawed, and does get confusing, and might piss you off because of the run time, I won't say this movie is bad. In fact I really liked it. The story and writing isn't great. But what makes this a really enjoyable movie, is the acting, the visual effects, and the fact it dives deeper into long Marvel comic book lore. What's even more surprising I feel about this movie are the actors. I'd figure people like Angelina Jolie or Selma Hayek would play the characters to get the main focus, but I like how this movie gives them more a supporting role. Which I think is a good move, since as great as Selma and Angelina are as leading ladies, they still manage to still be great as supporting characters. What I really liked (also) is nothing in this movie felt phoned in or like the actors where sleep walking through a performance. Some might call the performances ""dull"" or ""boring"" or just flat out ""awful"", however i don't see that, i see exactally what i was expecting from a movie, about cosmic aliens, who obviously don't have the same emotional range like everyone else. But when any of the actors have to just act with their body language or facial expersions, it feels really honest and powerful. Everyone is honest and gives plenty of subtle passion and reserved energy, which is the sign of a good actor. But as I stated, the writing in this film isn't great. A lot of it involves non-leaner story elements having to do with big revelation (the kind you see in game of thrones). Basically its broken into two different movies, one that's backstory, and the other has to do with the main story. But I understand why Marvel did this. As it sets up the eventual introduction of the X-Men and mutants into the MCU, since the Eternals are a major part to the back story of the mutants origins. All in all this movie is good.

2098,13 January 2022,ohroonoko,5," Soulless
","Having just completed watching all MCU films in timeline order over the past 6 weeks, I can honestly say that this is the absolute worst of them. For perspective, the lowest I rated any of the MCU films was a 7 (Thor: Dark World), and maybe just one or two I rated an 8, and all the rest were 9's and 10's. My ratings are more heavily weighted towards story and characters first, then on acting and directing, and less so on action and special effects. Part of the problem with this film is the fact that it has too many new superheroes, whereas we are used to seeing characters introduced two-three at a time per movie. That just doesn't allow enough screen time for each character so that the audience invests in that character. Therefore the drama and emotion is lost. Like, I really didn't care that Ikarus flew into the sun, or that Ajak died, or finding out that Ikarus betrayed his brethren. As an MCU film, it will be held up to the others by the standard of audience-character attachment and I was not attached to any of the Eternals by the end of this movie. Another important attribute of the MCU films is humor, and this one fell flat for the most part, although Kumail Nanjani deserves praise for shouldering the burden of bringing humor to this film- he was very good, as was his sidekick character- but there just wasn't enough laughs like I've come to expect watching an MCU film.

This is what I think the movie excels at, basically doing a beautiful job showcasing the humanity of each one of the characters. It is a movie about a family, something that the Avengers have been telling us they are for years, but unlike them, this group actually feels like they love each other; and so, when conflict arises between them, it feels complex and nuanced. Though the plot stakes are huge already, it's the emotional stakes that are given a chance to shine... and I was able to enjoy that a lot. The cast is large, and so it's unfortunate that a few characters didn't have a chance to be fully explored, but I wouldn't say it was a true downside.

2226,28 November 2021,sambat-65739,2," The decline of the MCU continues...
","First, the visuals. This by far the most gorgeous MCU movie. However, there are a number of CGI effects that are rough for a Marvel movie, which shouldn't happen as often as it does considering the enormous budget Disney typically pours into its large action superhero movies. Second, the characters. It has 10 characters, which is an absurd number to care about, but is comic accurate. It is for this reason that Eternals should've been a TV show or two-part movie. However, considering that the movie is 2 hours and 37 minutes long, the characterization should be more developed than it is. Some of the characters do have interesting motivations, but not enough to save the movie. The writers' attempts to forge a bond between the characters become a copied and pasted version of the dynamic we've seen in other Marvel movies. They attempt to create this bond through jokes (which do land), banter, and tender moments (some of which land), but unfortunately these are not used effectively enough to guide the audience into feeling anything beyond basic surface emotions for the characters. Third, the MCU has its first sex scene. It is brief and not explicit, but completely unnecessary to the plot and characters and was avoidable. Fourth, the pace. This movie rushes forward, then slows down, then rushes forward, and so on. It typically goes between fight scenes with Deviants and philosophical discussions. This is very annoying because, while entertaining, the fights with the Deviants begin to feel repetitive and like they are there to fill the runtime. It is as if the movie cannot decide where it's trying to go, so it lurches back and forth. Fifth, the story. I loved the high concepts and backstory this movie introduced. Thev were certainly the strongest part of the movie. They made me excited for the future of the MCU. However, this movie feels more like a setup movie than an actual movie we are supposed to care about. It is forgettable, except for the things it sets up. As mentioned before, the Deviants seem to be there to entertain and fill the runtime, not to meaningfully contribute to the story. By the end of the film they almost feel like wasted villains. The story becomes interesting when the high-concept philosophical issues are being explored. Finally, the movie is mostly well-acted, as would be expected with a cast of this caliber. However, some of the actors seem to be bored with the material they've been given. I would be too. The two post-credits scenes are worth the wait.",/review/rw7557567/?ref_=tt_urv,Eternals_2021

","'Eternals' is a visually appealing piece, however lacks all the other fundamentals of a good film. The storyline was at (many) times all over the place, and I was left confused at many points in the film as well as feeling little sense of any solid direction. The characters, played by a notably A-list and diverse cast, were for the most part underdeveloped which let down the actors, and the characters failed to provide any substantial depth or arc to this film (however I felt most captivated by Nanjiani's character). Additionally, the film drags on far longer than it needed to due to the poor pacing of the story, and ultimately finishes on an underwhelming and somewhat messy note. The fighting scenes, and in particular the final battle sequence, rely heavily on stunning but over-the-top visual effects to keep the audience engaged.

","I definitely had high expectations going into this with the director and the amazing cast (whom I enjoyed their acting on this film! ) and it being a Marvel film. There isn't one Marvel film that I've seen where afterwards I felt disappointed but this one I did. A lot. It felt like a very long movie rushing backstories from second person perspective and then the present day happenings. I always felt like I was missing an emotional connection to the characters, their backstory and why they were how they were present day. Then when I finally cared about a character they were killed! Gilgamesh was my favorite. I haven't read the comics but I understand if that's how the origin story goes but it was frustrating to have so many of the ""Eternals"" killed. Ikaris I finally started to like and was connecting with his romance to Sersei but that went nowhere. Ikaris could have been such a great redemption character but they just had him fly into the sun with zero emotional reaction from his ""family"". Why build a character so much and give him the most backstory just to kill him off with zero emotional payout? The CGI was also not very good. Obviously the monsters and special effects aren't real but good CGI at least temporarily helps you imagine it could be. With this movie it always felt fake and a bit cheap but very overdone? Thena was also a frustrating character that again with better character development and backstory maybe I would have liked more but her just watching her family get killed and not do anything but then later exact revenge seemed a bit too late. Where was that bad assedness earlier? Lastly the Deviants. There were some great moments that made you want to know more and then the storyline always went stale. It just was too much going on but left you feeling like a lot was missing. I don't know.

2364,6 November 2021,tomblakey-27156,6," Eternals is so Fustrating
","Eternals is a painful movie for me. On one hand it's stunning visuals and incredible cast make me love it but the movie has too many problems for me to like it too much. Before it was released, the reviews started coming in from the critics giving it it's now infamous rotten tomatoes score. My statement on this is that I feel really bad for the movie and I still do. It had everything going for it from the cast, the teasing of there return and expansions on them with some cameos at the end (No I'm not talking about the main guy but the other guy who came with him, some sort of lilaputchian I think). But the movie tries to introduce 10 characters at once and only makes me care about maybe 5 at most. Although I thought that the deaths of some characters were sudden and took me off guard. The main problem really is that fact that I don't necessarily like the characters. I felt nothing for people like Ajax or Ikaris even though they were extremely crucial to the plot. These problems really stick out from me enjoying the movies visuals and scale (which is massive and does fit the movie even though some parts are a bit jarring). But the fact that I just don't care about most of the eternals really made me not care for the plot, such as how the world of captain marvel is great but Carol isn't (But better than most of these guys). The only thing I haven't really talked about the action sequences and I have only one thing to say, why Chloe Zhao to direct this. They're ok, just like Nomadland (On the same greatness level, don't think that Nomadland is an action packed thrill ride). This is a heavy superhero fighting movie that really doesn't fit the director, even though she is great and definitely deserves her two academy awards, it just shouldn't have been her movie. In conclusion, I do prefer Nomadland (for me low 7/10) to this but I don't think eternals too bad. But I think that the fact I liked the marvel studios titles (I love Pink Floyd's 'Time') more than almost all the scenes does say something. But I'd say if you're an avid MCU fan I would still go and see it, and stick around for the two post credit scenes for the cameos I mentioned earlier (just ignore the actor cameo in the first not the second(It is just a voice in the second though so don't get you're hopes up to much)).

Some of the characters made a lot of questionable choices, I am not sure what the writers were thinking. This made some characters not likeable at all. Also it must have been tough for the director to make choices in the cutting room because there were too many arcs and not all of them could be realised.

Not sure why they wasted the budget for her role. Anyone could have pulled off what they gave her. Her 4 lines of dialogue land flat. Watch this because you need to. It's part of the whole MCU.

2473,11 November 2021,mmsanders-75067,10," LOVED IT! A new favorite!
","Let me just say, I loved this movie. Excellent portrayals from a star studded cast. Much like Shang-Chi (another top ten from the MCU) you don't need to have a huge background knowledge to enjoy it. Going into it I'd say the only thing you need to know is that the Snap happened, making it an easy view from someone who isn't super well versed in the MCU. It does expand on some previous ideas, but no prior knowledge is needed. It does an ensemble cast well, giving you just enough from everyone to want to know more, but not throwing too much at you. That being said, it is undeniable that Gemma Chan's Sersei is the main character, even if she herself doesn't recognize it at first. I believe this movie has some serious rewatch ability, you'll get what I mean after you see it! The visuals are stunning to watch and the magic is unlike anything we've seen thus far. Academy award winning director Chlo√© Zhao shines with this piece. It is also the most diverse MCU film we've seen to date, having and equal balance of male and female main characters, a racially diverse cast, a canonical queer main character, a deaf main character (and the MCU's fist deaf superhero!), as well as an excellent portrayal of the different kinds of love. You have familial, romantic, and true, deep, friendship. This is the found family that the OG Avengers wanted but never quite achieved. The only real fault I have with this movie is the sex scene. It isn't explicit and you don't see anything other than faces, collar bones, and I believe a back, but I just didn't care for it. Overall a wonderful and fantastic film that stands wonderfully on it's own but does a wonderful job of setting up future stories.

2475,6 November 2021,rfloom,5," I genuinely feel like I watched a different film than the critics
","I don't get how a film like Ant-Man & the Wasp can get the kind of reviews it did while this gets the kind it did. That movie was so bland and boring and forgettable. I think the same for the MCU Spider-Man films as well as Thor Ragnarok. I do not understand what makes those good films at all. I feel like such little imagination went into them. While I think representation is important, it doesn't resonate with me personally being a straight white male. So all that aside, I seriously thought this was a freaking awesome movie. I saw so many reviews saying it was the least fun MCU film or way too exposition heavy... and it was confusing how it jumped back and forth through time. I found it to be a pretty simple and straightforward story to follow. The only real exposition dump was when Ashirem or whatever the main celestial name is was explaining everything to Sersi. Otherwise I never felt overloaded with information. I thought the action scenes were insane! Makari has the best speedster special effects I've seen. So much fun to watch. The story had some solid twists, maybe nothing revolutionary, but very few MCU films have that... I don't know man. That ending battle was awesome, the deviants, while they looked like creatures from Pandora in Avatar, still had their own unique feel to them. No I didn't follow absolutely everything, it'll take another viewing for me to do that probably, but overall I thought this was a fantastic entry in the MCU. How in God's name this is the lowest scored film I have no idea. I absolutely loved Shang Chi and put that in my top 5 MCU films and after my first viewing of Eternals I genuinely feel like this is pretty high up in my ranking as well. I officially could not care less what critics say about movies anymore. They also said the post credit scenes were insane, which they weren't at all. I guess if you're a REAL die hard Marvel fan you'll like them. But if you are, you've already seen the movie so yeah.

","Like most people, my excitement for this movie was not where it usually was for a Marvel movie mainly because I had no idea who the Eternals were and it was completely overshadowed by the release of Spiderman the next month. And yes I wasn't really too excited for Shang Chi either for similar reasons, but that still managed to be a big hit with me and audiences so it is in the realm of possiblity for this to be good. It's the first MCU film that I didn't go to watch in theaters and that was probably the wise decision. Introducing all these characters while trying to tell a story had to be challenging in a 2.5 hour crunch, but because of that, each one of them was already bland on arrival, there is a lot of info thrown at you that you're forced to keep up with, and some moments really had me scratching my head with a few causing me to laugh out loud when that wasn't the intent. There are some really interesting ideas that are introduced as well, mainly with the villain, but there's never enough time devoted to that and the movie kind of brushes it off to the side which was really disappointing. I can appreciate how Chloe Zhao wanted to do this movie in a non traditional fashion, but to me there wasn't enough to stay invested. I really believe that if this had been a Disney+ mini series, it could've been a lot better with developing more connections with the characters, understanding more of the history, and having some epic Marvel action to top it off.

However, as the direction goes different the issue for people who aren't fans of marvel, haven't watched all the movies, and also have knowledge far away from the MCU, but comics is that the movie is way more complex than previous ones. So they start the movie expecting you to know at least the basics of each character, which for some people is not enjoyable. Maybe if they had more time to introduce all of the characters in a previous 10 chapter mini-series before the movie or something similar it would've been better, because it is impossible to present that many characters in one movie. Apart from that great visuals, good storyline, not perfect because some of the scenes are jumping in time but it still understandable. Such great acting as well. The only bad thing of this movie is that it left me needing more, I felt like the story was not completed for many characters and they were killed without letting us know about them and it's disappointing that we won't ever as well. 7, 000 thousand years of history that wants you to explore more.

Marvel is known for taking liberties of its source material but this one, takes basically everything from its source material and throws it in the trash. Instead of trying to make a movie that fans will love, a faithful adaptation of a piece of work by one of the greats, they set out to make the most diverse and boring piece of fan fiction. Of course it all boils down to the straight white male being the bad guy again, and the strong girl boss POC being the bestest ever. They took the most recognizable enteral and turned him into a short evil guy for no reason other than you can't have a straight white man be one of the strongest characters in the MCU. Putting that aside the storyline has more holes in it than deadpool after a shoot out. Their reasoning for not interfering in the snap was that it wasn't connected to the deviants, even though thanos is an eternal with the deviant virus in him, and by him snapping the planet he stopped the progression of the emergence. Also why didn't the enternals try to stop EGO when he wanted to destroy all life? That would've stopped the birth of future Celestials? It's a useless DC knock off that even mentions Batman and Superman in it. They took a colorful series and turned into another generic dark syfy movie. The colors in this should have resembled and paid love to Kirby's style. Much like Thor 3 did. The movie is a mess, flipp flopping time periods, tracking down characters no one knows, that coupled with horrid cgi and bad writing.

Dear god where to start. The ""Deviants"" were about the worst and most bland Marvel Villains I have ever seen. Absolutely no substance or personality to them in any way. Their only purpose was so the main characters could have more fight scenes. Honestly they didn't even need to be in the movie it was so bad.

Well I'll tell you one thing, Kitt Harrington couldn't have been more wasted in this movie. He is in the movie for about 4 minutes and only as the boyfriend of the lead character. As for Rob Stark, you will be severely disappointed in what they do with his character. His actions legitimately make no sense at about the 1 hour and 40 minutes mark. Thats when the movie goes from ok to terrible. The plot is just so bad its hard to even believe that an executive at Marvel OR Disney didn't step in and demand a re-write?

","This film is huge! There is so much going on in this film that it becomes overwhelming at times. But I guess that's fair to say since the Eternals have roamed Earth for seven thousand years. Even though the length of this film is pleasantly long, it still felt rushed at times where some scenes just did not make a lot of sense. There were also some moments where the CGI was very noticeable, which I guess could be expected since most of the film was filmed in natural outdoor environments. However, this film stands alone on it's own pedestal - it is completely different from any other Marvel film, which I quite enjoy! It's evident in the storytelling of this film that there was a lot of thought and passion. I absolutely love how the Eternals were derived and altered from characters of ancient mythology like Athena, Icarus, and Gilgamesh. I also loved the cast of this film! Each actor portrayed their characters beautifully! Watching how this film was made, and listening to Chlo√© Zhao explain her process of casting was intriguing - that not only was each actor able to connect and portray their own character, they were also able to demonstrate their own morals and personalities, too. There was only one actor/characters that I was not a fan of - Harry Styles as Eros did not work for me, I was just not feeling it with him like I was with the others. The Deviants were an interesting breed, or breeds I should say. I don't know how to feel about them. They did not feel as original to me, but they were cool, I guess. I do love the concept of the Celestials, and I hope that we get to see and learn more about them in the future.

","It's been a long time since a new Marvel movie caused such a resonance that the ""Eternals"" caused. Terrible ratings on tommats, low ratings from critics, cries that a complete failure were replaced by cries that this is the best Marvel movie with such constancy that I myself did not know what exactly to expect from the film. Chloe Zhao is undoubtedly an incredibly talented director, ""The Land of Nomads"" is a meditative masterpiece, but will the Oscar winner be able to shoot a major blockbuster for the main cinema franchise? He can! Yes, he can! As has been said several times - ""Eternal"" is not a Marvel movie, it's a Chloe Zhao movie, and this really makes it the best picture of the franchise in a very long time. Chloe Zhao, the director of independent films, was able to remove her author's statement skillfully hidden behind a bright, superhero costume. A meditative, infinitely sweet, meticulously introducing us to each character, the film puts at the forefront of a purely ""Snyder"" question - what kind of life is it for gods among people. A real drama about the gravity of the divine gift, an incredible epic, after watching which I would like to say - a MOVIE. ""Eternal"" has a lot in common with Zack Snyder's Justice League, not only by a long, thorough acquaintance with each character, not only the question raised for consideration, but also the feeling that the film leaves after its viewing. No Marvel movie has ever caused me such a strong sense of GREATNESS with its monumental approach to creating a picture. ""Eternal"" by Chloe Zhao is a brief excursion through all the mythology known to us (after all, it was the Eternal Ones who became the prototypes of all the mythical deities within the cinematic universe), it's an incredible cast, it's amazing characters (every single one!), it's a powerful drama that was not in the KVM before, and it's not a fact what will happen after. Despite the mixed reaction of the audience and critics, despite the not very good fees, I will firmly believe that Chloe Zhao will retain the director's chair in the sequel to ""Eternal"", because right now it seems that no one but her will be able to work with these characters as well. ""Eternal"", like ""Guardians"", feels like the brainchild of only one director, who left behind a gorgeous legacy within the framework of the KVM.",/review/rw7557567/?ref_=tt_urv,Eternals_2021

","Eternals had a slow build up but I liked it. I rather it be slow and they explain their story rather than it feel rushed and make you confuse. The bad is that it was hard to give focus to so much MCU history and so many characters as each of them have their own purpose and role compacted into one movie without losing the entire plot of the movie. The deaf character Makkari didn't really get a story at all while others did which was a shame since this was a historical first for the MCU. I felt like this was a missed opportunity they glanced over. They briefly linked some characters to be the influences of myths and legends, but I don't think it came across as well as they intended especially for people who do not know the myths or the stories, scenes they referenced. The Darwin jab, Ikaris, Athena, etc. I had to explain to my family about some of that. Visuals were great and to be expected. The good part they got right was the diversity that it told as well as a story of a dysfunctional species of superbeings and their relationship to human kind and to themselves. It was relatively relatable because they each had their own strengths and weaknesses which made you understand each of their actions. It also shined a light on how some species change over time and how the ""good"" guys aren't always good and how the ""bad"" guys aren't always bad. Without giving away spoilers, I like the link of how the eternals connect with humanity over thousands of years to end up trying to prevent the humans demise and their own.

Frankly, I feel like they did a bit too much. Some of the characters are fun, but frankly, there are too many to keep track of for a comic film where every character is new to us and the MCU (and I'm fairly familiar with Marvel comics). Furthermore, it feels like there were overt attempts to appeal to the Woke mob (as Marvel seems wont to do these days). It's fine to have an ethnically diverse cast-and of course we have our LGBTQ representation that seems like a requirement these days (though still easily cut for Chinese distribution because they're not going to alienate the PRC of course). But the only white male in the primary cast who seems to have the most power is our surprise villain. It's rather heavy-handed allegorically if you're sensitive to it.

","I think the Eternals did not deserve a spot in the MCU in the first place. However, once they were announced I assumed they would fulfill the role they have in the comics, which is to set up the ""family tree"" behind superhumans, mutants, and other wildly powered races like the Skrull, Kree, and Inhumans. Marvel is also obviously trying to further develop the foundation for magic/supernatural characters, and seems to not be focusing as much on technological/scientific origins for a while. Whatever. This film fails miserably at establishing anything in terms of world-building. They seem to have come up with the idea that the ""message"" of the film should be that you can be who you want, stay true to yourself, and overcome the powers that want to keep you enslaved (but again: only if you stay true to yourself. Thanks Disney!). Even that message is muddied with conflict that cuts every which way through all levels of loyalty and obligation with no worthwhile resolution. The deus ex machina factor is off the charts, with major struggles wiped away by solutions that come from nowhere and take zero effort or sacrifice by characters we don't even care about anyway. The ""big three"" performances (Sersi, Ajak, Ikaris) were wooden and unlikeable, and the ""supporting"" cast only got enough screen time to pique our interest. This movie tried to do too much, and didn't accomplish any of it. 5/10 for managing to keep just enough interest to want to see these characters improved in the future and introduce further potential storylines. SPOILER and huge disappointment: Sprite should have had a much bigger hand in the machinations behind the plot. She's 7000 years old and a bitter, unfulfilled trickster/illusionist. She should have put Loki to shame manipulating the other Eternals to her own ends, like the male version in the more contemporary storylines in the comics.

The few problems I have with this movie is how forced it felt. The forced comedy (thank god they didn't forced Indian accent on the Indian characters though), second, so many tears so often. And it felt forced for almost all the time. Another major drawback was chemistry between characters, they had none. Neither friendship nor love felt real. It was un-Marvel like. Third, there was a change of heart by lead character and the only explanation was some cliches such we they have seen so many good things in people and so on but there were no scenes portrayed that connect which was created by humans being humans. And you guys had Angelina Jolie and you wasted it! Unforgivable. There are some basic plot line gaps, some illogical explanations about their avoidance in interfering during Thanos and other catastrophic events which really makes this one a dud.

Additionally,i believe that the character development in this movie was good enough and if you take into account the level of dificulty the director had to face , i think that she passed the test. Furthermore, before seeing the movie i had a felling that some actors and actresses, like Angelina Jolie, would make to me a bad impression, however i was tottaly wrong the actors took their job very serious and they perform like professionals. One thing in the movie that i didn't like was the continious exposion, some dialogues that repeted themselves and the transitions through time and between places which were multiple and were tiring to the viewer.

","This movie sucked. I mean really sucked.

Makkari lost not his gender but his awesome crimson helmet and visor and most importantly his role as wingman to Ikaris. The only satisfying cast was Ikaris and Sprite. Everyone else was horrible. Gilgamesh was supposed to be super powerful like Thor and Hercules level strength with more of a silent character. I'll stop here regarding the casting and wardrobe, but another thing I absolutely hated was the rock like look of the celestials. They were supposed to have been dressed as giant robotic alien high tech beings....so sad. The story was slow and written by what seemed like a bunch of idiots, just throwing out ideas, to see what would stick. The deviants were written as brainless monsters, when they were much more than that. They resembled the same monster aliens from the Tom Cruise movie live die repeat. Then the Gemma Chan emotionless diva gave no sexiness to the siren character Sersi, it was just a lame duck acting the same as when she played in the movie crazy rich asians. The same can be said of Jolie and Hayek. Too much movie time was given to Phastos' family...who cares! They could have also written out Kit Harrington's character as it basically went absolutely nowhere! This is honestly the worst and glad I waited to see it on Disney + instead of the theaters.

","To be honest, before going to the cinema at the ""Eternal"", I did not entertain myself with any expectations or hopes. Unfortunately, in the last few years, before the release of almost any Marvel studio film, it can very rarely be called ""intriguing"". Yes, you can pick up a lot of other epithets in order to describe your feelings before the premiere of their next tape, but calling the upcoming film ""intriguing"" means that you can expect some surprises from it. This definition does not apply to Marvel films (especially solo ones), because for the most part they are schematic and look like clones performing identical synchronous movements and finally freezing in the same poses. The beginning of the fourth phase is not encouraging yet. I'm not talking about the series, I haven't seen them, but after watching the solo albums about the Black Widow and Shang Chi, the last chapter of the Avengers, which at one time seemed very controversial to me, looks like a fatal beauty who left a big lipstick kiss on her cheek and complete bewilderment from everything,",/review/rw7557567/?ref_=tt_urv,Eternals_2021

","I still don't get why it's being set to be the worst MCU film... Far from it, I was personally pleased and surprised to find out they managed to work it out, despite having such a large cast and a setting as complex as Marvel Cosmic. I enjoyed each character's story line, I think they gave each a well deserved time on screen, and I even bought up their relationships and internal conflicts. It was very well structured. The visuals are gorgeous, the fights scenes are good and well distributed, there is a clear message...

","When your movie opens with a text crawl and that movie is not called ""Star Wars"" it immediately makes me wonder about the rest of the film's quality. Definitely not the MCU's best film, but it's not as unwatchable as I've heard many people claiming it to be. The good things first: The movie is pretty to look at, and despite the fact that these characters have very little writing to them, as immortal beings I'm invested in their plight (mostly because the cast sells the emotional weight of it well) and I'm a sucker for the ""immortality"" trope in any medium of fiction. The actors and actresses do a fairly decent job of of (mostly) making the audience believe the eternals care about each other like family (which helps, because the people who wrote this movie certainly didn't). The twist (which I won't spoil here) is probably the best piece of writing in the film. So it has that going for it? And now the bad: At the end of the day the movie presents a lot of interesting and cool ideas like: Sprite being immortal, but also pre-pubescent and unable to experience adulthood. Or Athena's mind cracking under the weight of living for so long. These are very interesting concepts the movie just doesn't have time to explore. Am I saying I need a multi-film epic about the Eternals? No, not quite, but to have just a bit more time with these characters would've been nice. Especially considering they are almost 1 dimensional from a writing standpoint. On top of that, I can say the director's style (though I'm not familiar with any of her other work) was not suited to the movie (though this has happened with other films in the MCU, so I shouldn't be surprised). And whoever wrote the film didn't provide the best material, which makes you wonder ""who is in Marvel's writing room exactly?"". I think the director and cast did the best they could in two and half hours, and that left us with an average MCU film with some cool visuals, and a few neat ideas. All in all probably should've been left in the hands of a more competent director and writing team. Despite my criticisms I probably enjoyed the film more than most people (including my wife who was next to me throughout) just because I don't need to see highbrow cinema all the time to be entertained. I don't mind a straightforward adventure movie with super-powered people and pretty visual effects. Either way, if you really want to formulate an opinion on this film I suggest going to see it for yourself. Don't listen to the blatantly paid for praise, and don't listen to the people that are simply hating because of ""wokeness"" or ""diversity"", or ""it's just a bad movie"".

","I had heard about all the bad reviews, but I'm the optimistic type because I absolutely love the two Venom movies. I walked into the theatre with very low expectations. I did the same with Michael Bay's TMNT movies and actually enjoyed them even though in reality they're both complete trash. Sadly, this wasn't the case with Eternals. The whole movie had the stank of pretense all over it. I did quite enjoy the Bollywood star Kingo, the angsty Peter Pan type, Sprite and the butt kicking but strangely sensitive Gilgamesh. I also thought that the action sequences were quite cool. I jumped when the deviant swooped in out of nowhere and grabbed Ikaris. Now, that being said, the pacing in this film was awful. I whispered to my wife I'm bored on more than one occasion. I'm usually not the one to talk during a movie but I don't think anyone cared because we all shared a hive mind when it came to what we were watching. I don't have a problem when a movie is long.

Also the names of all 10 Eternals, doesn't go and match with each other. I think the director should use these types of names more carefully with more knowledge.
