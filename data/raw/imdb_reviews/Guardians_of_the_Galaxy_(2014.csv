","Like a lot of other people, I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie. To say it exceeded my expectations would be an understatement. It's a clever and fresh gem in the stable of Marvel films. One of the best they've put out so far. The script is full of funny lines but it's also got lots of good character stuff with earned emotional moments. The action and effects are nice. The cast is great, including those just doing voices. Chris Pratt does a wonderful job blending the comic relief with the superhero. The soundtrack of old pop songs is terrific and integrated into the plot perfectly. The homages to Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and more are fun.

","The biggest appeal of this movie, well there isn't one. There is multiple...the colours, the music, the action and the comedy all combine to create an epic and crazily fun superhero flick. The characters are really well written and all have great chemistry with on another. Along with the dialogue this allows the characters to be quite funny and have some really strong one-liners. The villain isn't terrible either but nothing special, he's pretty much just a strong guy that works for an even stronger guy. The plot is excellent, everything fits together well and moves at a good pace which means the film is very rewatchable. The action and special effects are obviously amazing, it is a high budget marvel movie after all, what do you expect? The soundtrack tho! So good, it pairs excellently with the humour and is brilliantly placed and timed with each scene. Even the actual movie theme(not the MUSIC music) is terrifically triumphant. Coming back to the characters, what makes them so special is that each one of them has a blatantly obvious flaw that means they all have competition with each other and gives so many options when it comes to humour and overall scenes and plot.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

","You might expect a movie studio at the top of its game to play it safe rather than strike out in new, bizarre directions. Certainly, it's hard to imagine any other studio giving the greenlight to Guardians Of The Galaxy - a huge blockbuster movie based on a title unfamiliar to anyone who isn't a comics aficionado, starring a relatively unknown actor playing a character most people have never heard of. And yet, Marvel scores once again with its willingness to head off the beaten track.

","Guardians of the Galaxy starring Chris Pratt as Peter Quill proves to be the ideal leading man, carrying the bulk of the film and making the cocky, self-centered Quill likable enough to garner our sympathies and get us to root for his redemption without dulling the guy's edge. Saldana is the perfect foil for him, cutting Quill down to size before falling for him. It's Diesel and Cooper who steal the majority of the spotlight, however; Rocket and Groot are fascinating and wonderfully realized creations, and the two actors do a superb job of acting through the CGI ""makeup"" to make them stand out as flesh and blood people. Cooper's approach to the killer raccoon plumbs new levels of sarcasm. Bautista also surprises; Drax is written as an alien whose people take everything literally, setting up some choice gags that the former MMA fighter-turned- thespian delivers with perfect timing and the deadest of deadpan deliveries. In the end the film has been praised and the hype has matched the praise, however the film struggles mid way and becomes a decent action film.

Admittedly, I have slowly become more and more bored with superhero films since the high point of DC's 'The Dark Knight' and Marvel's 'Avengers', however 'Guardians' was something that was truly different, something that truly blew me away and has, as a result, become what is arguably my favourite Marvel film. Previous Marvel films have tried too hard to place humour in situations that didn't require it, 'Guardians of the Galaxy' however employs it frequently and due to the constant stream of jokes it works perfectly. Chris Pratt is by far one of Marvel's best casting choices since Robert Downey Jr. as 'Iron Man', even beyond this the other acting bodies were cast perfectly.

","A lot of articles have been written about just how many comic-book hero movies there are in the market and planned for the coming years; they talk about viewer fatigue and market saturation and other such terms. They perhaps have a point but it is hard to really pay it much mind when the genre produces films which are fun and entertaining. With its massive success and the fact that it comes with association to already successful franchises, Guardians of the Galaxy perhaps looks like an easy film, but I do wonder how much people were taking a risk when they greenlit a sci-fi film based on an pretty much unknown comic book series, with a lot of things that could potentially have been really silly; seeing Howard the Duck in here is also a reminder of how something that is quite cool in theory can fail to connect to the audience.

","Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the least known comic books of Marvel. The only reason why the whole world, aside of the fans of the source material, are going to see this because it's a Marvel production, but we should all admit that apart from the comic geek world, nobody knew who Rocket Racoon and Groot were before the film was announced, nobody heard of Starlord before Chris Pratt was attached to the project, and most people hardly knew what it is actually about. While many are still seeking for a Doctor Strange or an Ant-Man movie, we should first get to know something that haven't got enough attention before. And wondrously, these filmmakers introduce this mythology with huge love not only to its own, but also to the fantasy/adventure genre and its old classic form, which easily delivers the sheer fun. But even in the realm of explosions and zany worlds, the best parts of the journey ended up being the scenes with the characters interacting and often to engage a set of great humor and drama.

","Guardians of the Galaxy is a pleasantly surprising SyFy thriller for this generation. The film stars Chris Pratt as Peter aka Star-Lord, Zoe Saldana as Gamora, Bradley Cooper as the voice of Rocket, Vin Diesel as the voice of Groot, and Dave Bautista as Drax. This all-star cast does an amazing job bringing these characters to life. If you like any of the Marvel Avengers movies you will love the humor and action of this family-friendly film.
Peter is a human from planet Earth that has a bounty on his head when Rocket, a talking raccoon that was developed in a lab, and Grout a walking tree come along and try to capture him to collect the bounty on him. In the meantime, Gamora comes along trying to steal the Orb that Peter has in his possession. This group of misfits that end up crossing paths, all at the same time, end up being put into prison where they meet Drax. Drax lost his family at the hands of Gamora's gang, therefore Drax wants revenge and to kill her. This group of enemies ends up having to rely on each other to escape prison. In the beginning, they are trying to kill one another or use each other for personal gain. In order to ensure their personal gain, they end up having to try and keep one another alive. By protecting each other they begin to create a bond.
I feel that the music along with the special effects that were used for this film is what makes it great. The music speaks to what is happening in the film and the emotions that the character is feeling at that time. They were consistent and the use of the music shows the time frame in which Peter left Earth.
The differences in the feeling during the scenes are also shown in the lighting and special effects. The lighting and special effects during the fight scenes show quicker cuts, as opposed to the times during the film when the characters are more relaxed, in which the director pans across the scene moving with the characters.
The director and the all-star cast pull the audience in and do an excellent job bringing the characters to life while leaving them asking what could be next for this group of friends.

","Good lord, I did not expect this movie to be as good as it was. Where as I usually prefer the more mature and serious MCU movies, this is a wonderful exception. It's funny, it's lighthearted and it's imaginative. That does not mean it's lacking good characters. Each of the Guardians have their own struggles and quirks, while also being very likeable and funny. The best scenes in the movie are the ones where the characters just talk, which shows just how good the chemistry between them are. The plot is fairly simple, yet engaging, and the pacing is really good. The action is well made, the emotional moments are good, the climax feels pretty climactic. I do have a few issues though. Firstly, while the villain seems to have a reason for his actions, he's still very one-dimentional and boring thematically. I also got a little tired of the ""end of the world"" trope which seems to be in most superhero films these days, even though this movie handled it better than most other movies I've seen it in.

His taste in music is great as well, so great to the point where my dad actually enjoys these movies, and he doesn't enjoy any superhero movies. This movie is the perfect blend of humor, stakes, and heartfelt moments between characters that have nothing in common. Chris Pratt action career took off here and he is a great lead. Saldana plays Gamora with multiple levels too her character. Even though it's CGI racoon. Bradly cooper and Sean Gunn's Rocket will become an iconic character by the end of these three movies. Vin Diesel is being payed to say Groot. Is it worth it? Probably as Groot has some of the best moments in this movie. Bautista is great humor presence, but also has a great serious scene when he talks about his rage covering what he has lost. Opening scene is iconic. Rooker is great as blue alien Yondu.

","Did I enjoy Guardians of the Galaxy? Absolutely. It was fun and cute and definitely one for sci-fi fans because it was a near-perfect blend of Star Wars meets Avengers (both Disney properties now so that makes some sort of sense.) Yet in the same vein I would hesitate to say that the film sits anywhere near either of those films. As with many comedies and action films the bulk of the movie can be seen in the trailer. The gags in Guardians of The Galaxy felt nearly stale I had seen them so many times in the trailer, there was not much new outside of that. The story was decent as was the performances and they did a decent job of establishing this group of outcast misfits forced to work together and find something meaningful as a make-shift ""family."" The movie was a lot of fun, it just didn't really floor me that way I had hoped. I have a great deal of respect for Marvel in what they've created and I am glad to see them start a new franchise with some connection to the Avengers Universe but this one felt a little bland when all was said and done. There was a ton of action scenes, space battles and hand to hand fights but they were just okay.

77,5 August 2014,ironhorse_iv,9," Guardians of the Galaxy is out of this world fun. Very entertaining.
","When people first heard that Marvel Studio & Walt Disney Company were making Guardians of the Galaxy; a lot of people were scratching their heads, what & why!? First off, the comic book series created in 1968 by Arnold Drake and Gene Colan, wasn't that popular. Second off, there are way better comics that could be made into movies. Third, some critics thought that the movie couldn't be pull off. After all, who will go see a movie about a talking raccoon and walking one word talking tree? This movie prove, every doubter, wrong. It was very successful. You can pinpoint the exact moment in Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy became a success, when the comic book was reboot in 2008 with the Annihilation: Conquest storyline. It was there, that the comic book, got a face-lift, with new characters, and new story lines. The film would use these comics as an outline, but even the film would change things around. As of most comic book characters, there are reimagining's, and different version of people's past. The film writers Nicole Perlman, and director James Gunn change the group from an interstellar group of space cops into a group of criminals turn super-heroes. James Gunn also add some really needed humor and indeed also a very awesome soundtrack, made from 1970s & 1980s hits. Great use of Blue Swede's version of ""Hooked on a Feeling"". The soundtrack on a mixtape in the Walkman, and the pop culture references work for the audience as it was a good way to stay connected to the real world. Too many, out-there fantasy would made the audience feel lost, and disconnect, as they can't relate with the characters. The story tells the story of a theft named Peter Quill AKA Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) who find himself, being chase down by an alien lunatic name Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) after rediscovering and stealing an Infinity Gem from an abandoned city. Along the way, he teams up with an alien Assassin, Gamora (Zoe Saldana), two alien bounty hunters, Rocket Raccoon & Groot (Voiced by Bradley Cooper & Vin Diesel), and a vengeance driven maniac named Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista) to prevent Ronan from getting the stone and destroying entire planets that go against him. I wouldn't say, the plot is anything new from Marvel. It's pretty much the same plot in most of their films. It's just in space, this time. The movie did need a little more exposition, and things did felt a little bit rushed. The whole thing about them, becoming friends so quick seem a bit forced. There were a few good emotional scenes. The acting was pretty good for the main cast. Chris Pratt proves that he can be a main lead actor. Zoe Saldana is alright. Fans and children will probably go crazy over Rocket & Groot. Bradley Cooper did a great job. You really couldn't tell that it was him, the whole time. While, Vin Diesel is limited in his speak; he was charming. It was like watching Iron Giant if he was a tree. Last of the main actors, Dave Bautista was pretty good with his role. He has really improve his acting chops. The villains were alright. Lee Pace was menacing, but his character was a bit one-dimensional villain type. Karen Gillan as Nebula is just plan hot. She was pretty good as the henchmen. Still, there were a few supporting actors were a bit disappointing like Michael Rooker as Yondu or John C. Reilly as Corpsman Rhomann Dey. I'm sorry, but I can't picture, Rooker as an alien with his redneck voice. Also, I can't picture Reilly as a starship trooper with his overweight body. There were a few scenes that I just couldn't picture, as well. The movie became a bit too unrealistic even for a Sci-Fiction with scenes like the heroes surviving dry-freeze temperance in deep space or them surviving large spaceship crashes. I just had to suspense my disbelief to get through them. Still, for the most part, the movie was indeed great. The humor was mostly hits, then misses. I love the 'over my head' joke. For a PG-13, the language is a bit harsh, there were a lot of frighten imagery, and extreme violent, but I think it's still alright for most children to watch it. The special and visual effect are pretty awesome. The action scenes are really stunning to the eyes. The 3D works, but it's not a must to see it in 3D. Watching it in 2D was good enough. The movie is also comic book Easter eggs nest that would make any comic nerd come to see the film and notice. Look for the cameos of horror director Lloyd Kaufman, musician Rob Zombie, and comic book writer, Stan Lee in the film, when watching. The whole collector (Benicio Del Toro) scene had enough to get fans talking for months as it has a lot of characters from previous films. The post-credit sequence was a bit disappointment, as it didn't really, promote 2015's The Avengers, the Age of Ultron nor any hint at any other oncoming Marvel film. It was a bit of a bad joke. Why did the movie had to remind me that Howard the Duck still around? At less, we know, for sure that a sequel to Guardians of the Galaxy will happen, one day. Overall: While, it's a good movie, it's not the best movie, I ever saw. It was indeed a pretty good popcorn film.

","Guardians of the Galaxy is unoriginal, insubstantial and most significantly, it's not funny. Once touted as their riskiest film to date, it is artistically and politically as conservative a film as Marvel Studios has ever made. The disappointment of the space adventure is that it is little more than a retread of a pedestrian formula, the numbingly predictable scaffolding of the comic book and superhero genre, hidden under the disguise of a broad comedy. The film's jokey banter, self-referential tone and pop culture references are smoke and mirrors used strategically to distract us from what is a threadbare narrative of unimaginative climaxes. When the film pauses briefly between action sequences lifted from Star Wars and the digital imagery of video games like Mass Effect it is to pursue an ideological viewpoint that doesn't inspire or rewrite the blockbuster but merely redecorates it. The film's values for family and nostalgia are not to be mistaken for depth or thematic goals but compulsory staples of Marvel's production line, the intention of which is to preserve the genre's wide commercial appeal while drastically limiting the variety of what mainstream Hollywood chooses to explore.

","In 1988 a young Peter Quill is by his dying mothers bedside, the last thing she wants to do before she passes on is give her child a final gift and say her goodbyes, but the emotion running through Peter is so strong and surreal his mother's dying wish to just hold his hand is never met. So as some kind of talisman the gift Peter receives is shoved into his backpack and never opened. Emotions run high as his mother's last breath leaves her body and young Peter runs out of the hospital and into an open field where he is suddenly beamed up and onto a spacecraft. Jump forward 26 years and a few galaxy's away and the young Peter Quill now known as Starlord as he likes to call himself is on an adventure of relic hunting, he picks up a strange orb which we discover is a treasure he has been commissioned to find and comes with a very lucrative reward attached. Starlord takes the orb back to the buyer who has offered the cash prize but once the buyer learns that Starlord was actually approached Ronan a madman who is intent on destroying the planet they stand on the deal is quickly shutdown and nothing is exchanged but a few awkward words. Starlord is then met by Gomora the assassin a stolen daughter of Thanos now working alongside Ronan who attempts to steal the orb away. Rocket a bounty hunter raccoon who can talk and who has been genetically modified to be a kind of gun tooting engineer and his bodyguard Groot a humanoid tree learn that Starlord has a bounty and attempt to go after it. Soon after the four characters are picked up and thrown into prison on an inescapable compound where the four meet Drax the destroyer a warrior who had his family slain by Ronan and wants nothing more than revenge. The five decide to team up and escape the prison to then go on and sell the orb to ""the collector"" a man who does exactly what his name states; he collects things. The group eventually learn that what lies within the orb can wipe out the universe and do whatever they can to ensure not Ronan nor Thanos the warlord Ronan works for do not get their hands on the orb. I cannot tell you how much I loved this film, I loved it from start to finish. I loved how it opened with such a powerful image and I loved how it ended with one much the same. It was funny, but not just funny ha-ha, it was hilarious, some of the dialogue was so natural in its delivery it all worked so well. The film never takes itself seriously unlike a few other films released it's just great fun. The CGI and visual effects are inspiring, the score is gorgeous and the 70's soundtrack worked so well with the entire film. There wasn't much you couldn't hate in this film. The characters were so real and believable (well as much as possible anyway) The cast were fabulous, I loved every one of them the standouts for me though were Ronan in my opinion one of the best bad guys to ever be given life! And Rocket, a Racoon with anger management issues is brilliant. Then of course Starlord who just holds everything together. Directed by James Gunn who is relatively an unknown he also helped write the script, I now believe he has a huge career ahead of him. Starting Chris Pratt as Peter Quill, Starlord, Zoe Saldana as Gomora, Bradley Cooper as the voice of Rocket, Vin Deisel as the voice of Groot, Dave Bautista as Drax, Lee Pace as Ronan, Michael Rooker as Yondu, Karen Gillan as Nebula and a handful of other quite well-known names made for an amazing cast. So now onto what I would have liked to see differently, the only thing I really hope they do is some origin films, nothing else, for once I didn't care there were no back stories on who these people were or where they actually came from but I would love to eventually see origin stories for each and every one of them.

This movie features a team of offbeat heroes that come together to utilize each others strengths and hide the weaknesses and is a very funny movie with good action as well.

There is no better character to champion this than the lovable living tree, Groot, who cannot communicate in any other way but a single repeated sentence. He's Chewbacca but animated with both facial expression and deadly danger in his stretching branchlike limbs, and so when he utters that line at the climax, we truly feel a part of the team as well. GOTG contains a mixed bag of characterisation, but it's done with eagerness and colour, so at the very least you cannot say they are boring or bland.

Plus when a film has a talking raccoon who shoots rockets how serious can it be? The cast was absolutely perfect. Chris Pratt is a star who has some of the best comedic timing in the business. Zoe Saldana is as BA as Scarlett Johansson is as Black Widow. Dave Bautista was a pleasant surprise as Drax for a wrestler turned actor.

These marvel films are becoming a huge bore and nevertheless have disappointed anyone even bothering to consider that maybe one day Hollywood will create a stellar film. But this?! This!? Garbage? Filled, to-the-lid with CGI! The typical stereotypes blown over proportions and yet people still go to these theaters and pay for this crap and still LIE to themselves and honestly say that it was a ""fantastic"" and ""great"" and ""awesome"" A film that would put a psychologist laughing maniacally in their leather armchair. The ""Ten out of Ten"" reviews are being given out like candy from these people. Were the characters bad? Yes. How many? Out of the guardians, it's obvious out of the five, there's Groot, the tree humanoid incapable of having a conversation, but don't worry it can understand what you're saying until of course, the record of the Idiot starts to play and Groot marches off and ruins your pitch perfect plan. He's the cgi character crutch. Crutch? How exactly? Simple when there's a break in the scene, here comes Groot and then we say...""okay Groot, perform your thing and then maybe even add a homage to the Hulk?"" Rocket Raccoon, what a mess isn't he? Both as a character and the fact that most of the emotion in this film came from the animated Raccoon. How many scenes will star him seething at the audience? As if his problems are towards everyone? What's even worse is the fact everyone is laughing at him in real life, there's no respect for him outside the film. Oh, and where's his real accent? Though I would have to say he's not the character that ruined the movie, what a surprised. In the fight of Man versus CGI, cgi wins in having a character outperform it's humanoid actors.

","Marvel Studios got smart with their Phase II films. The first phase was fun but I worried that I would reach a point of over-saturation where I might grow tired of their formula. Then they proved they had more tricks up their sleeve when they introduced the concept of incorporating other genres into the world of comic book films. THE WINTER SOLDIER was a political thriller and now GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY is a space adventure in the vein of the Star Wars films. When Marvel announced their Phase II series, I was the only one in my group of friends who got more excited for this film than the continuing adventures of Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America. No, I'd never heard of the Guardians before and that was probably what was most intriguing. It was something different. I immediately jumped on Wikipedia to get some idea as to what to expect and was quickly overwhelmed with the bizarre details of the characters and their cosmic adventures. I couldn't wait to see how it was handled on film. With the announcement of James Gunn as director, it solidified itself as my most anticipated film of 2014. In GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY, we're introduced to Peter Quill (Christ Pratt). Quill was abducted from Earth as a child and has since led the life of an interstellar outlaw, referring to himself as Star-Lord. His most recent acquisition is a mysterious orb of unknown power that draws the attention of an infamous Kree fanatic, Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace). Ronan has been tasked with retrieving the orb and presenting it to Thanos, the major villain Marvel has been teasing since the end of THE AVENGERS in 2012. Quill's adventures lands him in an unstable alliance with fellow outcasts in an effort to keep the orb from Ronan's hands: Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), Groot (Vin Diesel), and Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper).",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

The action is well throttled and not OTT. The perfection lies between the tangible chemistry between the main players and the razor sharp comedic script - it just works, trust me.

The excellent cinematography combined with a star-studded cast make this an engaging film that threads the line between explosions and emotional conflicts that will win your heart over, if Rocket's hilarious outbursts or Drax's literal personality havent done so already. My only gripes with the film come from odd holes in the plot such as Rocket and Groot going from wanting to turn Peter into the authorities for a handsome sum of units to risking their lives with him on a dangerous suicide mission or the sudden attitude change for the main characters as they go from wanting to kill each other to being ""best friends"".

","Based on a popular comic book from the Marvel Universe, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", a film directed and co-written by James Gunn, is a work quite different from what we are used to seeing in this genre. Firstly, due to the fact that, in this work, there are no ordinary people with super powers. The motivation of the characters, who are ordinary beings endowed with a strong willpower to accomplish something, within what they propose, is to unite for the protection of the planet and outer space galaxies against attacks and wars perpetrated by other enemy groups. . Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is a looter interested in the theft of various objects present in the many planets and galaxies in outer space. As a child, he was abducted from planet Earth after the death of his mother. For this very reason, he himself carries several relics - notably a walkman in which he plays cassette tapes of his mother's favorite songs. But, its object of interest during ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is a mysterious sphere that holds great power: the ability to endow those who come into contact with its nucleus with a super-common force that will be able to subdue and destroy any civilization that stands in your ways. Thus, after seeing himself as the target of a hunt whose interest is such a sphere, which is at the center of a dispute over the fate of the entire galaxy, Peter Quill joins those who will be the four other members of the group: Rocket, a sniper raccoon; Groot, a mutant tree; the intriguing Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Drax - The Destroyer (Dave Bautista), whose ultimate life goal is to avenge the death of his wife and daughter. ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is an interesting work, as it alternates dramatic moments, with some comical, romantic and pure action, in an attempt to attract a very heterogeneous audience. This makes the film somewhat unpredictable in the paths it takes, but at the same time, it leaves the work with a lack of cohesive axis, since the film's identity is never fully defined. The great success of director James Gunn here was the choice of Chris Pratt, an actor who has perfect comic timing and who lives up to expectations the first time he carries a film of this magnitude on his back.

","Marvel has a reputation for being the best of the best at summer blockbusters. This film is no exception. It's going to make A LOT of money. And for the first time in quite a few years, a Marvel film actually deserves it. Following Peter Quill or Star Lord played by Chris Pratt. The not so notorious outlaw. As he is sent to retrieve a odd orb from a desolate planet. Turns out quite a few others are also after the orb. This leads to the meeting of the other guardians of the galaxy. Rocket played by Bradly cooper a genetically modified raccoon meant to be comedy relief , Gamora Zoe Saldana a vicious warrior, Drax Dave Bautista a deranged killer, and Groot Vin Diesel a practically invisible tree. The visuals are unmatched just like any marvel movie. As they should be since 2 of the leads are completely CGI. Besides the jaw dropping visuals the characters here are equally well done. We learn deep and engaging things about each one which will make you fall in love with them. Usually a film with this many main characters some are forgotten or the bonds between them and the others are thin. But Gaurdians does a brilliant job of developing strong bonds between each character individually. While the leads are extremely well done the villain is once again forgotten. Marvel has a tough time making a villain that is unforgettable. While Locke is the closest they've gotten its just not enough. Ronan played by Lee pace was under done. Although he had more motive then most of marvels villains he is still quite forgettable. Another forgettable aspect is the story. All though intriguing and mysterious. It is quite predictable right from the start. The orb that everyone is after seems stupid and useless. But you cant help but think of why everyone wants it. Once you figure out what is and does THEN the story falls prey to Marvels usual ridiculousness and predictability. Even tho the over the top ending feels more coherent then any other Marvel flick.

Then in the middle of the movie the superhero is using his/her powers to either test them out or to fight a bad guy (mostly for losing so that it can pay off in the end).

","Director/co-writer James Gunn manages to deftly blend witty humor, rousing action, touching drama, and full-tilt go-for-broke imaginative fantasy into one hell of an infectiously enjoyable cinematic cocktail that not only delivers on the dazzling grand scale spectacle, but also has plenty of moving human (and alien) moments amid all the fancy CGI pyrotechnics. What makes this film so special and appealing is the tremendous feeling of loyalty and camaraderie amongst the colorful and likable misfit protagonists: They're a scrappy ragtag bunch who initially don't seem that decent or heroic, but in the long run prove they got the right courageous stuff to qualify as true guardians of the galaxy. Chris Pratt makes for an engaging and charismatic lead. Zoe Saldana likewise shines as one tough and formidable gal. Dave Baustita provides loads of brawny charm as the vengeful Drax. Vin Diesel's throaty rumble fits perfectly for gentle giant sentient tree Groot (""I am Groot""). Michael Rooker has an absolute ball as the fearsome leader of a gang of interstellar pirates. Moreover, such familiar faces as Glenn Close, John C. Reilly, Bernicio Del Toro, and Gregg Henry acquit themselves well in neat secondary roles. Stan Lee and Lloyd Kaufman pop up in amusing cameos. However, it's Bradley Cooper's exemplary vocal work as the resourceful and quick-thinking raccoon Rocket who almost steals the whole show; Cooper projects both a fierce sense of sharp sarcastic humor and a genuinely surprising vulnerability as this lovable mutant rodent. Alas, Lee Pace's petulant Ronan rates as a rather blah central villain, but fortunately Karen Gillian as the bitter Nebula compensates for this. The choice soundtrack of 70's rock gems and a wealth of inspired pop culture references -- love that Howard the Duck cameo at the very end! -- add immensely to the overall irresistibly spirited merriment.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

Like Ultimate Warrior on a rant. Only good acting came from Thanos and Rocket. Yep, the CGIs. The final battle was whack. The ships lined up to form a net to stop the super ship and the good guy ships were below shooting bad guy ships who we're dive bombing the city. The worst was when they tried to replicate that scene in Avengers when Hulk was slamming Loki around but instead it was Groot shooting his tendrils through a bunch of bad guys and skewering them then slamming them unnecessarily back and forth against walls. The ending was so cheesy when John C Reiley was all sappy about his wife and kid being saved who they showed in the end as a woman and her daughter who earlier was part of a scene where they were almost crushed.

","On the same night his mother dies a young boy named ""Peter Quill"" (Chris Pratt) is abducted by an alien UFO. Several years later he becomes a thief working for an alien by the name of ""Yondu Udonta"" (Michael Rooker). However, when he steals a valuable piece of merchandise known as an ""infinity stone"" that Yondu had his sights set on he soon finds that he has a price put on his head. But bounty hunters aren't the only ones looking for him as a savage warlord also wants the infinity stone and sends a beautiful assassin named ""Gamora"" (Zoe Saldana) to bring it to him. Anyway, rather than reveal any more of the movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it, I will just say that fans of CGI and action will probably love this particular picture as it has lots of both. Unfortunately, other than perhaps the presence of the aforementioned Michael Rooker and Zoe Saldana, I honestly didn't consider this movie to be as good as the marketing and hype surrounding it.

This launched Guardians Of The Galaxy into household names. I recently revisited this film and it's just as good on the second viewing. It's a funny, action packed thrill ride from beginning to end with arguably the best movie soundtrack of all time. This film is masterfully done and has us not only connect with the characters in a few hours, but really feel like they're family by the end; which is really hard to do in the limited time of a film.

","Call me lost in space for taking an eternity to experience the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", but I finally launched into it and it was worth the ride. The blockbuster stars Chris Pratt as a charismatic intergalactic criminal named Peter Quill who also goes by StarLord. Peter himself was abducted as a child by a clan of intergalactic criminals just after his mom passed away. His national treasure has always been a walkman with a cassette of some classic tunes, which was one of the classic aspects of the movie. Through unexpected circumstances, Quill teams up with other intergalactic bad guys that are really good; including the green gal Gamora (Zoe Saldana), the vengeful prisoner Drax (Dave Bautista), the sarcastic loudmouthed raccoon Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), and the one-phrase tree Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). Sure, they are a diverse bunch but their mission to stop madman Ronan's Run to control the universe was quite imperative. Director James Gunn sure had some fun developing this one, and he did a commendable job, even though there were one too many action sequences. Where Gunn hit right on target was on the witty screenplay he scribed with Nicole Perlman. What I thought was really a blast off about ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" was the zany, pitch-perfect vocal performance from Bradley Cooper as Rocket. His Rocket launched vocal greatness, even though Rocket was off his rocker. OK, my pun mission is done here.

","Guardians of the Galaxy plays out like Star Wars on crack, its fast, ferocious and a badass entertaining thrill ride throughout. Following a rag tag group of intergalactic criminals, Guardians has the plot line of a Star Wars film, the characters of a Dirty Harry film and the action of every Marvel movie combined. What makes this film stand out from the rest of the Marvel films is that it engages you knowing that you have absolutely no idea who or what the hell this is. It does a great job filling you in with information from the comic and it makes for an enjoyable watch. Unlike the fans of the comic, I had no knowledge of Guardians of the Galaxy and walking out of it, it really educates you on anything you may have missed out on all while giving proper character growth and development without heavily relying on the comic books as ""common knowledge"". Chris Pratt is awesome in this film, he reminds me a lot of Indiana Jones in space. He's a wise cracking, ass kicking criminal that can beat with his words or his fists (more times than not, its his fists). Dave Batista, Zoe Saldana, Michael Rooker, Vin Diesel, and Bradley Cooper along with Pratt gives Guardians of the Galaxy a better cast than Avengers. The film comes at you like a bullet train thats about to derail, you're always engaged with these characters despite most of them being an alien, a talking tree or a talking raccoon. The film is really amazing in that you look at these characters and the ridiculousness of the situation and still don't even question it. Now there are some plot holes that will more than likely be cleared up the Marvel way, meaning down the line something will happen to patch up a couple holes here and there. While that may prove to be lazy writing, I think Marvel films have now earned the right to do whatever the hell they want. Guardians of the Galaxy is a great comic book film and this is coming from someone who was so apprehensive about seeing this film that I almost didn't go. This is a surprising, entertaining, gut busting thrill ride that is impossible to disappoint especially to fans of the Marvel universe and franchises. But even if a superhero movie isn't your thing, I'm confident enough to say that you'll have a great time seeing this movie.

275,10 August 2014,lostflix,2," We left the theater. It was that bad. (Spoilers)
","The first five minutes of Guardians of the Galaxy is a hook and gets your teeth sunk in for what looks like a fun, creative, and quirky ride. Then after 10-15 minutes went by I couldn't help but feel I've seen this EXACT movie before. I had. It was a film entitled Raiders of the Lost Ark. You may of heard of it. If you were to watch the first 10 minutes of each of these films and overlay them you would pretty much be watching the same film. So they updated it with a LOT of CGI and super heroes because super heroes are the current trend right now. Of course pepper in a cameo with Stan Lee right? The movie gets worst from there on out. The CGI is over the top, the characters are thrown at us with no development at all but with the assumption we are to care about them. One minute they are trying to kill each other (or not kill each other for some reason... why put him in a bag? I don't get it. Just take the orb). Then about 60 minutes in the producers decide to blast us with a 20-30 minute CGI jack fest that looks just like another film. This time they decided to duplicate Star Wars Episode II (not a good film to replicate). A space chase with CGI only Lucas could love. Ten million things happening on the screen in the span of one chase scene all while blasting our eyes and our ears with brutally piercing effects. Your ears will be ringing for 48hrs after seeing this film. You might have an epileptic seizure if you try to follow all the action as well. This leaves us a little later on with Peter Quill mysteriously smitten over a girl that he has no connection with that has been established. Matter of fact he decides to risk his own life to save her and depend on the undesirable to save him. Sure. Cue more CGI and miraculous healing a minute later to his face.... after all he isn't mortal is he? Or is he? There is also a tree in the film that walks and conveniently regenerates limbs when handcuffs are needed to be placed on him. They have a prison suit that fits a 2' tall raccoon (who doesn't know what a raccoon is even though he speaks English) but not a prison suit that fits a 8' tree. I think this was a case of the CGI department having no problem rendering walking branches instead of a walking rodent. The tree has a case of the Hodors but not unlike Chewbacca he can be completely understood as he speaks articulated sentences. Except with Chewbacca we could infer Solo was guesstimating what Chewy was saying and having fun with it. This is not the case. The raccoon actually understands everything. The film got so bad that we saw a few people get up and leave about 90 minutes into it. We took their cue ten minutes later (the person I was with kept looking at me like... really??) and left as well. The film was an obnoxious capitalistic CGI jack fest that had no story (that wasn't stolen from three other high grossing films), no character development, and no creativity. To give you an example of how uncreative it is, after ripping off the entire intro to Raiders of the Lost Ark the director (I assume) tried to pull a song from the Reservoir Dogs soundtrack and use it to lighten the film. In this case ""Hooked on a Feeling"" was used. When? When the characters were entering prison of course, why of course they were hooked on the feeling of going to prison. Contrast this with the brilliant work of Tarantino's use of the same song in Reservoir Dogs. It's like the director never saw Reservoir Dogs or he had no say in the music used in the film. What happened to the clever 70s music to be sprinkled in for comic relief? It just disappeared midway thru the film and didn't return til later. They had to have the Episode II CGI jack fest scene to take up half the movie and the pretend romance scene. I could go on from there about how bad this movie was but I would have to go back and watch the last thirty minutes. Maybe after my ears stop ringing and they release the fifth special edition DVD (at which point 99 cents will be the going rate for all other versions) I might just do that. Until then I'll cross my fingers and hope JJ can save the Holy Trilogy that this film and so many others try to rip off while turning a blind eye. It's no coincidence that the poster looks exactly like the poster for Episode IV.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

","I love Marvel. Whether it be X-Men, Thor, The Avengers, Spider-man, Iron Man... most of the commonly known ones, of course, but I always loved them. But to put this as simply as I can -though that doesn't mean this will be short-, this film was filled with 1,000 of the most common clichés extracted from these great films and stories and crammed them into one mashed-up, jumpy, unreserved, ridiculous, abnormal, spiteful, detestable, idiotic, moronic, absurd, ludicrous, senseless, meaningless, pointless, terribly-written, unbelievably- unrealistic, super-super-super-hero-wannabe movie that very desperately AND obviously AND obnoxiously attempts to special-effect everything -and I mean everything- to simply gain some big bucks because, hey, it's Marvel, what could go wrong? It's sad to see how successful their attempts were; I fell for it... for me, it's all due to The Avengers because that was freaking amazing, even though it had a lot of commonplace stuff. And boy, do I regret wasting my two hours on this extremely disappointing collage. Basically, it's a film made of collages because everything just had to be colorful in outer space. No seriously. Of course everything is colorful there. It's not like the galaxy is filled with 96% dark matter that is called DARK for a reason. So yeah. Totally makes sense. And your skin also starts rotting in outer-space, too. Serious case of leprosy then? I liked Elektra more than this. I'd rather have watched that five times. Kind of feel like that says something. The only reasons I smiled or laughed was because the directors and script writers were decent at making corny jokes, puns, and lines funny enough that giggling is impossible prevent unless you are emotionless. They should have gone with comedy, rather than action-adventure, though, since I sincerely thought the rest of the moments were just junk. Call me a spoil-sport if you must, but I was literally whispering what would happen in the next minute to my friend beside me. Usually I'm not very good at predicting what happens in films -unless they are seriously full of clichés...which this film is-, but I said them anyway. I was right 8 times. Out of 9. I counted. Anyway... though the beautiful graphics did rival that of Avatar, the plot of ""saving the people from the evil mastermind only this time it involves the whole galaxy instead of just one planet so it's not just Earth that's being targeted this time so ha we are different"" never got THIS tiring. I was so close to sinking in my chair and dreaming up a nightmare because of how stupidly predictable this film was. Maybe that was intentional and Marvel fans just wanted to see some new, more unique heroes this time, and also to see the visuals, and maybe to see Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana's pretty butts...but whatever. I had half that mind prepared for a cliché-turned- awesome movie when I walked in the theater.

","Who would have thought that Marvel's next highly entertaining, multi-million (hopeful billion) dollar cinematic adventure would be set in a futuristic space world, whose tonal and narrative flow is shaped around a retro-filled soundtrack with songs dating from the 1960's to 1980's? With hits including Blue Swede's Hooked On a Feeling, The Runaway's Cherry Bomb, The Jackson 5's I Want You Back and Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell's Ain't No Mountain High Enough, Marvel Studios Guardians of the Galaxy is the epitome of silly, mindless fun at the movies. I'm not sure what Marvel Studios obsession with Marvin Gaye may be currently, but after having the song Trouble Man dictate the narrative for the highly impressive Captain America: The Winter Soldier earlier this year, it seems that the powerhouse studio is repossessing old concepts and ideas, and polishing them up quite nicely. With a bit of frantic, highly busy visual effects as well as engrossing dark physical and illicit family comedy, and presenting them in exuberantly exciting fashion for people of all ages to enjoy, Guardians of the Galaxy is a clear-cut winner.

The cast includes a handful pretty famous names, but it was especially a breakthrough for Chris Pratt, who was probably only known to fans of ""Parks & Recreation"" before. The story is a bit similar to ""Despicable Me"" as we have a criminal here as well who changes sides. Actually, it is not just one criminal, but a whole bunch.

","I'm coming late to The Guardians of the Galaxy party, but boy am I glad I finally made it. What an absolutely blast of a movie. I had so much fun with this one. Everything works. The special effects are amazing. There was a time when CGI characters looked dark and not terribly convincing. How far has technology come? The action is non-stop with plenty of explosions, fight scenes, and other general craziness. It's a well-paced thrill ride that rarely slows for a breath. That's not to say there's not a story here, because there is. Guardians of the Galaxy does as much to advance the larger MCU plot line as any film Marvel has put out. As with the other Marvel movies, Guardians of the Galaxy features a lot of funny bits. The comedy never felt forced (thankfully). Instead, it has that organic feel to it that all good comedy has. The acting is another high spot. Chris Pratt is tremendous in the lead. I can't say enough about how good he is. Underneath all that green make-up, Zoe Saldana gives a fantastic, multi-layered performance (Did I really just wrote that?). But my favorite has to be Dave Bautista as Drax. When I first read he was being cast in a large role, I was worried. His acting really surprised me. He plays Drax like an actor with years of experience. His deadpan delivery was perfect. Very nice job all the way around. I'm going to give this one a very, very strong 8/10 - and I predict I'll raise that after I watch it again.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

First and foremost, I must say that Zoe Saldana knows her aliens. After blockbuster Avatar and other successful movies like Star Trek she takes upon yet again another alien role in Guardians of the Galaxy and of course it works. Cris Pratt is really good as Peter, not too serious and not too heroic that works along with the other comic figures. Couldn't help but feel that Peter had some Star Trek resemblance, but other than that, the movie follows the star wars sci fi model only with the major final battle action scene. The humor and the odd music work here to set the film of the beaten track and create a hit that most possibly, as the credits in the end suggested, will have a sequel.

","I seem to be the only one that found this movie to childish, i think that it was a real big shame that they tried to make the movie so that children were allowed to watch it. For example, not a single human dies during the movie, Starlord just uses his electric shock thing when he fires at humans. And the movie was to ""un-serious"", there were jokes every minute which made it impossible to watch the movie at the cinema because everyone just laughed like hell when there was a small joke that actually wasn't funny at all, well some jokes were a little funny but none of them made me laugh. I may sound like a horrible person for doing this but the only time i laughed was at the beginning of the movie when (SPOILER ALERT) starlord's mom was lying sick in the hospital, me and my friend started laughing uncontrollably and i don't even know why. I guess that we started laughing because we knew that you aren't supposed to laugh to those things. Everyone stared at us... Anyways the movie also had lots of predictibale moments and some parts of it was a little clichè, (POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT) and the end battle that they made you look forward to was the most anti climax end to a movie i have ever seen, they killed the main villain so quick. Overall the effects and animated things in the movie were extremely good, the setting was good, the jokes were al little entertaining but there were way too many jokes in the movie and there was a lack of death and gore, the the movie was way too short and the characters didn't have time to develop, and the plot was way to predictable and cliché. You didn't see any blood or gore during the movie at all which made the movie way to comedic. I would prefer the movie to be more serious and ""grown up"". I would give it 6/10 but that is for people over 11 y.o, for a child this movie would be perfect, from the perspective of a child i would have given it 9.5/10. And if they had made it less childish i would switch the scores so that it was 9.5/10 for people over 11 and 6/10 for children. I hope that the sequel will be more grown up.

They wanted Quill to give out like a player vibe ( not a douchebag ) , the tree a loving vibe , the raccoon a silly but cool vibe , the girl an assassin but loving vibe , and finally the rock looking guy, a man who wants to avenge his family. They managed to do this very well , but in the middle of the story it felt like they wanted to change the aspect of the characters , which made me feel less about them. And they kept giving an illusion that the characters had died when they never did ( to many times ). This makes the movie come of as not being ballsy and to unrealistic ( more of a kid movie ). The vfx and the makeup was amazing , the story was fine , the actors where great. but they failed making me people care about the characters.

","Among the best superhero films ever made, James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy is easily the directors best work, as well as the best film in the MCU so far. The soundtrack of this film is amazing, not only giving us an ample track of catchy tunes, but providing the film with a style and atmosphere most directors can't even dream of achieving on screen. The sheer charisma and energy from this film is unmatchable, and the cast is absolutely perfect as a result. The script is brilliant and well written, and the special effects never feel too forced, and are in fact some of the best the MCU has had to offer. It's also a lot bigger than films in the past, it may not be as visually stimulating, but it opens the world of Marvel to so many new possibilities- it's impossible to not be impressed. It's without a doubt that this film is entertaining, hilarious, and incredibly fun to watch- but it also has an incredible amount of heart as well- and truly is able to satisfy nearly every emotion as every great movie hopes to achieve. In the end, Guardians of the Galaxy is the ultimate underdog blockbuster- and I love every minute of it.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

While The Avengers was a jolly good (if throwaway) time, their movies aren't always as satisfying. Outside of the first Iron Man film, there's little else that sufficiently ticks enough boxes. Even at their most acclaimed with this year's Captain America followup The Winter Soldier it didn't break their mould of bad habits with misjudged melodrama, clunky humour, contrivances and dull villains. Now comes the seed of a new franchise, one admittedly more risky than the others that had brand awareness even for those who never read comic books.

","Guardians of the Galaxy (2014): Dir: James Gunn / Cast: Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista / Voices: Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper: Creative and imaginative comic book fantasy about putting aside differences and uniting for the better good. Plot doesn't matter for it is just a series of spectacular action scenes in their most senseless manner. Chris Pratt plays Star Lord whose mother died when he was a boy then he is sucked into space. He grows to appreciate old music and just plainly tick off anyone within reach. Zoe Saldana plays a green skin woman who would be the envy of Captain Kirk. She flees the enemy in hopes of turning the tables. That would involve an orb that can blow them into orbit if they open it. Dave Bautista plays an inmate whom Pratt and Saldana meet in prison and he wants to avenge the death of his family. He initially targets Saldana since it is practically her blood but he will learn to form an alliance. Vin Diesel voices a tree creature of few words but constant surprise and pleasantness. His name is Groot and that is stated throughout the film. He also has the greatest climatic payoff in the film. Bradley Cooper voices Rocket Raccoon whose negative attitude shelters manic energy and resources. Director James Gunn is accompanied with a flimsy screenplay that pays off with hilarious dialogue and a constant array of special effects that bring life to a variety of odd characters.

","I think that I am going to start this review by saying that I cannot believe that the writer/director of a stinker film like Movie 43 actually also had a hand in writing and directed this film. James Gunn has completely redeemed himself, because Movie 43 was one of the worse films I have ever seen. Guardians of the Galaxy had a great story line and the acting was comical with non-stop action. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is a galaxy scavenger (thief) who goes around collecting stuff that other people have commissioned him to acquire. That being said, he acquires an orb that apparently is very valuable to a lot of people. This sets up the film and the adventure begins. Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and his sidekick Groot (Vin Diesel) are some sort of bounty hunters and soon discovers that someone will pay a lot of money to bring in Peter (and his orb). During the film, the only words that Groot knows how to say are ""I am Groot"", but somehow Rocket has learned to understand him by his inflection rather than his words. This makes for a very endearing relationship. Gamora (Zoe Saldana) volunteers to get the orb from Peter and the evil Ronan (Lee Pace) agrees to let her go. The initial scene when all of these characters finally encounter one another was very funny and you kind of get to see what all of them are capable of (as far as fighting ability goes). Drax (Dave Bautista) joins the group shortly after the initial meeting. At first Drax is very self-absorbed and really has his own agenda (pretty much like everyone else), but soon comes to realize that the more the merrier (or whatever). The making of the sequel is already scheduled for 2017. I imagine that we will find out who Peter's father was because that is really the only cliff hanger in this film. Stan Lee made his usual cameo appearance as an elderly playboy (really?). Hell, I guess when you own so many characters you have the right to be whoever the heck you want to be. I recently downloaded an app called ""Run Pee"" which tells you when the best time to go to the restroom is during a movie. The app said there is no good time for this film.

Pratt: Like 3 Seconds ago!!!. Bautista: I wasn't listening I was thinking of something else. Bradley Cooper and Zoe Saldana round out the Guardians and the last of the decent performances. The supporting cast is not strong with weak performances from Lee Pace as the Kree villain Ronan the accuser, Karen Gillian as his henchwoman Nebula, And John C.

481,24 April 2020,DrTuvok,2," Imagine what it's like before watching. That's exactly what it's like
","This movie is oddly overrated even by Marvel movie standards. It garnered all this acclaim, was praised as 'Star Wars for this century' by some, and was even included in the 1001 Movies to Watch before You Die book. (Why not include the Fifth Element if this type of thing is going in too?).
Sorry, but this doesn't come equal with Star Wars or Star Trek. It doesn't have the complex world-building or imagination of Star Trek. (Even Serenity was better than this). Star Wars, at least the first six movies, had a very strong story with archetypical fantasy characters that were written well enough. GOTG has a bunch of assassins and thugs who don't really develop except for learning to work together; a predictable story trope that anyone could write and which was in one too many superhero movies even at the time. The story is lame, another 'get the Macguffin' plot line that would later be recycled in future Avengers movies. (With the same Macguffin, no less, and the same use of the Macguffin to kill the bad guys). Watch them team up to get the Macguffin! Then see them use it to blow up their enemies! There, I summarized what is literally the entire storyline.
There are a couple of good quirks in here though...the incorporation of 70s music was a nice change and Chris Pratt sold the childish potty humor around half the time. There are a couple of good jokes sprinkled in here too, but good luck remembering them once the post-credit scene is over.
The directing is flat and similar to any other Marvel movie you've seen before. You can easily tell that Disney hired a squad of second-unit directors to shoot all the action scenes for the blockbuster-inexperienced director James Gunn, because these parts feel exactly the same as all the other Marvel films. (They probably all have the same second-unit team for actions scenes). There's nothing visionary here. It's a pretty juvenile ordeal which doesn't deserve to be called a space opera.
Why Gunn is hailed as a new visionary director is beyond me, as is why everybody made such a big stink when he got fired for perverted tweets. Any director could do this sort of thing if they wanted to: add in your favorite 70s mix as a soundtrack, fill the script with profanity and bodily functions jokes, and then lay back and let the CGI do all the work. It's interesting that so many people are eager to forgive Gunn, when many of those same people rant on about what a rotten person Mel Gibson is, even though Gibson is a miles better director with a much firmer grasp on storytelling.

","Marvel has hit the ball again out the park with another great hit adding to the line of the successful films in their current cinematic run. Guardians of The Galaxy is different, fresh, and a brand new take on the superhero genre. It focuses on a team of misfits who would have to set aside their own differences to save the galaxy, and I know this plot may sound generic but with the amazing story and the nice touch of humour throughout it's a guaranteed fun ride all the way. One of the best characters to look out for is Bradley Cooper as Rocket, a raccoon with a dangerous attitude. Even Chris Pratt who plays Star-Lord gave a surprisingly great performance. All around this film is excellent and if your a Marvel fan bonus as there is tons of Easter Eggs and a certain galactic titan that makes a surprise appearance in the middle.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

I thought that there should've been more Thanos in the movie than there was and I wanted to see more of the villain, Ronin. The characters were very likable, my favorite was Rocket Raccoon. I thought having Howard the Duck in the film was very strange because he's not really a Marvel character. Stan Lee's cameo was funny as usual. If you do go see this film then I would recommend the 3D version over the 2D because the visuals are fantastic and worth the extra ticket price.

With films nowadays, I always feel that perhaps they had too much story and less action or visa versa. But this had the perfect balance which made it that much more better. I can honestly say that this is probably the best, if not, one of the best films of the year so far - the rating just confirms how amazing it is. This is one of the highest rated films!

This movie actually give all the main character in the crew to shine, which just doesn't applies to a lot of movies of this sort *cough* ""The Expendables"". So when it comes down to it the build up of the main team and how they get together and become a team is done well and I actually was interested in all the members of the crew, especially when it came to Rocket and Peter Quill. The action sequences are done well, nothing that I found to be groundbreaking, but it didn't seem mindless like ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"".

","""Super"" writer & director James Gunn took moviegoers for an irreverent, interplanetary joyride, peppered with pop culture references, in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" back in 2014. Happily, Gunn's sequel ""Guardians of the Galaxy, Volume 2"" qualifies as just as impressive with several surprises. If you haven't seen ""GoTG, Vol. 1,"" then you may have problems putting both the swashbuckling characters and their outlandish backstory into context in this imaginative, science-fiction, follow-up saga. Good sequels always dig deeper into the original characters and conjure up newcomers. ""GoTG, Vol. 2"" reassembles the same quintet and scrutinizes them in greater detail. Peter Quill, ostensibly the Guardians' leader, catches up with his enigmatic sire, Ego, and father and son surprise each other with their goals during the second act. We learn that Ego has been searching the universe for his long, lost son. Later, Yondu observes astutely about the grandiose Ego: ""He may have been your father, Quill, but he wasn't your daddy."" This father and son connection yields the ultimate surprise, too, but discretion prevents me from divulging specifics. The peculiar relationship that Quill has forged with Yondu Udonta, the extraterrestrial space pirate who abducted Quill from Earth after the lad fled from the hospital where his cancer-stricken mom died takes on an added dimension. No character changes as much in ""GoTG 2"" as Yondu. He evolves from a villain to an honorable individual. Meanwhile, sibling rivalry keeps Quill's quasi-girlfriend Gamora locked into a feud with her jealous sister Nebula. Nebula hates Gamora with a passion because their evil stepfather Thanos preferred Gamora over her. Smutty-mouthed Rocket Raccoon remains as obnoxious as ever, but his bad-tempered attitude thaws during the third act. Good sequels send off the characters onto exciting new adventures against different villains. The Guardians are summoned to a remote corner of the cosmos again. The new aliens—the Sovereigns—constitute a petulant people with little sense of humor. When Rocket infuriates them, the latter pursue the Guardians with a vengeance until greater powers interfere.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

A fight ensues between them, and grabs the attention of two bounty hunters, genetically engineered raccoon Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and tree-like humanoid Groot (Vin Diesel), and the four of them end up arrested by the Nova Corps and imprisoned in maximum security artificial moon the Kyln. In the prison the four of them stick together, and are soon joined with powerful inmate Drax (Spectre's Dave Bautista) who wants revenge for the death of his family at the hands of Ronan, Gamora reveals that she betrayed Ronan as he wants to use the orb's power to destroy entire planets including Xandar, Ronan meanwhile meets titan Thanos (Josh Brolin) to discuss Gamora's betrayal and the loss of the orb. Accompanied by Drax, Quill, Gamora, Rocket and Groot escape the Kiln and flee to remote criminal outpost Nowhere, the group meets Gamora's contact Taneleer Tivan aka The Collector (Benicio Del Toro) who opens the orb, inside it is an Infinity Stone that has immeasurable power to destroy all but powerful beings who can wield it, this is proved when Tivan's assistant grabs it that engulfs him in an explosion. Drunken Drax summons Ronan, he is easily defeated while the others flee, pursued by Ronan's followers and Gamora's sister Nebula (Doctor Who's Karen Gillan), she manages to destroy her ship and captures the sphere, Gamora and Quill floating in space are collected eventually by Yondu, Quill negotiates a truce with him. Quill, Gamora, Rocket, Groot and surviving Drax agree that facing Ronan means certain death, but they must stop him from using the Infinity Stone to destroy the galaxy, Ronan meanwhile embeds the Stone in his warhammer and threatens to kill Thanos. On Xandar, Ronan's ship the Dark Aster is confronted by Yondu's fleet, the Nova Corps, and Quill's group who manage to breach, Korath is killed by Drax, Gamora defeats Nebula, who escapes, and Rocket damages the enemy ship to crash with Groot sacrificing himself to shield the others. Ronan emerges from the wreck and prepares to destroy Xandar, but Quill distracts him while Drax and Rocket destroy the warhammer, Quill grabs the Infinity Stone, and finds that he, Gamora, Rocket and Drax are powerful enough to withstand its force, and they use the power to destroy Ronan. In the end Yondu is given a false orb, while the real one containing the Stone is given to the Nova Corps, the group now called the Guardians of the Galaxy all have their criminal records expunged, Quill finds out he is only half-human, his father was part an ancient unknown species, and he finds the courage to open the last present from his dying mother, the Guardians leave in their repaired ship, the Milano, and Groot seen regrowing in his plant pot. Also starring John C. Reilly as Corpsman Dey, Glenn Close as Nova Prime, The Inbetweeners Movie's Laura Haddock as Meredith Quill, Peter Serafinowicz as Denarian Saal, Stan Lee as Xandarian Ladies' Man, Slither's Nathan Fillion as Monstrous Inmate, Rob Zombie as Ravager Navigator and Seth Green as Howard the Duck in an amusing post credits sequence. Pratt is likable as the wisecracking hero with his ""Awesome Mix"" cassette tapes, Saldana is cool as the green-skinned warrior, Cooper does almost steal the show as the fuzzy fast-talking sidekick with Diesel suitably voicing his walking tree partner who can only say ""I am Groot"", and Pace and Gillan get their moments as the villains. It is an engaging movie with the heroes of the piece try to stop the power-hungry aliens achieving galactic domination, the high octane chase and fight sequences are impressive, and the CGI and makeup special effects creating the spaceships, creatures and imaginative space spectacle is brilliant. The soundtrack with ""awesome"" songs like ""I'm Not in Love"" - 10cc, ""Escape (The Piña Colada Song)"" - Rupert Holmes, ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" - Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell and ""I Want You Back"" - The Jackson 5 is a nice touch as well, it is a fantastically fun science-fiction action adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Make Up & Hair, and Best Special Visual Effects.

","With a group of heroes consisting of a raccoon, a tree, a green-skinned assassin, a red- tattooed warrior and a man stuck squarely in the 80's, GotG was always going to be the weirdest entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That it's now up there with The Avengers as Marvel's best is testament to director James Gunn's vision, execution and utterly perfect casting. After a backstory-building scene with a young Peter Quill we jump ahead 20 years to witness Quill, aka Star Lord (Chris Pratt – a superstar in the making), in a dank cave dancing around to Redbone's 1974 hit ""Come and Get Your Love"", and the movie never looks back. It's not long before we meet the show-stealing Rocket Raccoon (voiced to perfection by Bradley Cooper), a cocky, smart-arsed bounty hunter with a penchant for bombs and machine guns, and his bodyguard Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel), a regenerating tree-like creature whose vocabulary consists only of ""I am Groot"". Throw in Zoe Saldana's sexy but badass Gamora, adopted daughter of genocidal maniac Thanos who is searching for redemption, and Dave Bautista's grief-stricken man mountain Drax, whose race of people take everything literally, and you have a ragtag bunch ready to save the galaxy from Lee Pace's indefatigable revenge- seeker (and awesome looking) Ronan the Accuser.

","Somehow, the hype train didn't roll straight over this one. It's just as good as advertised. With so many chiseled jaws and grim, determined brows crowding the superhero scene over the last ten years, I think we really needed a film like this to remind us of how much great, loose fun the genre can still be. In fact, even calling it a superhero movie may be something of a stretch - it spans a number of different classes, plucking fitting elements from each and packing them down into a beautifully odd, curious, colorful bouquet. It's as much Star Wars or Indiana Jones as it is Thor, a glowing hunk of sci-fi and adventure with no taste for restraint and a ticklish funny bone that really sets it apart. Having read comics for most of my life, I know how uncommon it is to see a filmed adaptation that even nears the kind of boundless imagination possible on the printed page. In this, too, Guardians of the Galaxy is a gust of fresh air - at all times, the screen brims with rich detail, superior dashes of inconsequential world-building and oodles of hints and winks. It's as close as I think Hollywood has ever come to flashing the sense of joy and wonder inherent in that medium to a broader audience, a real treat to drink in and enjoy. I can't help but admire the balls it took to go this far into left field, to create something so wholly different from the present status quo. Admire, that is, and appreciate.

","With the end of summer blockbuster season approaching, Marvel have managed to drop in yet another action-packed comic book thrill ride. The product here is a cinematic adaptation of 'Guardians of The Galaxy'. While the comic book series never made a household name like many notable entries such as 'X-Men' or 'Spiderman', Marvel Studios has proved more than worthy of making an entertaining hit out of lesser known heroes. This is where director James Gunn comes in. Sporting a highly likable cast of Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, and Dave Bautista; this superhero actioner flourishes a hodgepodge of tense, special effects-heavy action set pieces and clever humor in efforts to pull audiences into fun, hyperkinetic thrill ride. And by many means, it's a whole lot of fun. Set in the distant future, this film follows Peter Quill a.k.a. Star Lord (played by Chris Pratt), a hot-headed space explorer who finds himself in deep conflict with an evil mastermind Ronan (played by Lee Pace) when he steals a magical artifact. Crashing landing on Planet Xander, Peter forms an unexpected alliance with quartet of mercenaries including a talking, gun-totting raccoon named Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), green-skinned alien Gamora (played by Zoe Saldana), a tree-like humanoid Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel), and a revenge-hungry gray monster known as Drax the Destroyer (played by Dave Bautista).

","James Gunn was about the last person I'd expect to helm a Marvel film. His gory comedy Slither and the barely noticed Super were vulgar and anarchic pieces of anti-good taste and Slither is entirely successful all the more for it. For the first hour of Guardians of the Galaxy, it seemed like Gunn broke through the impenetrable micro managing force that is Marvel Studios. His directing voice is present, some of his goofy trademarks are there, some of his usual roster of actors show up and it remarkably doesn't feel like a piece of committee filmmaking. The vfx sequences seemed designed with a vision and as we are introduced to new worlds and characters it's a blast to watch a film where you're never sure where it goes or who or what you will meet along the way. Our group of odd balls, led by Chris Pratt are all cast well and even more amazingly Rocket and Groot don't feel like characters designed to sell toys. So it's a damn shame the last hour or so, the narrative stops dead in its tracks and treads water - serving us been there, done that action, character growth that feels forced and too much focus on a lame villain. Guardians feels like a third of the screenplay was thrown out and was replaced by an extended action sequence - the film was gaining momentum, pushing the story and the characters into crazed set pieces, when Gunn's voice disappears into something so formulaic, the wonder and excitement of the worlds that were created here become just another film that doesn't take any chances.

Technically, there is no flaws in the screenplay, acting, direction or especial effects, contributing for a whole well-executed cinematography.
The highest point of the movie is the construction of the personas. All the characters are constructed following the line of a group. The development of its real personalities are centered on their role as group. This is different than what Marvel does with Avengers, for example: every heroes is someone and they together are the Avengers. This great way of construct characters, made Guardians of Galaxy follow and discuss the sentimentalism of them and the sense of the group (this last one can be one of the social critiques).
The social/political discuss can be generalized in some questions: what is evolution, as we think?, what comes with power?, what conservationism, masked by tradition, can bring?, etc. Every scene of the movie is a little discrete social/political/cultural critique , shown in a light and clear way (as Marvel loves to do).
Therefore, Guardians of Galaxy is a well-constructed movie, with no flaws in its development, bringing action, discussion and good heroes to Marvel's universe.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

",When I was a kid. My very first exposure to the Guardians of the Galaxy comic came by way of the Avengers. There was Vance Astro a future astronaut who idolized Captain America and carried his shield into battle. Yondu Charlie 27 Starhawk and others who I forget. they were banded together by Vance Astro who was inspired by the exploits of the Avengers and he decided that the Galaxy needed a Avengerslike team. They were from the 31st century. and granted things change and the Line up of the Gaurdians of the Galazy changed. A few years back The powers at Marvel decided to bring the band back together with some of Marvel's old and forgotten Sci-fi heroes. they brought back Peter Quill A.K.A. Star-Lord to lead this band. They brought back Rocket Raccoon and a old d-list villain called Groot. then there was Gamora the daughter of Thanos the death dealer. Drax the Destroyer a living engine of war. These Guardians had a fairly long run for a sci-fi comic consisting of forgotten heroes. When Marvel annoucned they were bring the Guardian to the big screen I was convinced it wasn't going to work. Too obscure too far reaching of a concept. I heard reports of the making of it. and it sounded interesting. I was going to see it anyways . I've seen every Marvel film in the theatre. My kids are starting to watch them with me. As a whole the entire family enjoys them. but still I was convinced that Marvel had a bomb. The previews were cute and everything looked great. Then my ten year old son. Started asking questions about the Guardians of the Galaxy. He wanted to see it. And I started to rethink my opinion. that it was a dud. Because suddenly looking at it from a child's eyes this was like Star Wars all over again. There was action and suspense and romance. And they tie it together all in a pretty bow. The story is this. In 1988 young Peter Quill loses his mother. He's never known his father and his mother insists his father was not from this world. His father she insists was a being of pure light. She dies and Peter runs away from the hospital where he is taken by a alien ship. 26 years later Peter Quill is a intergalactic thief and pirate who is a womanizer from one end of the galaxy to the other. Quill calls himself Star-Lord and he tries to act like he is more of a bigger deal then he is. When Star-Lord is hired to retrieve a orb from an abandoned planet he sets into motion a series of events. That lead from an unholy alliance between Thanos and Ronan the Accuser a galactic butcher from the Kree race. they want that orb and so does Quill's former team mates the ravagers a band of pirates headed up by Yondu a merc. With a heart of larceny. When Quill eludes both Ronan's Agents and the ravagers Yondu places a price on his head. Quill heads to Xandar the home of the Nova corps which is currently at war with ronan. Quill wants to sell the orb to a dealer. While he tries to sell it he is spotted by two bounty hunters A Raccoon named Rocket and a treelike creature named Groot. Rocket sees that Quill has a bounty on his head of forty thousand units. He thinks he'll be rich. Until he confronts Quill who is attacked by Thanos daughter Gamora. Gamora is willing to betray her father to save Xandar. Star-Lord Rocket Raccoon and Groot get into a fight with Gamora which bring the authorities. they are taken to the Kiln a galactic prison where they meet Drax a walking time bomb. Drax wants to kill Gamora because Ronan killed his wife and daughter. and he is convinced killing Thanos daughter would bring him peace. Gamora reveals to them that she has a buyer for the orb. And he is willing to pay forty million units for it. Rocket and Quill do the math and figure it out they'll be rich. Rocket comes up with a plan to break out. This break out scene is easily one of the film's highlights. after they escape they bring the orb to the Collector. A mad immortal who collects one of every thing that is unique. He reveals the weapon to be a soul gem. A Gem of such vast power you can destroy galaxies with it. Star-Lord discovers he can't let this thing fall into Thanos hands or Ronan's hands. And so begins a quest to save the galaxy from those who would destroy it. The climatic battle is beautifully rendered. And you see the Gaurdians begin to come together as a team. They trust each other. Because of what they've been thru already. By the time the film ends they are no longer a team they are a family. And they are more then ready to assume their new responsibilities as the Guardians of the Galaxy. Now you don't need to be a comics geek to watch this and enjoy it. Nor do you have to be a huge sci-fi fan either.,/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

He doesn't realize that the orb contains a precious and rare gem and there are only 6 that exist. Quill gets involved with the hunt for the gem and meets many odd characters that eventually team up with him. The comedy was perfectly tied with the action in the film. Star-Lord's lines were amazingly witty and hilarious. Each character in the movie has their own unique personality which has its own type of humor.

","Guardians Of The Galaxy is, without a doubt, the weakest Marvel Studios film yet. But it's also the most charming. It suffers because of its very simple origin story. The reasons why many people overlooked this are its likable characters, sweet retro soundtrack (the songs Come And Get Your Love by Redbone and Go All The Way by Raspberries are featured at the beginning), comedy, and impressive visuals. It's really like a colorful lollipop. Once you're done with it though there's not much to return to. Sure, people liked it when Footloose (1984) was mentioned. The whole audience laughed in the theater where I watched the film. The performances by the cast are all good. Even the supporting characters are played well, reminiscent of Maximiliano Hernandez's excellent part as Jasper Sitwell in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Among the heroes it's Dave Bautista who steals the show as the angry yet honorable Drax the Destroyer. The interesting minor touches that he brought to his performance reminded me of the way Dwayne Johnson acts in some of his roles. And Bautista's bits of comedy are some of the most effective and intelligent in the film. I think that Chris Pratt was chosen to play Star-Lord because of his looks. His performance is still good though and it's clear that he's trying, sometimes seeming forced but effective. Screenwriters James Gunn and Nicole Perlman attempted to give every character time to develop, so even Groot (Vin Diesel) gets to show that he's not just houseplant/muscle by the end of the film. The raccoon Rocket (Bradley Cooper) is another well-realized CGI creation. Rocket's uneasy life and his origin made him heartless and hard to get along with, though he is the technical wizard of the team. As Gamora, Zoe Saldana isn't really the tough female character that she says she is. But she did participate in most of the action, and her performance is one of the best in the film. Lee Pace plays the main villain, Ronan the Accuser, a character that I think was tragically underused. Along with Bautista and Saldana, Pace provides the best performance in the film. This doesn't mean much, however, because Ronan has little to do and little to say. He hardly participates in the action, something that's really unforgivable for a villain in a superhero summer blockbuster. And this brings me to another problem that I have with this film. There's a lack of thrilling action. Guardians Of The Galaxy delivers the comedy and the characterization but the action is a disappointment, comprising mostly of chases. Even the predictably big final battle offers few thrills. After the action-packed Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians Of The Galaxy seems tamed in comparison. Because of this I don't have an urge to see Guardians Of The Galaxy again. Despite the convoluted plot I commend director James Gunn for what he's done. It's definitely a film worth seeing because it brings something fresh to the scene.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

","Guardians of the Galaxy. For me, one of the most anticipated movies of the year; it's set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe but features characters that the majority of us have never even heard of. I was very excited going in to this so lets review. The basic premise is that a group of criminals, of various degrees, join together to stop a villain from destroying a world, I know, it sounds like a lot of sci-fi films, but that's it! This movie has so many science fiction elements but no where does it ever feel like a rip-off, it is most definitely it's own thing. I'll start with the story, as I just said it covers some familiar ground but it does it so uniquely it is extremely entertaining, from not just a plot view but also nostalgia from the great sci-fi epics you love; you do get a Star Wars feel, and then you start getting a Star Trek vibe and even Indiana Jones for some of it; but because James Gunn does a fantastic job writing and directing it is comprised of brilliantly unique twists and scenes and characters that any comedy/sci- fi fan will love. Chris Pratt as Peter Quill was entertaining, Zoe Saldana was both interesting and fun as an alien assassin; of course the voice work to both Rocket and Groot were top notch with Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel respectively. Even the wrestler-turned-actor was really good in his role as the very literal Drax bent on revenger for his family and delivered some awesome lines. Talking of lines, the dialogue in this movie is the best; the comedy, the tone, the banter it all works, definitely a few laugh out loud moments. Obviously it's a Marvel movie so the special effects are some of the best you're going to see, with mixing huge real sets with visually stunning CGI of space, and worlds and the colours are very pleasing to the eye. The only bad things I've heard about this movie was that it had a weak villain but for me Ronan had a very powerful presence, I feel that a lot of villains in the MCU have been quite weak (with the exception of Loki and possibly Red Skull) but this guy I enjoyed, he felt like a threat. My personal gripe with the movie was only very minor, first off, the beginning had a very dramatic scene and then literally seconds after it went full comedic which I thought was an awkward transition and secondly was Thanos, he was OK in the plot but Josh Brolin's American accent I felt was very obvious for an alien titan and took me out of the movie slightly.

Guardians from this perspective has more in common with the space western soap opera of Star Wars and Hans Solo, Indiana Jones, and even Kurt Russell's character in the fantasy comedy cult classic Big Trouble In Little China (1986). In many ways, Guardians is more of a derivative of the classic television series Firefly (2002-2003) and becomes more of a parody of that series which offered up a more consistent and well-crafted camaraderie that script writers brought to its renegade crew. Guardians does not seem to fit into the tone of the rest of the Marvel Universe and stretches it attempts at one-line humor along with a storyline that really does not offer much in the way of originality nor consistent scene outcomes (i.e., like a city that remains crowded with residents even as terror reigns down on it) that results in illogical plot inconsistencies and predictable forced outcomes.

","An alliance uneasily develops between five diverse individuals, each after the same valuable orb, in this action-packed science fiction film. It turns out that the orb in question has the power to destroy entire universes, and while the protagonists are initially motivated by greed, willing to sell to the highest bidder, they gradually become the responsible heroes of the title as they instead try to keep the orb out of evil hands. With little explanation of how the orb works, it becomes little more than a Hitchcockian McGuffin, and with a truckload of explosive action sequences towards the end, the film often seems more interested in being a spectacle to look at than spinning a decent yarn. That said, the characters here are surprisingly three dimensional with the film getting most of its zest from how well they interact with each other. Chris Pratt is especially good as the wisecracking Earthling among them with a fondness for 1970s and 80s music, though the best moments are had by a talking raccoon and tree, both genetically modified to the point of being sentient. The film is a little dry in the moments when neither Pratt nor the raccoon nor the tree are on screen, but as they are present in over 90% of the movie, it is an enthralling ride overall even when the action becomes a tad mindless towards the end. The sci-fi content may not be great here, but the humour frequently works, and with such delightfully offbeat characters, it is easy to see why this hit the right note with many filmgoers when it was first released.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

","An angry, confused son attends his mother's deathbed. Fading fast, and heavily medicated, she babbles about angels and shafts of light.

Through scavenging a mysterious orb, he forms an alliance with a green female assassin, a literal-minded hulk, a wily raccoon, and a simple-minded but deadly tree. Everyone needs a family, and this becomes his. Guardians of the Galaxy is a bombastic space opera that throws postmodern self-reflexive humour, and homage to 70s music, into the genre mash. It all blends perfectly. The action scenes are spectacular, the characterisations contrast superbly, and the humour is literally laugh out loud at times. Most of all, the film has heart in a way that most European art-house posers will be snotty about, when secretly they would give their right arm to have this much emotional bang.

Most zoologists consider the raccoon's Procyonid clan just half a twig away from the rodents on the mammalian family tree, which includes rats and Sciuridae (such as Rocky the Flying Squirrel). All these undesirable critters carry rabies, which may well account for Rocket's crazed expression throughout GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY. Any group which numbers Procyonids among its members really cannot claim to be ""guardians"" of the school bus, let alone an entire galaxy. How would you like it if your little one got off the bus one day and said, ""Pops, you need to take me into the doc's office every week for two months so I can get $4,500 of rabies vaccine injected into my butt because Rocket was having a bad hair day and nipped at me""? I think that Marvel and Disney are being highly irresponsible encouraging the spread of rabies through this unjustified promotion of raccoons as fictional role models or ""guardians.""

By the end of the film my family and I had laughed at almost every line Rocket delivered, and genuinely enjoyed the action scenes, being short and sweet with little (but enough) gore that everyone could enjoy it.

It's rare that entertainment can reach any age or inclination. The movie quotes come thick and fast, from Tarkovsky to Spielberg through Disney and Orson Welles (the orb!), and for music buffs, Tyler Bates's soundtrack even contains subtle nods to Leos Janacek (ironically, from his Cunning Little Vixen, hence perhaps an oblique reference to the Rocket the ""hamster"").

This is something, that needs to happen eventually, in order for Marvel to complete its transition from page to screen, because many of their characters and universally historical plot-arcs, take place in outer space.

Whenever movies embrace 'old school' techniques, high qualities in acting, writing, directing and scoring can really shine. Don't get me wrong, ""Guardians of Galaxy"" did have its fare share of special effects – but they did not take center-stage. This is one 'Marvel' movie I will see again.

The action sequences were done really well, as is to be expected from Marvel these days. The plot also unfolded nicely.

In the series, I found that some MCU movies deteriorate with time (Avengers, for example), some stay about the same (Iron Man 1 is still great, whereas Iron Man 3 is still terrible), and then you have the occasional film like ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" that wasn't one of my favorites in the theater, but is much more enjoyable upon a second viewing.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

","Featuring a small-screen actor playing an unfamiliar character from a relatively obscure comic series, Guardians of the Galaxy is a fun, smart movie that proves that superhumans aren't necessarily the driving force behind the immense success of the comic book movie phenomenon. The storyline is as simple as could be: Chris Pratt's Peter Quill has a thing, everyone else wants the thing, hijinks ensue. This structural simplicity allows breakout director James Gunn to stuff Guardians full of crowd-pleasing characters, new and fantastic locations, and the promise of a successful new Marvel franchise.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

","Over the last few years, I've seen an increasing trend for 8+ ratings of new movies on IMDb. Many do not warrant the rating. Even with this in mind, I was expecting at least a good story and good character development because even a 7 movie should be good. Instead, for Guardians of the Galaxy, I got a very plain story with an unsuccessful attempt at character development. While its normal for an action film to move quickly, this movie summarily jumps from one scene to another with a totally contrived plot. The attempts at character development and building friendship were totally lost on me. There was nothing in the story that made me think the characters had a useful reason to unite and get along.

","This movie made me laugh. Most modern Hollywood comedies leave me cold, Adam Sandler, Brat Pack drivel, for example. The reason I enjoyed this was that I liked the characters. The chemistry between the male and female leads was best when they were antagonistic, when he disgusted her. I didn't buy into the romantic aspect of their relationship. The last half hour of the movie was by far the weakest, but I guess that they had to provide some climactic fireworks. The movie worked best when the characters were plotting, bitching and scheming. Also the last half hour would have worked better if the villain was less so-so. I didn't yearn for the downfall of the big villain very much and his female side-kick was sweet rather than menacing. This deflated what should have been a suspenseful climax. The visual and spoken gags were the movie's strong point, which worked best when Rocket was around. Rocket was one of those characters I love. Just his facial expressions alone had me laughing. Without Rocket, the movie would have lost a couple of points.

","When I first saw the trailer for Guardians of the Galaxy, I didn't know what I was watching. As you can tell, I'm not a comic book geek, so I didn't know who the Guardians of the Galaxy were. When Guardians of the Galaxy's reviews were first posted online, I was shocked. I thought that it could be Marvel's first flop. But was I wrong. I convinced my father and a good friend (who wanted to see Hercules) to see it with me. It's hard to say what genre to classify Guardians of the Galaxy, because like it's other Marvel counterparts, it has great action, yet, it has a great sense of wit and humor. Guardians of the Galaxy blends action, adventure, and humor into a great movie. From the beginning, Guardians of the Galaxy has you hooked. Though it's story is cliché, it's characters make up for that. Each of them have their own personality. They're each so different, that they go together perfectly, and the part I see that not many seem to notice, is that they contradict each other. Drax (Dave Bautista), a huge warrior out for vengeance against the main antagonist, contradicts Gamora (Zoe Saldana), a deadly assassin who is was raised by the antagonist. Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper), a ""shoot first ask questions later"" mercenary bounty hunter raccoon, is truly the star of the show, and he contradicts Groot (Vin Diesel), a peaceful humanoid-like tree. And then there's Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), the leader of the group, who is depicted as (at least according to him) a legendary outlaw, out seek treasure. The beginning of the movie sports a very Raiders of the Lost Ark feeling, with Peter Quill (Star-Lord) landing on the abandoned, rocky planet of Morag, to seek out his share of treasure. Little does he know it will lead him on an inter-galactic adventure across the galaxy. What I really enjoyed was it's connection to Star Wars. It felt similar, yet unique. Star-Lord is reminiscent of the personality of Han Solo yet the role of Luke Skywalker. Rocket Raccoon is a funny, radical Han Solo, and his partner-in-crime, Groot, is a peaceful yet powerful being, who only speaks one line. Sounds like Chewbacca, right? Even it's antagonist, Ronan, reminds you of and overly evil Darth Vader, who serves his master. I'll leave that part for you to find out. It probably won't be the next Star Wars (My favorite movies of all time), but it is a fresh, new, take on the sci-fi genre. It also features tons of '70's and '80's pop culture references, due to that being the time Star-Lord grew up on Earth, such as it's catchy theme song, ""Put Down the Feeling"". In conclusion, if you were to summarize Guardians of the Galaxy in three words, you could say it's like the Avengers in Space, but it topples the 2012 Blockbuster hit due to its humor, action, and the creation of this magnificent, jaw-dropping galaxy. I would say, that without a doubt, Guardians of the Galaxy has the greatest CGI and computer effects I have ever seen in a film. I thoroughly enjoyed Guardians of the Galaxy, and I can say without a doubt that it is the best Marvel movie that I have seen, and definitely the riskiest, but it all paid off. Guardians of the Galaxy is a great movie, and I recommend everyone who wants a light-hearted space film to go see it.

","This film, while it has a thin-ish plot and unoriginal villains who aren't as interesting as other great comic book villains, makes up for that in full with hilarious comedic relief in almost every scene, believable character motives and development as well as good pacing. I loved basically everything about this film. I also like how the main hero, Peter Quill, is just some ordinary Joe Shmoe who happens to get blasted onto a great adventure and meets great friends along the way. Perhaps the most interesting character, though, is Rocket Raccoon, who is voiced greatly by Bradley Cooper. There is hardly any reason to not go see this film. Plus it is, for the most part, family friendly and the humor is well written. Possibly Marvel's greatest film yet.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

","Comic Con is still fresh in a lot of folks minds with SOO much huge news.So much so I was worried that everyone was kind of pushing the upcoming Guardians release to the side.Thankfully this past weekend showed that Guardians is here to stay.We start on Earth with a young Peter Quill aka Star-Lord who just tragically lost his mother. Fast forward to adulthood and Star-Lord is a Pop loving,one lining,likable space scavenger.After picking up a mysterious orb and getting the attention of our other Guardians and some space Hun named Ronan the Accusor,we set off on what I can only describe is a action packed,space roller coaster with never before seen worlds,strange alien life,and Merle Dixon looking like a hillbilly version of Night Crawler in X2(Hes really awesome in this movie by the way).If you're a fan of anything sci-fi you're gonna have at least a minuscule attraction to this latest Marvel beast.Chris Pratt is great as Star-Lord.Zoe Saldana is another addition to this years amazing roster of awesome female characters.Rocket Raccoon is the big money here and STEALS THE SHOW!The villain of Ronan was decent I thought but felt like filler for Thanos.This is why i was all for Disney taking over Marvel Stud.No expense is spared here with GORGEOUS effects and action sequences.There were a lot of good use of makeup and practical effects which always reminds me of Star Wars and thats always a good thing.There were a lot of decently filmed fight sequences that really looked good.The story isn't the most original however.The whole McGuffin driven plot is used over and over again in super hero movies but thankfully the writing,the great character development and the direction really make this a unique and refreshing experience for me considering how many superhero movies I watch.While it gets all the superhero movie standards no problem,again its the humor and lets not forget the incredible soundtrack that reserves this movie a spot in my top movies of the year list.This is everything I wanted it to be.Fun,hilarious,breathtakingly sharp and I GIVE IT MY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION.

","The best actor was a tree being with a three word vocabulary. The lead actor's character is basically playing Stifler in Space to the extent that he even looks like Seann William Scott. Why not cast Scott instead of someone who is obviously still learning how to act? The dialog was weak and often inconsistently assigned to characters. Although the beginning was decent, I quickly lost interest when a hooded bad guy spoke and sounded exactly like Star Wars' Darth Sidious. Then a huge bad guy showed up with a face that looked exactly like Hell Boy. I read several reviews that said this movie was hilarious. Seriously? The second half of the movie must have been a real hoot, because in the first hour (before several of us in the audience left), I chuckled once. I cannot understand why there are so many positive reviews for a movie that, although contained decent special effects, was riddled with horrible acting and worse writing.

","I hate to criticize such an apparently loved film, but Guardians of the Galaxy failed to be the film it had the potential to become. For starters, the writing was a bit weak with a plot quite similar to that of The Avengers and therefore many parts of the story were way too familiar. The dialogue was a bit childish as well, and none of the jokes were really that clever. In fact, very rarely did anyone laugh in the theater while watching the movie. One of the weakest parts of the movie was the fact that many of the emotional attachments and bonds were not nearly developed enough; for example, the relationship between Peter Quill and his mother, Rocket and his friendship with Groot, the love connection between Peter Quill and Gamora, and some others. In addition, the characters themselves felt a bit underdeveloped. And finally, for a Marvel movie, none of the action sequences were particularly stunning. They felt for me a bit slow-paced and unexciting. Still, some strengths the movie had were great visuals, nice costumes, and a good variety of personalities. But in summary, this movie failed to justify all the hype that has formed for this film.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

","So I watched this movie because it's Marvel, but I don't know a single thing about the backstory. And also for the good-looking Karen Gillan and Lee Pace (who definitely do not look good here but more like unrecognizable). At first, it is really confusing. Not until halfway through the movie did things start to fall into place. Here are the few reasons why you should watch this movie. 1. Groot. He is really cute but also good at fighting. I reckon he will be as popular as Minions soon. 2. Rocket. He is also cute and really funny with all his puns. 3. Drax. At first you find him irritating. I think he looks like Jeremy Renner (hawkeye). He deadpans a lot. But then he became funnier when he's interacting with Groot. 4. The visuals. I think the city of Zandar look great and all their gadgets is like ""Men in Black"". 5. Karen Gillan. She sounds really smooth and she looks so eerie. Somehow I think Peter's mother look like her. 6. The violence. Although this movie is supposed to be lighter and not so serious, the violence is more than other Marvel movies. Want to see a ""pen"" stabbing in and out of people? How about impalements? You can see them here. 7. Anti-heroes. If that's your thing, you can have your fill of them. Only Groot and Peter seems the most heroic. 8. The plot is simple. Just break out of prison and run from the bad guys and get the orb. No multi-layers of intricate plot. Things I did not really like: 1. The alien makeup kind of restricts the emotions of the face? You can't tell from looking at them. 2. Zoe Saldana always plays the stoic action girl like Colombiana etc so it gets really boring. And no idea when did Peter fall in ""love"" with her. I'm like in Avengers there is no obvious ""love"". To conclude, if you like simple, funny movies, just watch this. This is the best kind of simple, funny movies. I like these kinds of movies too so I'm quite satisfied with it.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

The fact that it was long and drawn out, did not enhance it. I think it should've stayed a comic. Also, was there any point in having Bradley Cooper as the voice of Rocket? This did nothing for Brad. Good actor but he's better known for his looks/acting rather than voice, which you do need for CGI - otherwise there's no point. Same with Vin Diesel, no point in him just grunting - anyone can do that. Poor film all round. I gave it a 6 at first but as I write, I realise how bad it was... Advice: watch if under 18.

","Guardians of the Galaxy was one of the most surprising films to come out of Marvel.

Chris Pratt plays Peter Quill and he makes the character as handsome, charming, and epic as he always does; while each other team member is played to great comedic effect as well as emotional effect. The cast of characters is so incredibly likable and this may have to do with how they as characters deal with their personal flaws and learn to accept them in themselves and their friends. This is the first MCU movie that shows life throughout the universe on multiple planets, with many species of people, that are all living in a large society. It sets up and explains infinity stones providing a way for the audience to follow the large arc of the MCU. Finally the reason this movie got so much praise and publicity, its amazing soundtrack that is both diegetic and nondiegetic. The concept that the whole soundtrack is a series of songs on Peter's Walkman is interesting and fun, it allows for the soundtrack of the second to be easily set up, and it features all of the best feel good songs from a very nostalgic time period.

","Guardians of The Galaxy, while not the best film released by Marvel Studios, is probably one of the most fun Marvel movie to date. This is probably the second most enjoyable of these movies to me below Thor. This film was a surprise and I'm glad that this seems to be catching on. This is Marvel's most risky project by far. Not only was this subject matter virtually unknown to the public eye before this but it is also not really a superhero film which Marvel has been associated with up until now.

","Marvel Studios has become an idiocratic cult that has somehow created for itself a cinematic niche which only it can fill and sustain. Year after year, Marvel manages to garner critical acclaim with flimsy, repetitive narratives and tiresome characters, critics and the masses alike revelling in obvious exercises of money-grubbing banality. Age of Ultron, even as a comic book film, was senseless, feeling almost like a remake of its much better (but still poor) predecessor. Ant Man was laughably clichéd, barely scraping by on its mildly intriguing visual innovation. Fantastic Four was ghastly. And the Avengers are the single most annoying bundle of inconsistent characters that I have ever been unfortunate enough to acquaint myself with. Glancing at the synopses for Marvel's upcoming endeavours, I am struck at how similar they all seem to older Marvel fare; conceptually impaired, overly serious, and all thoroughly atrocious.

","Technical issues should not be a significant factor in watching a movie. They were when I watched a new copy of this film on DVD-it jammed there times in an otherwise functioning DVD player. The film is good-on the big screen-but its sometimes very dense visual field will not translate well onto the smaller screen unless of course someone has a very large TV at home. This also probably represents the best of what Marvel comics had to offer. When I was younger I was familiar with all the different comics and most of them were not very appealing-which would be most of the Marvel comics-since they were often drawn in an overly stylish way that was like using a visual language of 'artistic clichés' which was not very creative. For a decade at least there has been a massive amount of attention expended in turning Marvel comics into movies-and very little has been seen from the other comic book creator-DC comics-which was generally thought of as having the better artwork, compared to Marvel comics. This is a fun film but its success will probably only spur more adaptations of the other essentially repetitive and dull comics that Marvel churned out month after month for years on end. It is as if someone thinks that comic adaptations are always good for adult viewing also as if nurturing a never-ending childhood should be the goal of the entertainment industry. Since most of this subject matter is movies with a significant amount of violence in them that should concern adults. It should not be that kids are growing up with all violent movies and adults should not also be expected to always enjoy watching that kind of thing also-as if they were children as well, when they are not.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

","Marvel comics is the greatest comic books company of all time. They own the most famous characters (Spider-Man, Iron Man etc.) representing a pantheon of legends, most of them created by Stan Lee, who changed the history of comics forever. Good stories, characters with human features you could relate to, even though they were extremely powerful. All of this plus a good share of humor if possible (Spider-Man sarcasm is legendary) is the trademark of the Marvel empire. Now this empire has become a film empire, and given those treats, they have great material for decades. And I want to be there to see it... Abducted as a child in the late 80's, Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is now a grown-up space pirate who calls himself ""Star-Lord"". When he steals an orb, he becomes a fugitive chased by demigods like Thanos, alien race Lords like Ronan and some other nice people around he will have to ally with. Chris Pratt is Quill, a not so cool captain as the Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) from Firefly (Joss Whedon, 2002-03), but with enough charisma to lead the party. Bradley Cooper is Rocket, a bad-ass raccoon with anger issues and Vin Diesel is Groot, a suave alien tree. The rest of the band is Zoe Saldana as Gamora, an assassin that deep down is a lovely lady and Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer, a well-spoken goon. It is quite a fun cast to be honest. Like I said before, this is entertainment in Marvel fashion, action packed films, loads of fun, and as a bonus, an awesome soundtrack, which will cheer you up anytime. To be honest, mainstream tends to be vulgar, and abuse of CGI is a must nowadays, but not always. Sometimes, though, when you let go and just enjoy the ride, it's great, and much more if there is a good story, entertaining, not pretentious and impeccably made.

","Ciaran's Review:I remember when i first saw GotG open with a nine, with positive reviews and then opening with 160 million dollars worldwide i was amazed and it was at this point that i made the decision to go watch this movie. Did i make the right decision? Yes. Guardians of the Galaxy's story line is one that is intriguing, it follows quite an ordinary structure (in terms of a bunch of outcasts come to form a powerful team), but it is what happens in this structure that is so intriguing. The film doesn't waste anytime building character, and they really nailed building characters, throughout the whole film you feel connected to the characters, which is what film is all about, feeling connected to the story and characters who experience it and GotG managed to do this so well, and that is one reason why it is one of the best films of this year. Now, when i saw that James Gunn the writer of the Scooby-Doo films was writing and directing i was worried, but when i saw the film apparently i had nothing to worry about, as the directing was smooth and enjoyable to watch, he didn't have any weird camera angles, at times you did notice the odd camera angle but for the most part you forgot who the director was, i personally think that Guardians of the Galaxy is James Gunn's best film and i think he will overtime become known for it. Onto acting, when i saw the cast for GotG, i thought it could work, and it really did work, Chris Pratt was the best fit, he had humor and he played his character well, Zoe Saldana was the only person who could play Gamora, she was fast and witty, Dave Bautista is perhaps the best wrestler to movie star to hit our screens since the rock, he aced his performance as Drax, Vin Disel's voice suited Groot, and Bradley Cooper as Rocket, i really think Cooper stole the show, when Rocket was on screen you watched him and listened to him, even when he wasn't on screen you wanted to see Rocket, i really believe he stole the show. Now there is one thing i had a problem with and that is Ronan the Accuser, as a villain his motives were quite average, and i think if he had been written to have a bit more comedy, he would have worked as a character, other than that, Lee Pace really made the character his own. Onto CGI and let me tell you, at no point in this movie did the CGI look cheap, the whole way through the CGI was convincing, so well done to GotG's effects department for pulling off these great results. Now the soundtrack in this movie i have one word for it 'awesome', every song suited the situation, it tied the whole movie together, i think if you removed the soundtrack from this movie and replaced it, i think the whole movie would just not have the same emotional feel because the soundtrack is so important in this film. To sum it all up, Guardians of the Galaxy is a hilarious comedy with spectacular action and a whole lot of heart, and that is why Guardians of the Galaxy is getting a 9/10 from me.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

It's laugh-out-loud funny on multiple occasions, it has a great cast of unique characters that are all played fantastically by the actors, and the story has a beating heart at its core. The film works so successfully because of the way in which alien characters (including a hybrid raccoon and a talking tree) are realistically portrayed and developed. Somehow the film manages to always feel human and something that we can relate to. On top of this, the action sequences are spectacular and, since we truly care about all of the key players, there isn't a disconnect between the audience and the CGI on display. Also, who could forget the film's fantastic 80s fuelled soundtrack that plays a large part in the story and the character development.

959,30 September 2014,jbell8-121-86667,10," Brief overview of Guardian of the Galaxies
","Over the summer I had seen the advertisements and commercials for the movie, Guardians of the Galaxy. When I first saw the commercial, all I could think was this looks silly and then I saw the fact it was part of the Marvel series and I was torn whether or not to go watch it while it was still in theaters. It did not look good but maybe it would play a big role in the Marvel movie series but I did end of going to see it for the heck of it and absolutely loved it. Overall, the movie was humorous, very entertaining, and in my opinion, a great addition to the Marvel series and even gained a rating of 92% on the movie critic website rotten tomatoes. Throughout the movie, the thing that stood out the most was the humor part of the movie. There were parts of the movie I just could not stop laughing because it was so silly and just so amusing to watch and enjoyable. I mean, the way you know it is a humorous movie is when you come out of the theater repeating lines and talking about parts of the movie and still just laughing as much as you did when you saw the movie and this is a movie that passes that test. Another killer part of the movie that made it so good was the soundtrack that went through the movie. The biggest role the soundtrack has to a movie is to provide the noise for times where there is not dialog and just brings a smile to your face. In the movie, the main leader of the Guardian of the Galaxies, Star-Lord, he plays a tape his mother gave him that brings back the classic musical hits that you just cannot help but sing along to and just smile while remembering the good old days. Overall the acting was pretty superb and each actor brought their own flare and became the character very well even just in the voice overs for characters such as Rocket and Groot. Apart of the movie that I really enjoyed was the way each actor had their chance to make their character shine and make them seem important and walking away you realize that each character had importance to the group and the actors all came together to form a pretty solid team called the Guardians of the Galaxies. Probably the most controversial aspect of the movie is the whole Marvel aspect. Marvel over the years has made a killing in suckering viewers to come see their latest hits and leave us at the end wanting another Marvel movie to come to theaters to continue the story. I know many people saw the commercials thought the same thing I did, ""Who on earth are the Guardians of the Galaxies?"" Most people know who Spiderman, Ironman, or even the incredible hulk are but unless you read the comic books, you would most likely have no clue who the Guardians of the Galaxies are. Throughout the movie though, I believe the writer did a good job in tying in the Marvel universe and made a point by using characters most people would have no idea how they were connected to the story line that viewers have come to know through all other Marvel movies and the big hitter that brings them all together, The Avengers. Going off the MPAA rating of the movie, PG-13, seems somewhat appropriate due to little bit of foul language and a couple of references to alcohol and gambling. However, I do think the movie can still be considered a family because it does bring a humorous aspect and nothing to raunchy is presented and besides, what kid does not love a talking raccoon or even a tree that can only say, ""I am Groot"". Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and would definitely watch it over again. Marvel has done a very good job in adding a new addition to the movie series through the all the humor, the acting, the action, the soundtrack and in the end, I walked away from the movie hoping to see more of the Guardians of the Galaxies in future Marvel movies.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

","For a Sci-fi film with enviable comic relief this story had to have one of the saddest opening scenes ever when we first encounter a young Peter Quill (Wyatt Oleff), who appears to be just any small town USA young boy experiencing a devastating hardship, then his life takes an incredible turn for the unexpected. What this scenes does besides pose a question of who fathered him it sets up the soundtrack that accompanies the entire film, since in 1988 everyone had their Sony Walkman and Peter was no exception. We immediately fast forward to 26 years later and find an adult Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) who is a bit of a scalawag, on a commissioned job to retrieve a mysterious orb, which leads to unimaginable adventure. The story of how the Guardians came together was happening on the forefront, but there were also some other major stories taking place like a maniacal Ronan (Lee Pace) bent on destroying a world, Drax (Dave Bautista) driven by revenge, whatever the heck was going on with Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker) who was some sort of space pirate and a sibling rivalry that made for one of the great fight scenes. There were a number of things that tied this film to other stories that have been told focusing on the Marvel Universe including Benicio Del Toro reprising his role as the Collector who we only encounter briefly in Thor the Dark World (after credits) and Thanos another after credits character previously introduced. The special effects in this film were as big a star as the actual stars especially for the only characters who were already in league together, Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Groot (Vin Diesel). These characters always felt as real as Star-Lord, Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Drax. Who would have expected to come to a movie and feel any kind of emotional attachment to a raccoon?! If you stick around through the credits you will understand why the effects were first rate, there had to be at least ten animation companies credited. As with all the Marvel films there is an after credits scene, however the thing is if you are too young to remember the pop culture of the 80s you may not get the joke.

The Soundtrack used in the movie is enough to make this kid of the 80's want to watch the movie again. The movie is action packed from start to finish yet has enough humor in it to make you constantly laugh. The special effects lighting and color pallet made me want to see the sequel.
I would recommend this movie to everyone who like action films, the story-line that is developed for us to watch is very good and the characters playing off each other is great.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

","I just saw GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY! The newest Marvel movie is about a rag tag group of mercenaries, thugs and thieves who find themselves building an unlikely partnership to get paid... or save the world, whichever comes first. This film marks the third entry in Marvel's phase 2 of films and on top of being the most risky property to date, I have to say that that it is so far the best. As skeptical as I was about this movie shining beyond its little recognized source material, it really turned out to be something that was really worth seeing! Everything here works, the dialogue is witty, the characters are very funny, the special effects are top notch and the action is literally out of this world. If you liked movies like The 5th Element or shows like Firefly and it's subsequent movie sequel Serenity, then you're going to LOVE this movie. If I had any complaints, I would say that at first it is rather tough to get into. There are an awful lot of names and planets and characters and plot lines that come at you pretty darn quick and if you're not ready for it you might just get lost. Also, you might want to put your brain into ""anime mode"" for the first 20-30 minutes or so where you just believe whatever you see without question, because the film asks you to believe a whole lot of really out there stuff compared to even the most outrageous earth based Marvel movies. That aside, I have to say that this is one of Marvel's best movies to date, so even if you're not a Guardians fan, you will still enjoy it and who knows, this movie just may make a fan out of you.

","""Guardians of the Galaxy"" was never on my list of movies that I want to see in 2014 because I wasn't too crazy on the marketing that they putted for the movie, but I did give it a fair shake by going into low expectations like the ""TMNT"" reboot that I have just reviewed today (check it out), and was actually really enjoying it. The ""TMNT"" reboot was okay and it did entertained me, but I was really entertained by this one more than the ""TMNT"" reboot. As you read you this review there could be some little spoilers. So here it is: I actually did had a fun time seeing this movie in theaters, and I did thought it was funny. The cast in this movie like Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, and such were all pretty good in their own roles. The action in this movie are very well done, but I don't think they are the greatest or shall I say epic. I thought it did a pretty good by telling story along with the characters that I need to know about. James Gunn has done a fine job on directing movie, and did told a very good story. The special effects in the movie are actually very fascinating to look at. The music by Tyler Bates was fine, but I don't think it is really that memorable or one of those movies scores that I would listen to; the used of 1970's soundtrack really does work for the movie, and there could be some that many other people that love 70's music would pretty much like this movie. Although, I don't think its Marvel's best comic book movie because I am still sticking up with ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" as not only Marvel's best, but the best comic book movie of 2014. The humor in this movie is really funny, but it's not really laugh out loud hilarious. Also, the villain in this movie was weak, and not really the best villain that I have seen in a Marvel movie because I have seen better villains in other Marvel movies. Also, during the post credit scene, I was actually surprised to see a Howard the Duck cameo which I think that Marvel might make a legitimate reboot of the character, and do things right than the original 1986 movie which I am going to review that after doing a review of ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" Overall, it is a fun comic book movie and I think you would enjoy it too. I give this movie a 9 out of 10.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

","Throughout this movie, we see an essential development in the marvel series in which we learn of an orb that holds an infinity stone. We follow a group of strangers who learn of the true nature of this orb and its contents. As this movie continues we meet new characters who become vital to the marvel universe. These characters are Star-Lord played by Chris Pratt, Gamora played by Zoe Saldana, Rocket Raccoon played by Bradley Cooper, Groot played by Vin diesel, Drax the destroyer played by Dave Bautista, & Thanos played by Josh Brolin. In my opinion, one of the main themes in this movie is the power of teamwork. Through the introduction of these characters we see the developing relationships between Star-Lord, Gamora, Rocket, & Groot who start as a group of strangers pitted against each other. Soon we see these individuals find common ground to motivate them. We learn that each character Star-Lord, Gamora, Rocket, Groot, & Drax are capable of completing hard tasks by themselves, but once brought together they can complete something even more challenging for instance in the scene in which they are in taken to the Kyln Prison, the group of them are able to break out. this is only able to take place because they all work together to complete the task set ahead of them. After they break out they have more arguments but end up establishing a new motive to work together this, of course, being money. They find out Gamora has a buyer willing to pay top dollar for the orb and its contents. This drives the group to find Gamoras buyers and make a sale. Some problems arise and the stone falls into Ronan's' hands.
Ronan the Accuser played by Lee Pace is a person dead set on destroying the planet Xander home to the Nova Corps.
Now Star-Lord, Gamora, Rocket, Groot, & Drax must stop Ronan from destroying Xander. Another great example of this is near the end of the movie where they are fighting an extremely powerful enemy known as Ronan. We see the 5 main characters take on Ronan and when it looks as though all is lost these 5 characters band together using the power stone to defeat Ronan, Save the Nova Corps, and keep the planet Xander safe.
Through all of these examples we can see a motif that has been developed. If these five main characters did not work together, a whole society would have been destroyed possibly even the galaxy.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

But let's take a look at a seemingly underrated film in the marvel series: ""Guardians of the Galaxy""- a bold and exciting new film that is not afraid to stray from the typical marvel movie expectations. This film, written and directed by James Gunn and released in 2014, is an exciting, humorous, action packed and heart-warming film that takes place in space and follows the life of main character Peter Quill. ""Guardians"" highlights the journey of 5 intergalactic misfits as they, brought together accidentally, pursue their eventual mission to save the universe.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014
988,24 January 2020,n-63826,9," Guardians of the Galaxy has viewers Hooked on a Feeling
","Esteemed director James Gunn began to form his reputation of creating modern classics by directing and co-writing Guardians of the Galaxy, utilizing all the action, sci-fi, and humor diehard Marvel fans adore. Gunn creates another epitome of Marvel by utilizing spectacular special effects, a strong plot, and an amazing soundtrack of masterpieces all ages can enjoy countless times.
Guardians of the Galaxy follows the life of a human, Peter (Star-Lord) Quill as he transforms from a bounty hunter caring only about his next paycheck to a hero with emotions, fighting for the good of the multiverse.
Peter Quill was born on Earth in 1988, and after his mother's death, he was taken in by a bounty hunter named Yondu, who quickly became a father figure for Quill. Growing up with a ruthless pack of bounty hunters shaped an unapologetic and apathetic life for young Quill, who quickly turned to follow in the steps of Yondo, joining him in becoming a fellow bounty hunter. While searching for an orb worth a small fortune, Quill discovers its true power and value, and decides it is necessary to keep it from falling into the hands of the powerful Ronan the Accuser. Similar to many Marvel classics, Star-Lord needs to band together with unexpected friends along his journey as he attempts the impossible while blasting 70's rock through his cassette player with distinct orange headphones.
Gunn provides fans with an outstanding film that grossed over $700,000,000 worldwide, by utilizing his happy-go-lucky sense of humor, amazing casting and a carefully compiled soundtrack that brings the atmosphere classic rock into modern films. Gunn demonstrates this dynamic combination from the very beginning, where Star-Lord can be seen dancing goofily while fighting small dog-like creatures to ""Come and Get Your Love"" by Redbone. Combined, these characteristics tie together an appealing film that can be admired by everyone.
A marvel movie wouldn't seem adequate without roles being filled by big actors, and James Gunn exceeded those expectations. Big names like Chris Pratt, Vin Diesel, and Bradley Cooper fill the roles of key characters, adding to the appeal of this goofy action-packed film.
Perhaps the most well respected aspect of Guardians of the Galaxy is the admired discography. The soundtrack for Guardians of the Galaxy is considered one of the greatest soundtracks in a film, placed amongst other classics like Black Panther, Almost Famous, and Grease. Star-Lord carries the last memory of his mother, a cassette tape titled ""Awesome Mix"", with him at all times. This tape contains numerous well known tunes from the late 60's and 70's, and these songs formed the soundtrack for the film. Gunn uses these songs to contribute to the mood created in multiple scenes. For example, when planning and arming the team for his attack, Gunn uses the song ""Cherry Bomb"" by the Runaways. The lyrics and music to this song create the tension, anticipation and excitement that Starlord was feeling during that moment.
Every film has room for improvement, and this one is no exception. The carefully placed stylistic additions can be concealed by the constant action and violence persists throughout the movie. Like most Marvel films, action is the main priority, so plot and character development can sometimes be lost in the conflict.
Through the entire film, James Gunn helps create yet another perfect example on how Marvel continues to meet and exceed viewers expectations. Each cast member and song was carefully selected, and combined they create a beautiful example of how modern action films can still be calculated works of art.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

The one thing I was disappointed with was the character and story development, the storyline seemed like it was written as if we already knew the plot and characters, which I suppose some might have, seeing as it was a comic book series before it was a movie. The comedy aspect to this movie was really well written which makes up for the rushed development of the story. This was an interesting movie for marvel to put out, seeing as it was not following Marvels recent theme of super hero movies such as ""Iron Man"" ""Thor"" ""Captain America"" and so on.

1017,20 September 2014,ahsanland,9," Utter morons comparing this motion picture with star wars as if its an institution
","I am writing this review after being disappointed by the idiocy of some Moronic sheep who think one creative story-telling effort should be compared with another. And then deducting point based on what they think this motion picture does not have in comparison to star wars. And what's disturbing is that they deducted points on story elements that were part of the star wars story, obviously it wouldn't have that, its a different story. Sure there are similarities but that might be only because of one key character Groot i believe have people confused with Chewbacca from star wars. This is not an inspiration from star wars. This motion picture is an adaptation of several characters and stories published in over forty years of print. It could be debated that when marvel decided to put these old characters into a team (that was in 2007 annihilation:conquest) they might have put in Groot as a replacement for chewy in the team. as far as star- lord is concerned he has always been depicted in that aspect, a bit rough around the edges, outlaw-ish. The film had a few flaws to how simplistically the conflict between Ronan and Xandar was explained and how did Ronan amass such resources and why didn't Kree penalize Ronan for disobeying Kree law. One very smart approach the writers took was to represent nova-corp. as a Xandarian police force stripped of powered suits in contrast to the published source material. Pacing was pitch perfect, certain generic elements were written and directed differently. A lot of the characters' team efforts were represented with the feel from the source material. Character evolution and redemption was also hinted at. Star wars is not an institution morons, its just a story, its not even its own genre, there are several films in this genre. Far-scape could be compared to star-wars. Rocket raccoon, star-lord, Drax, Gamora, moon-dragon, quasar, nova are very old characters and stories.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

","I have always thought of Guardians very fondly and considered it to be one of my favorite Marvel films, but I had not seen it in several years. Today I revisited it, and found that although there are still funny moments throughout, and the Guardians themselves are quite likable together, it is certainly lacking as far as drama and stakes. Ronan is a very weak villain, with no real background or defining trait other than being powerful or mean. His plan also is not particularly compelling either, as the destruction of a planet that we are not invested in is just kind of eh. I was also surprised by how many bad actors/bad lines were in this movie (particularly in minor roles), which I think was overshadowed in my mind from previous viewings by the joyful spirit of the film. All in all, this movie does a good job of setting up future films in the MCU and establishing these core characters, and delivers some memorable moments (ie the final dance scene/some good lines), but is not Marvel's best work for all two hours.

With plenty of CGI/special effects to be captivated by it also makes a strong case in being in its own realm separate from the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's heroes and heroines and makes for a very promising film to close out the summer. My expectations were high and yet it not only met them it exceeded them. The tone throughout is pitch perfect. It is amazing to see how efficiently we were introduced to so many layered characters and yet the movie never lags.

","The Marvel Cinematic Universe's focus on Captain America, Iron Man, and Thor has become routine or even a tad rote, but here comes a potent blast of fresh air in the form of the Guardians of the Galaxy. A type of pop space opera, the film pairs a Earth-born outlaw with four dysfunctional alien compatriots, including a machine-gun-wielding raccoon and a scene-stealing living tree (an adorable monster and my personal favourite). Together, they combat outer-space evil. It may build to an unsurprising—though still involving—sequence of race-to-save-the-world combat and pursuit, but there are so many exciting, hilarious, and/or riveting details and detours along the way. In fighting shape for the role which will forever change his promising career, Chris Pratt shines, exuding intense man-of-action confidence while also dispensing wry one-liners with an expert's ease. As one of the other guardians, a musclebound alien dead-set on avenging his slain family, martial artist and wrestler Dave Bautista is a pleasant surprise. His imposing physique is complemented by unexpectedly spot-on deadpan comic timing. The protagonists in general are wonderful; the tensions and bonds within the fresh-faced cosmic superhero team are not only introduced, but also deeply felt.

","Prior to their 2014 film, the Guardians of the Galaxy were not household names. But after the surprise success of this film, the heroes were catapulted to stardom. I was a skeptic prior to watching Guardians, however watching this film was some of the most enjoyment I've ever got from a cinematic experience. A unique concoction of sci-fi, humour and the superhero genre, James Gunn has crafted one of the best superhero films to date, one that isn't afraid to take itself too seriously. The direction from Gunn is stylish, and his script charming and heartfelt. The way he juggles humorous moments with emotional punches and action scenes with exposition is remarkable. The cast is on point; perhaps one of the best ensembles in a superhero movie. Chris Pratt is an inspired choice as Star Lord, and is delightful throughout. Zoe Saldana makes a convincing Gamora, and Karen Gillian gives a solid performance as her sister Nebula. Drax the destroyer (Dave Bautista) is instantly likable, and Benicia Del Torro makes a very passable alien as the collector. There's even recognized star power in the form of voice actors Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel, portraying lovable duo Rocket Racoon and Groot (who can only say the words ""I am Groot"" and is still easy to adore). Other performances such as Michael Rooker as Yondu are well done, but if there is a weakness in the film then it's the villain Ronan (Lee Pace), who lacks character development. The story arcs aside from Ronan are excellently done, and the music and soundtrack are brilliantly chosen (as they are in the sequel). Spectacle is also incredible, and the special effects and CGI convincing.

My biggest fear was that this was going to be too kiddie (the talking raccoon in the preview and the tree). but it wasn't. It's highly entertaining with a good plot, good characters and great pace. The special effects are amazing.. you completely forget that the tree and the raccoon are digital characters, you just accept them. This is a movie for the whole family, also a movie I think single adults males and females will enjoy. It reminds me of when I first saw Star Wars and I am not afraid to compare it to that glee I felt after wards. I think this film is deserved of multiple viewings and a must have when it released. And Chris Pratt is the perfect ""Star Lord"".. sort of like both Harrison Ford character Indiana Jones and Hans Solo wrapped up into one"".",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

","Since Star Wars was released in 11977 people in the industry as well as fans have predicted the next franchise like it. This one may have come the closest to it. It a marketing dream. I see all kinds of toys video games, cartoons, rides etc. coming from this movie. I am also sure there will be at least one sequel, if not an entire new franchise. It has the feel of Star Wars or it made me feel like I felt when I saw movies like that as a kid. It also kind of reminded me of Indiana Jones and Back to the Future. Special FX are certainly nice in a movie, but FX are a dime a dozen these days. I want a good plot too, so it's nice to see movie that has the best of both worlds. It is amazing looking in all scenes. It's funny and fun. It's touching and will getting you a little teary eyed at points. It's really exciting. That's why I think it will make good rides and video games. The battle scenes are stunning. I looked on the Run Pee app and it said there is really no place in this movie that is good to go to the bath room. You'd better go before the movie starts. It has so many cool characters like Rocket and Groot who steal the show and such great actions scenes. It's just a neat concept. Chris Pratt is a human who, as a boy get taken away into space and ends up being a thief. He steels the wrong thing and ends up getting chased all over the galaxy by people who want it and him. He makes enemies and later friends along the way and they form a Scooby gang to try to ""save the day"" so to speak, mainly from a funky looking war lord named Ronan with some tar or something on his face, who is played so well by Lee Pace. It's also got a great cast and I just love how far Chris Pratt has come. Not only is he funny and lovable, but he's hot too. Bradley Cooper, Vinn Diesel, Zoe Saldona, John C. Reilly, Glenn Close, Batista, Lee Pace and they all do a great job. They really play some silly over the top characters convincingly. I can really tell that all the actors really put themselves into these characters. It is a really witty script. I love the running gag where everyone can't understand human things like metaphors. Batista delivers some great lines with this gag. Finally, I will definitely be getting the soundtrack. It's all great 70's and 80's songs, some of my favorites in fact. I am going to have to re-do my top movies of 2014 to include this one obviously.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

Granted it's a good children's movie to take your brother to but I can't understand how full-grown adults overrate this and define it as a masterpiece. There's very little character development and a poor-written plot. The movie tries to get deeper into the main character's personality and psychology by including a walkman uploaded with songs left from his mom from Earth where he was abducted from. But it doesn't make any sense for our character to be attached to these songs and to his mother after all his experience.

Guardians of the Galaxy had all the ingredients to be another blockbuster Marvel movie yet somehow sidestepped (most) of those pitfalls. I have to be honest, I had never heard of the comic book and actually never even saw a trailer before seeing this. There was a TON of action and there were the clichés that make me want to throw-up (tough guy girls, bad guys that are just cartoonishly bad, unstoppable & unknown powers being volleyed between the good guys and the bad guys),but here's what made this movie great: The plot was unpredictable, it was original and creative - except the main guy being kind of Rocket Man/Ironman-ish, the cast of heroes were unlike anything I've seen (especially from Marvel movies). Lastly, just when you think CGI has reached its peak, somehow some studio comes along and is still able to wow you with the visuals! This movie was visually stunning! PS Groot was easily my favorite character and probably won me over for the entire film.

It's quite a shame that negative critics compare it as such, as if the writers, directors, actors, etc. had expected it too. One common theme it seems among the negative critics is that they seem bitter or just generally unhappy. They went after this movie for the silliest reasons. A.) it failed as a comedy. Guess what? it wasn't supposed to be 100% a comedy. Most people got that. B.) It's not a great movie like a Beautiful Mind and doesn't belong in the top 250....that doesn't even make sense to compare it to that movie, which negates any credibly for that review. I stopped reading after that comment. C.)Chris Pratt failed as the lead super hero....did you read the comic and understand the character he played? He played it PERFECTLY as designed. I could go on, but not worth the time. Overall, the majority of the public loved this movie and ""got it"" and didn't over think it. They just had a really good time at the movies, I'm sure. It's just frustrating for me to see reviewers give this movie 1s and 2s, because this movie does not deserve it.

","Something new is never bad when it comes to comic books, but riding the waves of other successes works too, cause nothing says there has to be a change, maybe one and that's vision. It would be a mistake to think that Disney has no idea what it's doing. They know they need to keep the comic book wave alive and grab new viewers and Guardians of the Galaxy is perfect for doing just that. The new blood infusion comes from James Gunn the script writer, he's proved himself all geek with Super and Slither. Neither were outstanding pieces, but both were entertaining and very funny. But what did he end up doing with a big project and what can we even expect from him? Based on the first trailers it looks like the year's biggest blockbuster even if the Guardians don't have a strong foundation like the Avengers. Though it is a popular comic, it's not as known a brand as Thor and gang. But as more and more trailers came out and info was leaked expectations rose. The hype machine was churning. So only one question remains. Can they jump the huge hurdle that they built? Lássuk a sztorit: After stealing a mysterious orb in the far reaches of outer space, Peter Quill, a half human/half alien is now the main target of a manhunt lead by the villain known as Ronan the Accuser. To help fight Ronan and his team and save the galaxy from his power, Quill creates a team known as the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' to save the world. First off it's a visually pleasing action, the story is fast paced, but between two action scenes there is time for character development. It's finally not a problem that there are a lot of heroes in the story and they don't know what to do with them. They all have their place. The story may not be all that, but there aren't major problems with it either and the one liners are great. I laughed myself silly at the teasing going on between the characters. They constantly have a go at each other. The script is definitely designed to have the jokes and the characters as its focal point. And that's not a bad thing. It's entertaining. The films music is awesome, we hear a bit of it in the trailers but it works really well in the film, despite it seeming to be not suitable to a film like this. It totally pulled off what few would have thought possible jumping that proverbial hurdle. But hey with a film with a raccoon sitting on a moving tree while said raccoon machine guns everything in sight you kind of know that it will be huge. But the point I'm trying to make is that Hollywood finally came up with a good script. It's good visually but for me it was a comedy. I for one laughed more than with many of the so called comedies that came out in the last little while. Disney has reached the high point in Marvel films. So the question remains what now? It might sound strange but Guardians has totally given Avengers 2 a new hurdle to jump over. Marvel films stayed high quality this is true but they didn't have any daring, guts to them and that's what Guardians has. I think the film will be a huge success and that's good for a lot of reasons. Hopefully Disney will continue to be brave with the Marvel rights and will dip into some more interesting projects beside the new Captain America. All in all the film gives what can be expected maybe even more. I was counting on it being a visually pleasing fast paced action sci-fi with humor, but it was a surprise how good the actors were, the characters were and the script was. So it became the best Marvel film and that I wasn't expecting. It surprised me. It can't be less than a 10/10.

","Guardians of the Galaxy showcases all of Marvel's talents with an intriguing, exciting plot,relatable characters and some pretty sweet action sequences. But with Guardians they added a new ingredient to the bowl with a big fistful of comedy and I loved that. First of the characters. Chris Pratt as Starlord is a witty, brave and cool protagonist. His character is the most fleshed out out of the five Guardians. Zoe Saldana as Gamora was a good fit. She had a tough edge as well as mind of composure and her chemistry with Starlord gave a hint of romance into the story. I was however hoping to find out more about her but her back story wasn't explained entirely. Bradley Cooper as Rocket and Vin Diesel as GROOT stole the show for me. The pair together interacting was hilarious and Rocket was even wittier than Starlord. GROOT had a couple of touching moments in the film and conflict,heart and humour were used brilliantly in the movie. My gripes with the movie was the villain Ronan. He was a functional villain but his storyline was condensed plus he is belittled by a more powerful force in the film. Drax another guardian was functional but his characters pain didn't shine through. Overall Guardians is an insanely fun time with good action from an unknown comic book. It's what Marvel do I guess.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

","Looking at the Guardians themselves and it is abundantly clear that Marvel still has the ability to introduce new, interesting characters to the fold. Chris Pratt's 'Star Lord' is the studios' most instantly likable and charismatic lead since Tony Stark back in Iron Man I, and the rest are just as captivating. Gamora acts as the perfect foil to Quill's flamboyance whilst the fact that Drax can only take things literally is a fountain of comedy throughout as well as showcasing an excellently subtle amount of character progression as the film progresses. However it is the almost Han Solo-Chewbacca axis with Groot and Rocket that provides the most laughs as well as emotional depth. Groot is incredibly lovable, if challenged linguistically, and Rocket is the pessimistic, criminal genius that proves that this band of heroes isn't quite as squeaky clean as Marvel's earlier characters.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

There are references to Peter's reputation as a ladies' man and jokes about his past conquests; Peter and Gamora also have a lot of chemistry and almost kiss a couple of times. Language isn't frequent but includes ""s--t,"" ""bulls--t,"" ""bitch,"" ""ass,"" ""bastard,"" and ""d--k""; at one point, the Guardians also drink an unidentified liquid that makes them drunk.

The group of heroes does not have that much tension as it should have.

No second thoughts, no tension.
We are not introduced to any of the heroes and/or villains thoroughly - we can see that Peter's mother died when he was young... And then what? Apparently, there is more to the story of every character, but we get only partial information and only to the end of the movie.
Then we have some blue villains and shooting starships, and all the generic sci-fi stuff, which is great... But this has been seen before (even the story with the powerful artifact and villain from another planet is not that uncommon, last time we have seen it, was Thor: Dark World, which was a just two movies before this in the series).
So yeah, for this movie to be something more, the characters would have to be more believable. And I don't blame the actors, I blame the scriptwriters.

","Well I've just got back from cinema and I have to say that I am definitely hooked on a feeling - and that feeling is that this film is awesome! Right from the first sequence you are hooked and instantly charmed by Peter Quill as he scavenges for an artifact - an opening act which instantly sets the light-hearted tone of the movie and witty writing makes this character one of the best of the Marvel universe to hit the big screen - even possibly surpassing Tony Stark...! The movie doesn't mess around and you're quickly introduced to the rest of the gang and that's where it ups a notch or two - the bickering between the characters is fantastically well written and continues to progress and develop all of the characters as the film goes on. The group dynamic between the 5 heroes is also brilliantly portrayed and by the end you really feel that the characters care for each other - most notably a tree and a raccoon! As with all the Marvel films the action sequences and special effects are great and, if you haven't already, then get your geek on because Thanos is in the movie! (Ooh! Aah!) I know there is already a sequel in the plans but I can easily see a trilogy for the Guardians already. Unlike most Marvel movies there is always a thought in the back of your mind that there are other superheroes out there, certainly in the phase two movies you can't help wondering where the other avengers are - but this film you completely forget about them and at times forget it is a Marvel film at all - it's actually a great standalone sci-fi movie! The casting for the film is spot on; Chris Pratt - never heard of him before this film but think he has a great future ahead of him, Zoe Saldana continues to show her acting talents, Bradley Cooper brings a soul to a gun toting Racoon, Dave Bautista uses all of his acting skills picked up from his wrestling days and Vin Diesel fits perfectly in as Groot (I am resisting any temptation to make a reference to wooden acting...).

","Guardians of the Galaxy has a great team up situation, Gamora is retrieving the orb from Star Lord, while Star Lord is trying to sell it, Rocket and Groot the humanoid tree are collecting a bounty put on Star Lord. Star Lord had a bounty on him because he return the orb that he retrieved to his master. Gamora plans to betray her master Ronan an outraged Kree warrior who works for Thanos who will eventually be the main villain throughout the new MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe). He is after all the infinity stones for those who have watched previous Marvel movies the ether contains an infinity stone, the Power stone. The Stone contained within the orb is the Space stone. The stone in Loki's Sceptre is the mind stone. The tesseract also has an infinity stone inside. Thanos needs to play a more important part or people will just lose interest because in all Marvel movie to date he sits in a floating chair, except in Avengers Age of Ultron he is wearing his Infinity gauntlet which will hold all the Infinity stones. The final battle has great visual effects. Ronan is attacking Xandar the main planet of the system they live in. The Xandarian army form a blockade with their ships, Ronan's Kree warship eventually destroyed the Xandarian defense force. Gamora, Star Lord, Rocket and Groot were sent to prison earlier in the story line and that were the met Drax a strong fighter who wants to kill Ronan. They come together to defeat Ronan in his plan to destroy pretty much everything, and form the Guardians of the Galaxy. Unfortunately Groot sacrifices himself to save the rest of them. As Groot is a tree Rocket collected his remains and planted them in a pot and he can grow back, which is great they can use that to and advantage because he can't die.

Luckily, the movie does a solid enough job with its characters to keep most of the humor feeling organic. The action, though vivid, tends to drag.

1221,31 August 2020,frostyfrog,7," Guardians Of The Galaxy
","Guardians Of The Galaxy is just a pure fun sci-fi summer blockbuster that blindsided many people when it came out. Not many people expected it to have the success that it did mostly due to the fact that these characters were very obscure in Marvel lore. That obscurity gave the writers a chance to introduce for the first time on the silver screen five really relatable characters to root for, each with their own arc. The fun loving and bumbling Star Lord is a character who was abducted from earth and raised by a bunch of outcasts. At first, he like another Guardian was only in it for the money. However the film has him Bond with the others and begin to see that the value of life is more important. Gamora is the daughter of the Mad Titan Thanos who is only interested in stopping Ronan and her father from using the power stone to cause harm. Throughout the film she is a loner but her arc mostly revolves around learning to work with others. Rocket is not a raccoon to himself but we'll call him that. He was in it for the money and had no interest towards bonding with others. His character was the most interesting from this film, he was the last to join the group in the climatic battle and arguably he was the most stubborn. His arc not just centered around trying to learn the value in working with others but actually befriending them as well. His partner Groot loved people and by the way he is Groot. Groot's arc perfectly coincided with Rocket's in that he wanted Rocket to help others and was willing to make sacrifices to ensure that Rocket would. Groot's place in the Guardians created the emotional epicenter of the film. Drax, the last of the Guardians was a killer on a path to avenge the death of his wife and family. However after crossing paths with the other Guardians, needed to learn to work with them and not allow his grudge to get him killed. These are all five simple arcs that sum up the plot as a group of misfits trying to work with each other to stop a madman from using a power to conquer a world. Not an unfamiliar plot at all but the writing used to make the Guardians such realistic characters really helped make it feel fresh. Unfortunately that writing didn't save Ronan the accuser from being a pretty bland nothing of a villain. Roman's arc wasn't about anything other than being hungry for power over the Xandarians. No reasons why aside from the fact that they called him crazy this one time. Despite this though, this film is a summer blockbuster so I can forgive a slightly formulaic plot and bland villain based on the kind of movie this is. This movie is pure fun whether it's Star Lord dancing to ""Come And Get Your Love"" in the opening credits, to Rocket having Star Lord steal some guy's leg as a prank, to Yondu using his arrow to annihilate Roman's soldiers, and Star Lord challenging Ronan to a dance off just as he's about to commit global genocide. There are so many notable moments, sequences and songs in this film and if I'm being honest, this film has the best soundtrack of any Marvel film to date. Yes, there's some generic score music but the writers very much have you more keyed in on Star Lord's Walkman sound track. ""Ooh Child"", ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"", and ""Hooked On A Feeling"" are just a few classics the film throws at you in creative ways to. For example, ""Hooked On A Feeling"" plays as Star Lord is being sprayed with a hose and you get to see... Those abs... Oh my. ANYWAYS, speaking of seeing things, the visual effects were very impressive, especially for the characters of Rocket and Groot. Rocket Raccoon looked like a real raccoon that could pick up a gun and blow somebody's fuckin' head off. Groot looked like a real sentient tree that smiled after annihilating an entire wave of Ronan goons. I think what really keeps this film going are the performances, even though Chris Pratt played himself. Is that a bad thing? No, the man is incredibly funny and did a great job, especially when the Guardians held hands at the climatic sequence. The other Guardians were unrecognizable as their alien characters. Actually I take that back, I can recognize Vin Diesel's mumbling anywhere but aside from him my statement stays the same. Bradley Cooper as Rocket in particular blew me away as I didn't know he had such a great range as an actor. From country singer to a bipolar eagle's fan to a talking raccoon, is there anything that man can't do? On a side note by the way, I loved Benicio Del Toro as the collector, he was unhinged as hell. I honestly wished he played a bigger role in the grand scheme of the MCU but to each their own I guess. Last but not least, the pacing was pretty solid as well. You could say that there were some scenes that may not have seemed to be needed in the film but I would be willing to counteract by saying that it is those scenes that help build the Guardians character. At the end of the day, Guardians Of The Galaxy is a fun summer sci-fi adventure that does lack a compelling villain and contain a few formulaic plot elements but it also has enough going for it for me to say it is one of the better Marvel movies to watch. While it wasn't as fresh as The Winter Soldier was, it certainly was just as fun. I'm gonna give the Guardians Of The Galaxy a 7 out of 10.

So you what you get in here is non-complex writing (I was 50/50 annoyed and amused by this through out the flick) and recently so liberal PG style bloodless violence. The movie felt to me as a mix between Star Wars franchise and Fantastic 4, with no potential to grow his own sequels (well if it will choose to grow with his audience, that could bring it to a new level). Visuals were top notch. Pacing was great. I won't be judging acting on this one. All in all great entertainment for any age, but most suitable for a family night out.

The setting is a bit muddled and the action quite hectic however, this film's imperfections are what makes it so good. Peter, Drax, Rocket, Gamora and Groot are all awesome and have funny moments, but most importantly- you feel conmected to the characters' backgrounds and interested.

","This is my personal review of Guardians of the Galaxy and it is a brilliant movie by doing this Marvel has expanded its universe. The first thing to note is that the introduction is very sad because peter's mother dies from cancer, he is then taken by aliens away from earth. The storyline picks up twenty six years later on a planet which contains the orb, this holds the purple infinity gem which in the comics controls space.Then it leads to all the main characters excluding Drax to a secure prison. All members including Drax escape from prison and go to sell the orb to the collector. However this turns out bad because Drax calls Ronan telling them the location because he wants to avenge the deaths of his family members. The story leads to Ronan having the infinity stone and the guardians of the galaxy need to save the day. This is part of Marvel's phase two movies but is helping to set the up phase three because it has characters such as Thonas which is apart of the storyline. My personal view is that this movie is very well directed and has a very good storyline James Gunn has done a brilliant job and should direct more movies.

Yes, at that time I was completely confused on what exactly that was. Because up to that point, we already had a good idea of who Iron Man was, who Thor was, who Captain America was and so on. But GOTG was something that seemed a bit more obscure and it sure was. I think Marvel made a really big risk because of that, but somehow it all actually worked out. The film became super successful in the box office and got great reviews, proving that any movie with Marvel's logo slapped on it will make lots of money. Now even though this film was largely successful, when I went to go see it at the movie theater I was actually a little disappointed.

However, I did enjoy the scene in which they break out of the space prison. I thought that the space battle near the end was average, I've seen a lot better e.g. Star Wars. The main protagonists were very well developed, especially Star Lord, I like his character a lot. I didn't like Drax very much, as I thought that most aspects of his personality were too over the top. The special effects were amazing, as expected from a Marvel movie.

It began strong, even if the blue daughter of Thanos was rather spastic in her acting, hammy even. Then the inevitable romance blossomed, which began its decline into clichéd plot lines.

","I was quite sceptical when first sitting down to watch this movie as I did not think it would be of my taste however I was pleasantly surprised! Guardians of the galaxy is a fun, light hearted movie but has managed to provide a serious super hero aspect also. The characters are fascinating in so many ways, from the simplicity of Groot to the complicated life of 'star lord'. The way in which 'star lord' enters the the beyond is dark and sets that scene from the start of the movie but with a jump from adolescence to adulthood we soon realise this is a different kind of movie with a fantastic main character. Chris Pratt seemed a suitable actor to deliver a performance that required an aspect of seriousness and comic with the not so impressive hard men Vin Diesel and Batista playing the roles that required lesser acting skills. The mysterious Gamora was compelling however the main villain not so compelling but well suited to the light heartiness of the movie. The fantastic soundtrack from the 60's and 70's which has a deeper meaning of which you will find out from watching the movie was refreshing even if they are from an older generation. The movie provided a fantastic imaginary view on outer space with the usual weird and wonderful communities and species a sci-fi movie provides. This is a great marval piece and is definitely keeping up with all the other marvel movies being released.

","""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is the movie we've all been waiting for. It combines a pleasant mix of comedy and action to give us what many believe, including I, that this is Marvel studios best film to date. From the perfect cast to the engrossing story, this film is one of the best and should go down as one of the best superhero movies to hit the big screen. Chris Pratt is perfect as Star-Lord, a brash young adventurer, born on Earth, but taken as a young boy when his mother passed away. He sees himself at odds with an evil ruler known as Ronan the Accuser when he tries to steal an orb containing an infinity stone, yes that's right, an infinity stone. Fate then leads him to meet up with the daughter of Thanos, Gamora, two thugs trying to collect their due, Groot and Rocket, and finally a revenge driven maniac known as Drax, who is in my opinion one of the brightest surprises of the film. They then must put aside their differences and team up to stop Ronan and his army from using the infinity stone to wipe out the galaxy. Now if I was forced to point out a negative I would say that the villains are a bit under developed but that's about it.

This movie as we all know will have a sequel. There is excess footage after the credits roll, so stay for a few minutes. You will love the soundtrack. It's from the 1970-1980's. Peter's mother made him the mix tapes. There are some secrets you need to watch for and some surprises that are revealed. This movie will tie into ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" and ""Avengers 3"" (rumored) You know how Kevin Feige is with his work. James Gunn did an amazing job with writing and directing this film and this blended cast is perfect. With some foreshadowing that writers love doing, I believe ""Thanos"" voiced by Josh Brolin, has some darkness appealing to his character and there is some heaviness playing in the Marvel Universe literally when it comes to Phase 3.

","This film is an amazing film. One reason being is the animation is phenomenal. Not only is the CGI great, but the movie implements make up on most of the cast. This is nice to see since a lot of films these days use CGI for their characters. The story is very good, yet the reason why I'm giving an 8.5 instead of a perfect 10 is because at some points you feel the story is being rushed and kind of jumbled, it is not rushed too badly nor jumbled a lot, just feels like it sometimes. The character interaction within the team is wonderful. You really get a feel of the characters personality and how they at first do not want to work together. As the film progresses you can see the character development within the characters and how they treat each other with respect and consider each other as true friends. The film does a good job with humor and action. It is good for an action lover and a comedy fan as well. Also one thing about this film that is nice is that it is not based on Earth. (All the Marvel Universe films are based on Earth) This film is based on other planets. I loved that! I felt like I was watching an awesome Science Fiction film set in new worlds and felt like I was discovering new planets. To be honest I felt like it was a weird hybrid of Star Trek meets Marvel. The different alien species and humans living on the different planets is an awesome welcome. Even if the film was set on Earth, still would be a good film. Overall this films animation/CGI, balance of action and humor, and a great character development gives this film a good balance.

","excellent movie...the music nd the performances are very good..its a must watch for me. Guardians of the Galaxy is nothing short of an amazing movie.

Not only does it have the impressive set pieces and enough action to last you a lifetime, it has an emotional core and you actually get to care about each and every single character. Overall this movie is filled with all the required thrills and spills and is a first class action movie. It also has a great mixture of comedic value and a deal of seriousness.

","I must tart by saying that after I red the reviews of this movie, I had high expectations. In my opinion, this is a clearly overrated movie. It doesn't even explain why Peter Quill left earth after her mother died. Why did they capture him? Just because their parents had something special? That should be answered during the movie, and it was not. I believe that marvel fans know the reason, but in my case I don't and I believe many people that are going to watch the movie, will not get it as well. Second, I must say: TOO MUCH CGI ruins a movie. This was a good example. They used a lot of CGI and it was not that good. I saw people here talking about the CGI being flawless, but those people clearly haven't seen Christopher Nolan's movies. To end my review, I should say that I enjoyed the last scene where they hold hands together to become ""immortal"" while holding the infinite stone. It was a good scene, even though when Peter Quill starts dancing in front of the villain is kind of stupid.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

The main thing your supposed to see is the theme about family. How your friends can be your family. The villain was weak but once again the film isn't centered around him. He's just there to move things forward. The beginning at ending were very emotional and I didn't cry at the end (I don't ever cry during movies) but it did make eyes teary.

I felt like he was supposed to be some tough guy, quick witted character, but came off as just some annoying rodent. I honestly feel like if Danny Mcbride could replace Bradley Cooper, and not do a bostonish type accent(thats what it seemed to me at least), and allow dialogue that would make the rating of the movie an R rating, the movie would have been much better. I know I am being picky, but rocket had that much of an effect on how I felt about this movie, which I feel rarely happens.

Now I'm not calling for porn but if the arrival scene at the prison called for Star-Lord to be shown half naked from various angles they should have done the exact same views and angles on Gamora. I also noticed typically (scene with Stan Lee) that if a much older man is talking to a younger female he's called a perv but when it's the other way around they do everything but give the woman an award. Setting all double standards aside it was real good. Great music and special effects with good doses of humor. I loved the headgear and suit that Star-Lord had.

","'Guardians of the Galaxy,' or 'Weird Avengers' as I heard a kid in my theater describe it, is Marvel's first big adventure into the weird, (but it won't be the last if the end credits scene pays off). Now this movie could've been a hilariously awful flop, i.e. 'After Earth', but where other recent Star Wars wannabes, i.e. 'John Carter', have failed, 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is a fresh new adventure series that takes the best elements of Star Wars, Firefly, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and surprisingly even Howard the Duck. Now, it's no 'Avengers' and it's certainly weird as heck, but under all that weirdness is a charm. A charm missing in recent flops, i.e. John Carter or After Earth. It's that charm that helps me forgive some of the 'Phantom Menace'-esque dialogue about peace treaties and other stuff I couldn't care less about. Much of that charm is provided by Chris Pratt as Jason Quill, or Star- Lord. Jason Quill is to 'GotG' what Tony Stark is to 'Iron Man.' Star-Lord could've been a completely boring piece of wood, i.e. Thor, but he takes all the charm of Chris Pratt and adds in that Iron Man sass. But the real stars of this film are Rocket Raccoon and Groot. Oh. My. God. These two may be the best Marvel movie characters ever. I would watch an entire trilogy of just them. Rocket is almost like Joe Pesci in 'Goodfellas' and Groot is just one big puppy dog (who violently murders people). They are the Han and Chewie of this movie, only that they are a talking raccoon and a weird tree. Everyone else was just fine. Bautista has gotten flack for being a 'bad actor,' but he's perfectly fine and has several of the movie's funniest scenes. Zoe Saldana is okay, but she's really just playing Zoe Saldana. The villain, Ronan, has been getting flack for being weak, but Marvel movies never have great villains, apart from Loki. He works in the movie and I at least remember his name unlike whoever the villain was in Thor 2. Overall, 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is a really fun mix of sci-fi and adventure that doesn't take itself too seriously, which is much needed in these dark days of 'Man of Steel.'

","This was my favorite film of 2014. When I saw the trailer, I asked myself how any movie with a talking raccoon and tree in ""space"" could be good, but I was wrong. That so called tree's name was Groot, and he was my favorite character. I think that what I liked about this movie is its variety of genres. The soundtrack consisted of some of the best all time songs, and the director had those songs played at the perfect moments. I found myself in tears more than once,(beginning when star lord's mom is dying, when Groot dies, and when star lord discover the second mix-tape his mom has left him) and laughing seconds later. My favorite scene was when The Guardians are close to death and Groot knows he is the only thing that can save them. Throughout the entire movie the only words he says are ""i am Groot"", yet in this scene, while his fellow guardians are wrapped in his branches, his last words are ""We are Groot"" This scene was so emotional which shows a lot considering it involved a talking tree. I also liked a lot of Star Lord's scenes because his character was so humerus. There is not one flaw that comes to mind when i think about Guardians of the galaxy, and I think it is a movie that everyone needs to see.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

","This movie is not better than the avengers. This movie is not better than Captain America 2. This is not the best Marvel movie. This may conflict with a lot of people's opinions, but its true. I wanted to adore this movie. I could picture it at the top of my top 10 movies of the year list. I was practicing what i'd say in my review video on YouTube. Then i saw the movie. Don't get me wrong, it was a great movie. Very enjoyable. But nothing that new or original, which is what i desperately wanted from this movie: to be something completely new that we'd never seen before. The best thing about this movie are the characters. While some, Gamora, are never really built upon as much as others and some, Drax, do become very dull at times, they are all interesting characters. Part of what people were complementing James Gunn about was setting up all these characters in one movie as opposed to Joss Whedon, who worked with characters that had already been established in several movies beforehand. At sometimes, the development is great: i especially liked a scene in which Rocket Raccoon had an emotional breakdown. However, Drax's obsession with finding Ronan eventually became a bore and i got sick of it pretty quickly. Rocket and Groot were great, although i thought that they weren't really shown as having that trademark friendship that they have in the comics. The relationship was there at some specific scenes, although most of the time Rocket thought that Groot was acting stupid, insulting him and using him solely for muscle. Chris Pratt as Star Lord was the best performance in the movie, and he brought a lot of charisma to the character. My main problem was the generic plot. This plot felt like it had been recycled from the Avengers, or any generic team based movie. There's that signature moment where all the team members are defeated and scattered (like in the avengers) only to have them spurred into action again. They start off hating each other and end up being best friends. There is literally a scene where Groot takes out a group of bad guys in a hallway that was basically the same as the Hulk/Loki scene in the Avengers. Don't fix something that isn't broken i guess, but i hoped for something more original. I also think the end credit scene was a massive kick in the balls for anyone expecting something epic to hold them over to Avengers 2. James Gunn hyped it up so much i was really looking forward to it, and it ended up just being a joke. Literally. While i have these complaints, i must say that this movie is enjoyable. Its a good first step into the Marvel cosmos universe, but i hope the issues can be improved upon in the future sequels.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

","By far, one of the most anticipated movies of the year. Marvel took a massive risk making this movie as these characters weren't as well known compared to others such as Iron Man or Captain America. So, did Guardians of the Galaxy pay off? Yes. This has been declared as the best movie of 2014, some even calling it one of the best sci-fi's and compared to classics like Empire Strikes Back and Blade Runner along with being regarded as one of the best comic book movies. Where I would disagree, I can understand why people would praise it so much. The direction is stellar (considering this is from the guy who directed Movie 43). The effects are tremendous and the cinematography is brilliant. The script is emotional, hilarious and is just amazing. Chris Pratt is outstanding and has definitely proved himself as an actor by bringing Starlord to life and his performance could some day be as classic and iconic as Han Solo's, or the Terminator's. Zoe Saldana and Dave Batista were both great in their roles and Vin Diesel did a good job at doing the motion-capture for Groot. Then there's Rocket, voiced by Bradley Cooper. By far, without a sliver of a doubt, steals the show. When I heard someone compare Rocket to Heath Ledger's Joker as I was leaving the cinema, I couldn't help but agree. The weakest part of this movie however is the villain, Ronan. He didn't seem to have a motive and I don't consider him a character, instead a vessel. Also some of the jokes and humor felt like forced Marvel humor. With that aside, this movie is really fun. Whoever you are, you will like this movie and I believe it gives Avengers Assemble a run for its money and is the 3rd best movie I've seen this year (2nd Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, 1st Edge of Tomorrow) scoring Guardians of the Galaxy a 9 out of 10",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

Thankfully when the movie actually got going it was really good, anyway all that said this movie is definitely worth watching and shouldn't be missed, especially if you like nostalgia as epic is the only word in my opinion to describe the awesomeness of the nostalgic sound track which accompanies this movie. There hasn't really been a sound track as good as this in a while. I also feel the storyline is well thought out and the acting is carried out with some good talent.

","I just watch the movie in theater recently and it was OK. Yup, you don't want your movie to be 'ok', at least 'bad' define something. What the movie lacks are concentration and structures. The story is largely interesting with every characters have their own struggles and unique identities. However, the way the movie portrays them is very predictable and somehow a bit juvenile. The animation values are very visible here that they make it less realistic and approachable. Some of the comedies are quite hilarious but a bit predictable and too much. Comedy doesn't have to be loud. Those flaws just make the movie lacks tension and seriousness. Most of it is trying to appeal the mass audience with those commercial values.

Peter Quill teams up with Gamora, Drax, Rocket and Groot, after certain more or less unfortunate circumstances, in hope of stopping the evil villain (too cheesy?) Ronan The Accuser. Underway they run into problems in different location, such as a prison escape. The aesthetics in the movie is quite good.

The cast is superb, from Chris Pratt to Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper to Karen Gillan (Amy Pond in Doctor Who). Indeed, Gillan was a truly unexpected gem as Nebula (and she actually shaved her head for the role!). She might even have stolen the show for me, if not for Cooper's portrayal of Rocket, the genetically altered, cybernetic enhanced raccoon. This movie was breathtakingly funny, and the visuals were, to say the least, stunning. The space battles, the splendid makeup, the fully realized environments. I could go on and on. Fans of Farscape will, I think, see a lot of John Crichton in Chris Pratt's bumbling, exasperated ""Star Lord."" With just a dash of Malcolm Reynolds. And that's only the tip of the cultural-reference iceberg. This is a smart, sassy, witty film, and it's utterly over-the-top ridiculous. And sexy. It might wind up being my favorite film of the year.

Their crown jewel, The Avengers, put the whole gang in one big flying fortress and then burned down the box-office to the tune of around a billion and a half in ticket sales. As well as the Disney/Marvel juggernaut, Sony has Spidey and the five movies he's starred in, Fox has the X-Men and around a half-dozen movies of varying quality and Warner Brothers has Batman, a phenomenon unto himself with Superman occasionally showing up in various combinations of performer and tone.

It's the kind of film that sucks you in from start to finish (which, of course, you'll want to stay for the end of the credits, as with all Marvel movies). I truly cannot wait for this movie to come out on DVD. The acting was great and the dialog was fantastic. We were laughing the whole way through. Chris Pratt was fantastic as Peter Quill. He really is a master of his craft with perfect comedic timing, not to mention he's rugged and charming, in the same vein of Han Solo, with a much bigger sense of humor.

1446,12 September 2018,bezzacat,9," Guardians of the galaxy film review
","Guardians of the Galaxy was a big chance for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I grew up reading comic books; I started collecting them when they were only 15 cents. My aunt and I would walk three blocks to a drugstore; it was hard to find comic books when I was five years old. One thing the Marvel Cinematic Universe has done and done well is keeping the same main running theme that Marvel comics always had running through all their books. It is ok to be different. Whether it was the teenage troubles of Spiderman, racial tensions expressed in the X-men, or the Loneliness and Vulnerability of the Hulk all of them shared one thing in common in some way they are outsiders. The Guardians of the Galaxy reinforces that theme stronger than any of the other Marvel films. It tells us it is ok to be different with a strong message of together we stand and divided we fall thrown in for good measure.
 Guardians of the Galaxy plot-wise is a pretty average superhero genre film with a very undeveloped and underwhelming villain. He only serves as a conflict that forces our heroes to cooperate. It would be a pretty average film if not for the well-developed characters and the relationships between them. When the film starts, we are introduced to the films central hero Peter Jason Quill aka Starlord when he is a boy. His mother is dying, and Peter doesn't dare to face it when he flees the hospital, and he is collected by an alien craft. Next, we pick up with an older Starlord in a scene that vaguely resembles the first sequence of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Starlord is on a desolate planet moving his way through rabbit creatures in a dark, dreary cave to collect an artifact. What it does differently is put our protagonist dancing his way to his goal while listening to ""Come and get your love"" on his Sony Walkman. Starlord has betrayed his pirate clan the Ravagers by stealing the artifact for himself. The leader of the Ravagers Yondu vows to kills Starlord for his disobedience. 
I did a lot of thinking about the characters in this film and their oddities. One by one we are introduced to each of the characters that will form the Guardians of the Galaxy. Starlord is an emotionally distance selfish rogue when we first meet up with him. His powers are smooth talking, seduction, technical gadgets, piloting, and music. Yes, that's right, music may be the single most important part of this character. Starlord is also the stereotypical dumb witted dude character at times for humor. Each of the guardians has oddities that play off each other for great comic effect. Their differences are ultimately what makes them shine. Gamora is the most dangerous woman in the galaxy. She is the adopted daughter, not by her choice, of Thanos the archvillain of the Marvel Cinematic Universe who wishes to impose his form of justice on the universe. Her powers are the mastery of all types of combat. She is an assassin, but she hides a very vulnerable side. When we first meet Gamora, she is working for the villain of the film Ronan the Accursar. Ronan sends the daughters of Thanos Gamora and Nebula to retrieve the artifact that Starlord stole. Ronan has promised to retrieve the artifact for Thanos in return for the destruction of the race of people called the Xandarians. Rocket Raccoon is a talking raccoon that is a master of ranged weapons and explosives; he is also a very good pilot. Rocket has the essence of a raccoon, clever and mischievous. He also has the qualities of other small mammals like ferrets as he is drawn to collecting things and has a love for money. Bradley Cooper gives Rocket a warmth and humor that brings the character to life. Humor is a big part of Rocket's personality. What does a raccoon need to keep it safe? A tree of course. The character Groot is a large tree creature that is paired up with Rocket when we are introduced to them. I think Groot keeps the guardians together and holds the Guardians together in their darkest moment in this film. He always seems to save the day by manipulating his body to get the job done. He has a very similar relationship to Rocket that Chewbacca has to Han Solo. Groot can only say ""I am Groot"" so there are hilarious one character conversations between Rocket and Groot where Rocket is filling in the blanks with his dialogue. Rocket and Groot are motivated by greed; they are bounty hunters when we meet them trying to collect a bounty on Starlord. Our heroes are so selfish and dim-witted that they battle over the artifact in public on the heavy police planet Xandar and get arrested. In a space prison, they meet the last of the Guardians Drax the Destroyer. It's interesting because I have read comics with Drax in them. In those days Drax wore a purple cape, was able to fly and was able to blast energy from his hands. I like the changes Marvel made with the character. Drax is a brute; he has super strength and endurance. He is deadly with the dual knives that he carries. He carries darkness in his soul from the murder of his wife and daughter. Drax is played by the ex-professional wrestler Dave Bautista. Professional wrestlers and athletes don't always do well on the big screen, but by the way Drax is written Dave Bautista does a marvelous job. Drax does not understand the complexities of language; he can't comprehend metaphors which creates humorous situations in the film. Drax is very straight-faced and serious even when he is trying to be funny. The Guardians must put aside their selfish differences to escape from the prison. Each of them must utilize the strengths of their oddities to make their plan work. They take the artifact to a villain in the Marvel Comics Universe named the Collector. He identifies the artifact as an infinity stone. There are only five infinity stones in the universe; they can't even be held by a mortal without deathly consequence. Through an act of selfishness Ronan locates our heroes. The stone is lost to Ronan because the Guardians are not co-operating. The Guardians are not prepared for Ronan's attack. The Guardians are forced to use mining vessels as weapons against Ronan's army of Necrophages. They are not working well together and are separated from each other. Nebula and Gamora have a long feud fueled and fanned by their evil father, Thanos. Nebula is able to best Gamora, who has the infinity stone, in starship to starship combat. Gamora is left floating in space to die. This is where the turning point in the movie is. The conflict in this movie is both internal and external. The main conflict being the heroes' inability to get along. Starlord and Gamora have been wrestling with romantic tension from the first time they met. Starlord leaves his ship and gives Gamora his face breather so she will live but he will die. Gamora and Starlord are rescued by the Ravagers. When Starlord makes the sacrifice for something, he loves things start to change for our heroes. They are able to convince the Ravagers to join them to stop Ronan. We then see one of the most impressive scenes in the film as the Guardians finally come together recognizing they are all outcasts and need each other. They hatch a complicated plan to stop Ronan who now is using the infinity stone to bolster his powers. I am not going into detail because you need to see it for yourself. This movie was created to be entertaining. It is very successful in its goal. The movie is a special effects extravaganza with great characterization showcasing its troubled misfit characters. Though out the film we are shown over and over that these characters are very odd. They are losers, they are misfits, they are freaks, and no one else wants them, they are alone until they find each other. Each character is odd in their unique way. Each character's oddity rubs against the other characters. It is only at the point that they accept reality and realize they have a lot in common that things start to get better for them. It is through their uniqueness and differences that they shine. Each character has a tragic story that has left them alone at some point in their lives.
 Guardians of the Galaxy isn't free of flaws. It borrows from a lot of films. It is a mix match of Star Wars and the Goonies. I can see the character Han Solo in Starlord and Rocket Raccoon. Rocket does the same thing as Han Solo does with Chewbacca when he has one-sided conversations with Groot. Gamora reminds me a lot of the Princess Leia of the Empire Strikes Back. There is a scene between Starlord and Gamora that reminds me of the restrained sexual tension between Han Solo and Princess Leia in the Empire Strikes Back. Drax is a direct play at humor that goes all the way back to Abbott and Costello. The use of differences in dialect set up deadpan jokes frequently. The actors are chosen for their roles because they are playing characters that strongly suit their personality traits. Bradley Cooper impresses me the most by creating a loveable angst filled trash talking Rocket Raccoon. Chris Pratt plays Chris Pratt in all the movies I see him in, and he does it very well. Zoe Saldana is beautiful and has a lovely voice. Her looks and demeanor are direct ironies to the nature of the character she plays to set her up as being odd. Dave Bautista fits the physical presence of Drax, Drax is an unemotional deadpan character that often sets up humor. Vin Diesel plays Groot who only says, ""I am Groot."" I get the same feeling watching this as I do when I watch a film like the Goonies which is a story about a group of misfit kids going on an adventure. You can make an argument that Star Wars is the same movie as well. Star Wars is about a group of misfits who can't get along that is set against an unstoppable force. You could draw the line that in Star Wars our heroes get trapped in a trash compactor and in the Guardians of the Galaxy our heroes get put in prison. There are many scenes and parallels between the first three Star Wars films and the Guardians of the Galaxy.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014
1447,16 April 2015,dalisvanscoy,10," Lesson Learned.
","I absolutely loved this movie. It has a certain lesson through out the whole movie. It teaches us how we should all work together, no matter how much we may hate, and or dislike the person we are forced to work with. It also teaches us that we should never judge a book by its cover. Because sometimes you never know what someones past is like until you ask them and learn more about their past, and learn more about them as a person. Also, I think that this movie has excellent graphics, a wonderful story line, and I just love how adventurous it is. I think that this movie is a wonderful movie to watch with your family, VERY children friendly. If I had children, I'd make them watch this movie because they would learn a lesson from it, the lesson I stated above.

Good choice of songs used throughout, and the whole plot of it is just amazing. I was really sceptical about it when I saw t in cinemas think it was going to be a movie like the avengers, but even though they are both created by marvel and is both a "" superhero gang"" it is very different from the avengers. There is some use of language but it is not over used and being a 12 you can expect that. The character have their own back story and it is very well used in the plot. The whole story is explained well and how they came together is also explained well. It is a movie that I would definitely recommended to anyone. Dancing Groot is definitely something you need to look out for,mo believe it is one of the best parts of the movie. The songs are like retro 60s music, but are songs that everyone has heard of, you will be singing the song for 10 days straight. Really funny and an overall great movie.

And Chris Pratt, he is what you would expect him to be, but it doesn't mean a bad thing, because I don't think that no one would be more appropriate for the role of Star-Lord. He is funny as always in GotG too. The story that Gunn has brought together is both compelling and makes you curious. As for the scenes, you can expect what you can expect from a Marvel film and multiply it with 10 times and add some Star Wars awesomeness to it, and there you have the Guardians of the Galaxy.

I think that the story line is very clever with lots of humour. Humour is the key thing which makes this film so very decent. I enjoyed it. I actually purchased this on DVD rather than using other methods of watching this film because it is so booming. Chris Pratt, for those of you who are uneducated in the movie universe or are not a big fan of dinosaurs, also starred in one of my other favourite films Jurassic World and his performance there was also very good. In other words Chris Pratt is the boom of the movie-verse. Forget Star Wars #ImWithGroot 10/10",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

The action is very good although if I had one comment it would be that during the final fight the camera shakes around a bit too much, but nothing too serious.

This movie does just about everything right. There is amazing character development in the movie's short 2 hour run. Chris Pratt is the perfect actor to be Starlord, as he is very funny when the movie needs him to be yet also able to be the hero delivering the big speech or defeating the villain when needed. Zoe Saldana plays a great Gamora, she is the complete opposite of Starlord: cunning, sly, and yet still kick-ass in her own way. Because opposites attract, these two are a perfect fit for each other, and complement each other well. Rocket is hilarious and awesome, I mean who doesn't love a furry little creature with a huge gun? Groot is one of the movies funniest characters despite saying only three words over and over: ""I am Groot."" Drax is surprisingly funny, I defiantly wasn't expecting him to deliver one of the movie's funniest performances.

","Guardians of the Galaxy is a terrific film with fantastic performances from all lead roles mainly Chris Pratt. The film is a fresh new take for the marvel cinematic universe as it delivers the excitement and wonder Marvel have failed to deliver in their movies since 2012's The Avengers. With excellent humour throughout the film, especially during a great scene between the team themselves discussing a plan on how to defeat the main villain Ronann played by Lee Pace and the ending involving Pratt's dance scene which is guaranteed to have you fall off your chair. The movie's events are linear starting from the very beginning of Peter Quill's (Pratt) story. There is also a quite noticeable great on screen chemistry between Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana, the movie is sure to satisfy both the children and adults viewing the movie. The movie's lighthearted score might be the best thing about it because the use of classical music from the 70's surprisingly works and gives you that sense of how much the movie is going to be a treat, the visual effects and tone of the movie is splendid and glorious as well as a surprisingly solid performance from newcomer and former WWE superstar Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer.

","James Gunn has created a film that I find incredibly emotive yet highly humorous, original, yet amazingly relatable, and so enjoyable that I find it beyond compare. That may be putting it on a bit thick perhaps, but I mean it. The film itself has a background only in a comic book series from several decades ago, and yet despite the apparent lack of awareness of who the Guardians of the Galaxy are (WHO????), Gunn manages to make his audience fall in love both with the characters and the Galaxy he has created; an accomplishment on its own to be admired. The main criticism I feel others have provided is that its plot- line, whilst creative, is linear and predictable, but I would respond by mentioning that the Galaxy James Gunn has had to create to allow the Guardians story to unfold in such an eloquent manner, proves that the plot of this film is anything but unoriginal, and its 'predictability' is merely a product of the skilled and intense writing. The film manages to boldly couple a new brand of unique, witty humour, with an engaging premise, plot and panoply of characters with seemingly nothing in common. Superbly edited, remarkably filmed, amazing CGI work, incredibly acting, notably by Chris Pratt, as well as the obvious Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper and others. Loved it.

It does have a bit of a ""Starwarish"" type appeal (I liked the Star Wars series), and there is some funny humour. The character's are unusual and they each have their own personality. The only thing that I would be critical of, is the tendency of writer's to insert ""2014"" slang in a movie that would not have any connection to Earth in 2014. For example, the main character uses the term ""bro"". And this is the ""spoiler"". Since he was abducted by aliens in the 1980's as a young boy, it is doubtful that he would use that term, no matter where in the galaxy he might be at the time. I know, I know...this is a small criticism, but it irks me that the writers and directors pander to the youth audience and for me it feels out of place. Beyond that, I would recommend this movie.

","Marvel's latest summer superhero blockbuster The Guardians of the Galaxy takes us away from the world of The Avengers and out into the cosmos. This movie contains action akin to the previous Marvel movies, as the fate of countless people are dependent on the success of the protagonists, in addition to a hefty amount of humor that creates a fun and exciting adventure for mostly mature audiences. The movie starts in 1988 with a young Quill (Wyatt Oleff) at his mother's death bed in a hospital. Shortly after, Quill is abducted by aliens with nothing but his clothes and a Walkman with a 1980s music mix tape. Flash forward to 2014, or present day, and the much older, now interstellar thief Peter Quill aka Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) is off exploring some distant, uninhabited planet. One traveling montage later, Quill reaches an orb that is sought after by several powerful groups of people, including a powerful warlord named Ronan (Lee Pace), for reasons unknown to Peter. After escaping Ronan's forces and attempting to sell the orb on another planet, Peter is attacked and he and three others are thrown into a maximum security prison. It is in this prison where the ""bunch of a-holes"" (Guardians) first meet. In order to escape this prison, Quill must team up with the assassin Gamora (Zoe Salanda), the psychopath Drax (Dave Bautista), the genetically engineered raccoon Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper), and the tree Groot (voice of Vin Diesel). Once they escape, they once again attempt to sell the mysterious orb, only to fail and have it stolen. Because of this, the group is forced to attempt to save the galaxy from ultimate destruction at the hands of Ronan, thus becoming The Guardians of the Galaxy. The movies belong to the geeks during the summer. Ever since Iron Man in 2008 Marvel superhero movies have been on the rise in popularity at the box office. Following with movies from The Avengers to Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Marvel has experienced huge amounts of success with comic book hero movie adaptations. Marvel's latest release continues this trend while moving the story away from Earth. The Guardians of the Galaxy are not actually heroes, and are, instead, a group of criminals who get tossed into the role of heroes. The movie quickly became one of the most popular superhero movies to ever hit the screen, and is often described as ""the most fun I've ever had at the movies in a while"" (Crawford). Unlike other superhero movies, humor is at the forefront of the entertainment value along with the action, rather than being just an added bit during the less exciting parts of the movie. The movie still contains copious amounts of action and explosions, however the humor adds goofiness to the whole experience, allowing the movie to stand out. The humor in The Guardians of the Galaxy is made effective by the situations in which it is used and how it is executed by the actors, which in turn makes the movie ridiculous and exciting causing the movie to stand out among all other previous superhero movies.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014

","When you think of an intergalactic movie, you will probably think of Star Wars because it is one of the longest running and most successful franchises in the movie industry. However, Guardians of the Galaxy directed by James Gunn, encompasses a mix of the action and adventure from Star Wars with the humor of a comedy to become an iconic household name. The Marvel movie was released on July 21, 2014. The movie stars Chris Pratt as Peter Quill, also known as Star Lord, Zoe Saldana as Gamora, Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer, Vin Diesel as the voice of Groot, Bradley Cooper as the voice of Rocket, Lee Pace as Ronan the Accuser, and Benicio del Toro as Taneleer Tivan or the Collector. The movie takes place in various places around the galaxy, both in space and on planets. James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy goes far beyond the average cosmic adventure by successfully blending intense action packed scenes with impressive graphics, hilarious comedy, and heartfelt moments. The movie was also made with an amazing mix of 70's classics and a powerful message that you can do more together than you can alone that made it one of the best blockbuster movies of the year.
 This movie adds the latest team of heroes to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the Guardians of the Galaxy. The movie begins with an opening scene taking place on earth in 1988. The character's name is Peter Quill and he is with his family because his mother is in the hospital about to die. He's outside his mother's room listening to music from his cassette tape labeled Awesome Mix Vol. 1. When his mother is about to die, she calls Quill over to her bed and wants to give him a present. But, he won't accept it so his uncle takes it and puts it in his backpack. When she dies, Quill runs out of the hospital, onto a grassy field. Then a spaceship filled with space pirates who call themselves the Ravagers come and kidnap him. In the next scene, it's 26 years later and Quill is grown up, and on a planet called Morag. He steals an orb, but is later caught and thrown in a prison called the Kyln after a fight with the assassin Gamora and bounty hunters Groot and Rocket on the planet called Xandar. While in prison, these four meet an inmate named Drax and together they find a way to escape. They try to sell the orb to the the Collector, a man who collects the rarest things of the galaxy, and he reveals it to be an infinity stone, an ancient item of great destructive power. Ronan appears and steals the orb. He uses the infinity stone inside the orb to infuse his hammer with power. With that power, Ronan planned to destroy Xandar, but Quill's crew steals the stone back and uses it to destroy Ronan and save the planet from destruction. In the aftermath, Quill gives the real stone to the Nova Corps, the police force of the Nova Empire for safe keeping. For their heroic actions, Quill's crew becomes known as the Guardians of the Galaxy. Finally, Quill opens his gift from his mother given to him all those years ago, and it's revealed to be a cassette tape of his mother's favorite songs labeled Awesome Mix Vol. 2.
 In a user review on IMDb, one reviewer wrote that the Guardians of the Galaxy was bad because there is a bad soundtrack. The songs choices made sense, they complimented what was going on in the movie perfectly. When there was a happy and playful scene, there was a song in the soundtrack that was playful and when there was a sad song the soundtrack played a more morbid song. They even made you feel more comfortable, as Gunn put it, ""the music was a way to invite you in and make you feel a little more comfortable, because it's something we're familiar with in the face of all this oddness."" He was right; the 70's classics brought a piece of Earth to the vast galaxy which helped connect the audience to the movie better. The soundtrack was also nominated for a Grammy for best compilation soundtrack for visual media, so the reviewer is not correct in saying the soundtrack was bad if it was recognized for such a prestigious award. One reviewer wrote that the movie was only non stop action and that it ""failed to trigger any deeper emotion inside me,"" but there are actually a lot of slower moments in the movie that balance out the fiery action scenes. One example is the scene where Quill's mother dies. Another example was when Groot decided to put his life in danger even when he knew he was going to die in order to save the rest of Quill's crew from the impact of Ronan's crashing ship. Before he sacrifices himself, Groot says ""We are Groot,"" his first sentence ever that wasn't ""I am Groot."" Rocket thinks Groot is dead, but luckily he finds a twig left that can be nursed into a new Groot. Rocket isn't the emotional guy in the movie, but he's starts breaking down over the death of his friend. These slower and more heartfelt scenes are needed to make a good movie, great and this movie successfully showcases a variety of emotions that made it great. Another reviewer wrote that the CGI characters and animation were poorly made, but there were very detailed characters and animation. For example, Rocket and Groot were extremely detailed. You could see the individual furs on Rocket and the indentations on Groot's body almost as if you were looking at a tree in real life. When you look at them you wouldn't be able to tell they weren't real other than the fact genetically modified raccoons and walking trees don't exist. The movie was also nominated for numerous awards for visual effects and and makeup and hairstyling, including two oscars two BAFTA awards, four Saturn awards, and winning the best makeup Saturn award which proves how well all the designs were for the movie.
 Of all the reasons Guardians of the Galaxy was so good, the biggest reason was because of the message it projected. It projected an important message of working together is better than doing everything alone and it also emitted a close sense of family. I thought their message was something everyone could use in their everyday lives and that it would help improve and relieve the stresses of life. You can see the characters show this life lesson in many of the scenes. An example of this is the prison break. None of the guardians could have broken out of the prison and as fast as they did without the help of the others, well except for Quill who was told to get a useless prosthetic leg as a joke. But, even Quill had an important part, he provided the ship they would use to escape. They all had important individual roles that made their task a lot easier. Instead of Gamora having to find an arm band to control the facility, hold off all of the guards, obtain the prison's power source, secure the watchtower, use the power source and arm band to shut off the artificial gravity, and find a ship to escape it, she only had to obtain a guard's arm band. The process of escaping was much more efficient when they all worked together. You can see the value the guardians place on family because by the end of the movie, they are all willing to die for each other. When Quill steals the stone from Ronan, he is immediately affected by the stone's power and is about to die from it. Then Gamora reaches out and grabs his hand sharing the load of the stone, then Drax and Rocket do the same knowing it might destroy all of them. But, they couldn't let Quill die so they did it anyway.
 Another reason Guardians of the Galaxy was so good was because of the hilarious comedy woven throughout the movie. The comedy provided a lightheartedness to the movie that made it very enjoyable to watch and the implementing of comedic moments was so successful, that more comedy was added to some of Marvel's future films, such as Thor: Ragnorak. One example of the movie's funny humor is when the guardians are trying to escape prison. Quill calls Drax a walking thesaurus and Drax says ""do not ever call me a thesaurus."" Then Quill says it's a metaphor, but Rocket says, ""metaphors are just gonna go over his head."" Drax responds by saying, ""nothing goes over my head, my reflexes are too fast. I would catch it."" Gamora is thinking, ""I am gonna die surrounded by the the biggest idiots in the galaxy."" It's so funny that Drax takes everything so literally and responds so bluntly to it. Another funny scene was during the credits when Baby Groot was dancing to ""I Want You Back,"" but when Drax turned to look at him, he immediately freezes and later continues once Drax looks away. A third funny scene is when Quill challenges Ronan to a dance off right at the moment he is winding up to destroy Xandar so he would be distracted as Rocket and Drax prepare to shoot a projectile at his hammer to free the stone. There are many of these hilarious scenes that helped the movie to stay light and fun. Also, most action movies don't have any comic relief, but this movie does which made it very memorable because rarely does an action movie balance both action and humor perfectly.
 In conclusion, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" was rightfully the biggest movie of the year due to its outstanding performance in expressing various emotions, beautiful graphics, a top selling soundtrack, and for presenting an inspiring message. The director was very successful in making this a must watch movie for everyone. If the sequels to this movie are anywhere as good as this one, we are looking at many more to come and if you haven't seen this movie, watch it now.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014
1597,2 December 2018,stevenb-02694,10," Awesome movie worth watching, Marvels gamble pays off in this one
","Guardians of the galaxy starring Chris Pratt as Peter Quill, A.K.A Star Lord, Vin Diesel as Groot and Bradley Cooper as Rocket Racoon was a great movie. This movie started out in the 80's when Peter Quill's mother is sick. she asks peter to take her hand, but he is too afraid and pulls it back. Moments later Peter Quill's mother passes away. Peter runs out side extremely sad, when he is abducted. Flash forward twenty-six years, Peter Quill is on the planet Morag trying to steal the 'Orb"" while listening to his Awesome mix tape no.1 his mother gave him. Immediately Peter is faced with people after him and the orb when he narrowly escapes. Peter tries to sell the orb but is unsuccessful. This is when Peter runs into Groot, Rocket Racoon and Gamora. Throughout the movie Peter is tested while trying to keep the orb out of the hands of Ronan. Not only is Peter tested but his friendship/ family bonds are tested with his new rag tag team tasked with saving the world.
The major theme of this movie is about family and this is shown many times throughout the movie. Right away you have Peter who seemed to have a happy family before it was torn away from him. He is then abducted/adopted by mentor Yondu. Peter shows that he has a very strong attachment to the mix tape of music that he had from his mother when he was abducted. Right away in the beginning of the movie you have multiple scenes that show up close shots of kids running happily with their pets and parents portraying a happy family. Shortly after the scenes of the happy kids and families Peter is united with his rag tag group that will eventually become is new family. This rag tag team made up of Star Lord, Groot, Rocket Racoon and Gamora are tested putting their friendships and trust in each other to the test.
It was interesting to note right away the film establishes the strong connection between Peter and the Walkman that plays the Awesome Mix Tape no. 1. In the middle of the movie you see this again as the mix tape is shown playing in the space ships cassette radio. Again, you see this same radio at the end of the movie when everything is in pieces the radio that was in the space ship seems intact.
Overall this was a great movie that I can see watching multiple times. There was the perfect balance between comedy and action. The comedy in the movie never reached the point where it would have made the movie feel cheesy, but instead fit in the scenes perfectly. The acting was great each character seemed to fit their roles very well making everything seem natural. The use of lighting throughout the movie was spot on always representing a contrast between good and evil. Each member of the team came from broken families, but after multiple tests this team of superheroes comes out as a strong and happy family.",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014
1598,30 November 2018,wlange-57600,9," One of the funniest movies of all time
","Guardians of the Galaxy was made in 2014 but still one of my favorite movies to this day. It's a comedy and action movie that is full of funny moments and action packed and has some of the funnies cast and lines of all of the marvel movies.
My favorite character in my opinion is star lord also known as Peter Quill. He's my favorite because he's the main character and he says the best lines especially near the end of the movie. I would rate this movie a 9/10 just because I think it should be a little longer.
In the movie thanos appears near the middle of the movie and he ties into other movies that were released recently. I really like that because the creators of the movie played attention to the little details and incorporated them into later movies. Thanos is later in the new avengers and so is the crew of Guardians of the Galaxy and it just all ties together and that's what about marvel.
Also the main song in the movie is ""hooked on a feeling"" and when I hear that song I think of Guardians of the Galaxy. One thing I wish they did was in Guardians of the Galaxy vol 2 they used that song because that's what makes me remember the movie.
There's always something happening in the movie and nothing is ever boring. When there is an action seen it looks so good and it's always intense and full of bright colors and moving objects. Also I like how they incorporate old music in to the futuristic time period. I think the first Guardians of the Galaxy was better than the second one because I think there is more funny moments in it and I like in the beginning where he flashes back to when he was a kid.
Overall I love this movie because it's just so packed with action and hilarious moments. You need to see this movie if you haven't already",/review/rw4486926/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2014
