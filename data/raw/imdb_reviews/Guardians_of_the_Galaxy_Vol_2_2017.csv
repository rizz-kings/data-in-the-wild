0,25 March 2018,Platypuschow,9," Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2: Exceeds already high expectations
",Despite being a huge comic book nerd I was not familiar with the Guardians before the first movie came out. I did some googling and upon learning about this sci-fi superhero team consisting of a talking raccoon and tree man I was hardly impressed.,/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017
1,30 November 2020,SebMoz,8," Yes. Just yes
","My god, I did not expect this movie to be this good. I am a big fan of the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie, and while I do think it is one of the better MCU movies, this one is just better in practically every way. The plot is well structured, and the pacing is great. The movie also explores its characters way more thoroughly than the previous one. The struggle of finding a place where you belong is a central theme, and every important character has their own struggles related to this. The performances are great as usual, every actor really brings their own flavor to their character. The movie also has great visuals, with all the wacky and fun ideas you might expect from a space movie. The action scenes are great, and the cgi is pretty flawless. The movie is also way funnier than any other MCU movie, with every character being a great source of humor. It's so much comedy being presented it's actually a little too much for me sometimes. Some of the characters feel like they exist only to be comic relief, even though they also have serious struggles that deserve a more serious treatment than they get. That is my only complaint though, as this is a movie with great plot, characters and visuals, as well as a fantastic climax, even though they pulled the whole ""saving the world""-plot point again. This is one of my favorite MCU movies and space movies in general, it's a great time and I highly recommend it.",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

","It has its moments where it may crack a joke at the wrong time- but Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is easily one of the best sequels i've ever seen- and without a doubt- an absolute blast. I knew from the minute I saw the trailer for the first film that Guardians of the Galaxy was going to be something special, and the same thing applies to this film. We get the iconic characters back in all their glory, as well as some new ones. The entire cast is great, there is no doubting any of the main 5's performances, as they are simply as great as before. What I do enjoy about this film is how they decided to make Nebula less of a 2D character and really provide the depth they didn't have time for her character in the first film. We also get an excellent performance from Kurt Russell as the God Ego- as well as newcomer Pom Klementieff's hilarious portrayal of Mantis, and of course the brilliant Michael Rooker as Yondu. The soundtrack is great, obviously, and Gunn's direction is so excellently crafted and visually sound that you can't help but feel every aspect of emotion he is going for while making it. It's an incredibly funny film, with some great action scenes, and a deeply emotional turmoil that honestly made me cry once...or twice. The visuals are also fantastic, as well as the makeup, and the look of the film is incredibly well developed- as well as its style and atmosphere. In the end, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is everything you would hope the sequel would be and more. It may not be quite as good as the original, but it certainly is more than a worthy successor.",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

","The movie is full of heart , well directed and has some great messages as the first one but it is funnier than its predecessor. This can be sometimes an advantage and other times a disadvantage. Not quite as fresh as the original, but it's still a great triumph with one of the most emotionally impactful endings of any Marvel Cinematic Universe story. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 might not be as amazing as the first movie but it's a fun ride with characters we love.",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

","The first film was the most unexpected. That was one of the most colourfull space films I have ever seen. Youthful, energetic, fantastic visuals and so the same followed in this sequel as well. Not the same good, but stood to the expectation of the first film's success. This story does not have a great adventure in the galaxy. A simple quest, but a thrilling action-adventure.

","This movie was a very fun superhero film. It did not provide us with very heavy storyline, the premise was quite simple and best of it all, it was having lots and lots of funny moments. My wife and I truly enjoyed this movie as we had laughs all over the movie and there were even some emotional moments as well which was very lovely to see at the end (and made my wife very emotional). I love the chemistry among the Guardians, and I loved Baby Groot's very cute and adorable behavior.

","As someone who was floored by the first film, I was eager to see how the second installment in Gunn's trilogy(yes, it's a trilogy now) would pan out. To be honest, I was a bit anxious, as we are familiar with Hollywoods track record when it comes to sequels. However there are rare moments when the sequel lives up to it's predecessor. As is the case here, as Gunn delivers the same charm, humor and emotion as the first film. The big difference is the focus on Peter's story, As our heroin meets his long lost father Ego(brilliantly played by Kurt Russell), who shows up at the knick of time, as Rocket pisses off Ayesha(Elizabeth Debicki) who sends a space armada after them. To add the cherry on top of this pie is the soundtrack(Sam Cooke's Bring it on Home to Me), that was meticulously chosen. If you were a fan of the first, don't doubt, Gunn delivers a space opera that lives up to it's hype. I have high hopes for the future of the MCU, it's clear that the studio let Gunn's creativity speak for itself and boy did he have a lot to say.",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is back and flashy as ever when it comes to its visual style of action, soundtrack, a fun cast, and the laughable humor. Usually sequels can be a let down after its predecessor set the standards high. And the build up momentum for the sequels is easily forgotten. Writer/Director James Gunn manages to continue what worked on the first movie and expand further with the characters he brought together. Yes, it is a ragtag of misfits that try to be a team and argue to each other with their own personal issues. In the end, they see each other not as friends but family.

","3 hour movies are usually too long. (Some movies are too long at any length). This movie seemed too short. The whole film is fun to watch. Most of the pacing, the story and the dialogue are excellent. The humor is actually funny and the characters, which were introduced in the first GG film, continue to be dynamic in this sequel. I actually cared about the characters. I especially liked Michael Rooker's An-du character, and his admission that he loves Quill like a son. Actually, the only ones who don't get a happy ending are the Cree & Ego. Great special effects too. 👍🏻👍🏻",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

","I just now remember clearly about part 1,after I saw part two.It was part of the grand opening of the mini -max in 2014.For some reason I never payed attention to Chris Prat at that time.In the same theater,now with a bright picture,thing have changed.Now there's Baby Groot,since Daddy Groot had died in the first one.Gamora and her evil sister Nebula,now being taken to prison for a crime, Daddy is gone.Now Gamora,Drax,Rocket Peter are now super friend fighting all the crime in the universe,but, they have a lot of conflict with each other,almost like where that nebula and Gamora have sibling rivalry with each other.In the cave scene where Nebula was chasing Gamora with her space ship where ,it ends up in crash,after Gamora rescues nebula,Gamara admits that she had felt that she had to win all the time is that their sisterly relationship was sour.Peter,played by the king of 3D ,look how many films Rhonda Fleming did in 3D,discover that he has allegedly a father,played by Kurt Russel,as Ego.So the supper heroes are invited to Ego's planet ,but something is too good to be true about it.Gamora tries to warns Peter,but, he is too enthrall about hew found Daddy.there seems to be a strong daddy theme here.There is the new character,who is assistant of Ego a female character with dark eyes and two pointing sensor on her heard ,Mantis played by Pom Klementieff ,who senses feelings from everyone.Drax ,played by Dave Bautista is so obsessed with his wife and child being gone still that he does not like Mantis.When I saw the beginning of the sequence when Pete's father,who was young looking Kurt Russel.You thought how did they make him look younger?Was it through digital process ? nope.It was another actor, Aaron Swartz.Sylvester Stallone makes an appearance in which he is the leader of a group,that kicked out Yondo,played by Michael Rooker, for making profit.Yondu was the one who kidnapped Peter end enslaved him ,there is a big surprise about Yondu at the end.When Ayesha,played by Elisabeth Debicki,with her assistant ,played by Meredith Quill,declares war against the super friends.Her team fight them in a way that it looks like all of them are playing a video arcade game.One of the bad character has a strong ego about his name ,Taser Face ,played by Chris Sullivan,As the character explains ,""would know fear ,hearing my name ,"" or what what he was emphasizing in so many words,leads to a laugh.Stan Lee makes an appearance.Single strip 3D as usual.Equivalent OT Eastman color versus technicolor.Very entertaining.05/21/17",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

",I guess after the incredible successful of the first movie Marvel finally gave James Gunn all the right to create his own superheroes movie and the result is Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 not only a fun movie sequel but also a big pop culture Easter eggs.The movie is fill with enough iconic figures of the late 80s and 90s that guarantee to make you have a nostalgic blast from start to finish.The humor of the movie is still there with many scene that make the audience laugh out loud involving The Guardians especially Rocket and baby Groot but sometime does get a little over head.The chemistry between characters is as strong as ever when this time they not only have to save the galaxy one again but also have to face off with their own problem and learn how to work not as a team but as a family.Because family is the main topic of this movie so you have to expect there a lot of cheesy speech about family that kinda awkward and ridiculous at first but in the end it managed to make me almost cried.One last thing you guys seriously need to check out Awesome mix vol 2 it freaking kick ass,/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

","If repetitive chase sequences, contrived colorful explosions at the end of every action sequence, and occasionally forced and isolated comedy are the only parameters that you judge a superhero movie in 2017 with, then Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 should be a collector's product. There's a lot of references in this film that demands you go back to Vol. 1 and also take a 50-hour pop culture lesson narrated by Stan Lee. The plot associated with Walkman-ambassador leader guardian Quill's parentage is a boring cliché and one that makes you puke, considering there are more grotesque beings and objects in the film. A sheer lack of novelty, the inability to improve the charm in the characters, and reckless usage of CGI majorly affects James Gunn's second major feature film that is gaudier than the film's obnoxious poster. Chris Pratt has begun to slightly annoy and if he maintains a similar air we'll have to turn to DC by the time these guardians create the next volume. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is an ordinary superhero film with lots of blabbering using advanced vocabulary and lots of flashes, lasers, flares, and plasma. It also has a gold-obsessed priestess awkwardly trying to get at the guardians for stealing a bunch of her Duracell batteries. Like this, there are many more mindless arcs, but I'm fairly content because Quill was finally introduced to Microsoft Zune, arguably one of the best music players to come out of the technology race.

I can't believe these bunch of lovable misfit a-holes made one of the most MATURE themed films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film is visually gorgeous. The use of colour, design and the straight up imagination of the source material outstand any MCU film prior. The action is glorious and astonishing. One scene in particular, I was jaw-dropped in its entirety as direction, action-choreography and music all came together so harmoniously. And THE MUSIC! What an eargasmic soundtrack. The songs are more poetic this time around and fit the subtext of the film perfectly. The trailers gave me the feel of the first movie; a straight-up Sci-fi action-comedy with a simple point A to B plot. GotGV2 is so much MORE than this! This film is patient with its characters and there is an emphasis on growth and family. It manages to balance 7-8 characters and gives almost all of them a satisfactory emotional arc. There is so much to chew on here with the issues and motifs felt by certain characters and I applaud that! This film is vastly different and I'm glad because I just love these characters so much! They are still so fun and energetic. It's great to see the team again and how their dynamic transforms. Also I forget to mention, the film is laugh-out-loud funny!

It was boring, and after the first hour or so, I was eagerly waiting for the movie to end. While in the first film the old school music was a clever tool to create a unique atmosphere, in this one it quickly became tired, as the movie was too heavily relying on it. Also, they used waaaaay too much exposition. Almost everything you learn about the characters, their backstories and the plot itself, they tell you through dialogue. (That's poor writing.) One more thing that really bothered me (among many other things) was Sean Gunn.

","When Guardians of The Galaxy first hit the cinema multiplexes in the summer of 2014, it was a surprising success, especially for a superhero film based on comic books that very few knew about. Grossing around a quarter from crossing the billion-dollar mark, it was fairly predictable for a sequel to see the light of the day. This second installment, which helms director and writer James Gunn as the conductor, brings back our favorite heroes from the first film and places them in an all-new adventure. While this film made the score as a wild crowd-pleaser with its clever humor and tense, special-effects-laden galore, this one perhaps marks a just a slight stepback from its predecessor. Cutting back by a fraction on its zany, light-hearted tone in favor of deep character development and heart, this film delivers the fun and excitement with only a few flaws that go marginally noticeable. This film focuses on the Guardians: Peter Quill/Star Lord (played by Chris Pratt), Gamora (played by Zoe Saldana), Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), Drax (played by Dave Batista), and the now Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). The team travels to a distant planet where they come across a celestial named Ego (played by Kurt Russell) who happens to be Peter's long-lost father.

","I think that when you have such a phenomenon like Guardians of The Galaxy it is really hard to duplicate its awesomeness, it's almost like catching lightning in a bottle, and the attempt to do it again without exploding. And that's why with a few exceptions most movie sequels tend to suck. Now, this movie didn't suck, in fact it was pretty good!",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017
130,28 August 2017,Ziya90,1," Escapist entertainment at its worst
","Guardians of the Galaxy 2 is like The Avengers: Age of Ultron. After a spectacular, wonderful first film, it becomes a formulaic mess! Again, the movie opens by a scene which our heroes are threw into a mission for no reason and they are in danger, so they fight against an unknown enemy without building an introduction or tension. Just pure audiovisual joy. That's the key word to describe this movie: pure joy, but nothing else. We had high expectations and expected the movie to be greater than the first, but instead it was a total mess. The star of this movie is baby Groot but he is too cute. The mature Groot in the first movie was naturally funny and intimidating at the same time, here everybody tries to be amusing. The sentimentality in some scenes feel superficial. I just didn't buy it. Kurt Russell and Sylvester Stallone are cast in the same movie together years after Tango and Cash for the first time which is a historic moment, but they never come across during the movie. What??? The villain of the movie makes no sense and there is a relationship between the villain's motivation and Peter Quill's past, but why do you dig for the stories which were perfectly built in the first movie? What is wrong with you? We were exposed to the same forced sentimentality and story being tied to another story in the latest sequel of The Pirates of the Caribbean. Maybe, the most annoying relationship in the movie is between two sisters. It was ridiculous. I almost couldn't endure watching this character and her relationship with her sister, because it looks fake. It is just a plot device. The movie recalls the movie Zardoz which is nice, little Greek tragedy and definitely the best part of the movie is trying to escape from space prison part, but oh man, this was a total mess! Even the post credit scenes were boring and uninteresting. In the second half, we watch action, action and more action until we become mentally tired! The team has ""we are a family"" message for you like Fast and Furious movies and as said before, the movie is very similar with its poster: a complete audiovisual mess! Lots of CGI, lots of noisy action and overblown visuals with no properly built up story, no development, no tension and no heart and soul. By the way, like most of the movies in these days, the villain explains everything one by one, evil plans are included, to make everything clear for us at some point! Jokes are mostly unfunny and forced, Gamora has a lesser screen time, it is a pity, Drax doesn't fight much this time and everything else is a mess except for great Stallone! This is a must see for ""GOTG"" fans to follow the story, but keep your expectations low. However, your kids may love it!",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

","The best thing about Marvel is also the worst thing: They always try to outdo themselves with the next film in the MCU. Sometimes it really works like with this film, and Captain America 2 and 3, and sometimes it doesn't like with Iron Man 2 and Thor 2. But the advantage is they know how to keep making it better. They take fan's criticisms and complaints into account and try really hard to fix them. Such is the case with this film. Not that I had anything to complain about with part 1, but man, this definetely beats part 1 by a lot. Everything about this is better. The pacing, the story, the dialouge, the humor, and even the soundtrack. It manages to keep the style, spirit, and tone of everything we loved about the first film while also breaking new ground with it. It's very hard to make lightning strike twice, especially with a film with as weird a premise as Guardians of the Galaxy. By all accounts, the first film shouldn't have worked. Even more so the case with this film. Marvel has managed to do the impossible twice now. This is good, because it proves they're willing to take risks, but this is also bad, because now they'll be forced to outdo themselves every time, until eventually they'll be crushed by their own unattainable expectations. I'm very worried this will happen in the near future, especially as new films come out with new characters and new crossover films. Will we eventually be too greedy and want more and more and bigger and better each time until we're disappointed? I hope not. I know this isn't really a review of the movie, so much as it is about Marvel, but it's getting really had to keep this spoiler-free. Trust me, this is one film where you want to go in knowing as little as possible. Don't read the comics, don't use social media until you've seen the film. And I cannot stress this enough: Do not leave until ALL the credits have finished!!!!.
There is a total of 5 (Yes, FIVE) end credits scenes. And all are important especially as we gear up for Infinity War.

Ironically, 3 years later Guardians is about the only MCU series I even bother keeping up with any more(not that I don't like the others, I just kind of got burnt out after 15+ films all trying to tie in). I was nervous, because what made the first film so memorable to me was how much it's quality and humor surprised me, something which I was sure Vol. 2 would try and fail to recreate, as many sequels to surprise smash hits tend to do. However, director James Gunn has surprised me once again, taking the Guardians into new territory in a film filled with top notch action, impressive visuals, and gut splitting humor in a storyline that is refreshingly original.",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

The scene where Kurt Russel explains his origins to StarLord seems directly taken from the MAN Of Steel, but seems very stupid. The Space creatures are Gross.

","When going to watch Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 the main thing I was looking for was to have fun, and on that account this film sure does deliver. The characters we know and love are still just as great and a couple of new people are introduced too. However, Gamora is still the most boring character out of the Guardians, and unfortunately, Drax doesn't really do a lot except tell jokes, which are very funny admittedly. Baby Groot makes up for this and is great, if not just a little worse than the last incarnation of him we saw in the last movie. Once again the villain is not great, but he is better than Ronan in the last movie. The real flaw with this movie is that it simply isn't as good as the first one. Number 1 captured lightning in a bottle and this one attempts that and comes pretty close, but in the end, doesn't. This does not make it a bad film, however. It is still hilarious, action packed and a great deal of fun improving on some elements of the original and I recommend it to any fans of Guardians of the Galaxy.

161,8 May 2017,ironhorse_iv,8," This Intergalactic Superhero Movie was Marvelous. What a blast!
","'Guardians of the Galaxy' was once known, as one of the least recognized Marvel comic books of all time, even with 2008 reboot by writers Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning. However, that all change in 2014, when director James Gunn create a cosmic masterpiece of a film, loosely based on this offbeat source. Nobody saw it, coming. It was like, 'Star Wars' for a new generation. A peculiar small popcorn flick that somehow became a successful, because how fun, it was to watch. It really did eclipses everything around it, at the time, even strong Marvel movies like 'the Avengers"" series. It was a blockbuster hit that was mostly universally loved. So, it was no surprised to anybody, that a sequel was quickly greenlight, and put out in production. You don't need to see space to know, a shining star. Just like the original movie, 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.' shines just as bright. It's equally as fun, as the first movie. Yet, unlike the first movie, this film does suffer from some long pacing issues. I found the movie to be, a bit slow at times. Mostly, toward the beginning of the film, where the story had to brand off, into multiply subplots for each character of the Guardians team. Don't get me wrong, I did like, seeing them, having something to do, while, Star-Lord AKA Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) learn more about his true parentage from Ego, the living planet (Kurt Russell) as we learn, more about them. However, I just felt, that the film could had speed it, up a bit. After all, did we really need long-drawn out scenes with Gamora (Zoe Saldana) dealing with family problems with Nebula (Karen Gillen) or Rocket (Voiced by Bradley Cooper) teaming up with Yondu (Michael Rooker) to take on, below-average, traitor, Taserface (Chris Sullivan). Couldn't these two problems, be solved, a lot quicker, than the 136 runtime. I get that, family is a big theme in this movie and serves as its unifying plot thread, but all these individual character arches needed to be better balanced. It doesn't help that the movie kinda waste time on jokes that somewhat fall flat for me. A good example is, most of the scenes with Baby Groot (Voiced by Vin Diesel). Yes, he's adorable, but do we really need to see him, dance around in a fight scene for so long. I didn't find it, as funny as I should had. If anything, it just slow the movie, down for me. Honestly, if there was one character that really makes this film, enjoyable to watch. It has to be Drax (Dave Bautista). Most of the jokes with him hit my funny bone, because how quick, they landed. It wasn't drawn out like the ones with Groot or Rocket. It was rapid and on the point. While, the movie is not as funny as the original, at least, the antagonist in this movie is a huge improvement from the last one. Without spoiling too much, he wasn't as one-note evil, as the others Marvel villains. He does seem, a little better-rounded; than the others, however, it does feel, a bit odd, that he would reveal Peter Quill's mother death, seeing how he's secretly trying to work with him. That was a bit, out of the blue. The same, can be said with Yondu suddenly becoming more of a father-figure to Peter, than the first movie. That was weird that he was willing to help Peter, seeing how he was trying to kill him in the previous movie. Still, I did like how the film, had more stakes in its climatic action, than the last film. Seeing important Marvel characters die in the battle really does add to the intensity & emotional impact of the action scenes. I love how Gunn isn't afraid to have this adventure cost the lives of some of his characters. That being said, it does kinda ruins the oncoming 'Infinity War' movies, seeing how a small group of people can kill a God. How can a normal villain like Thanos (Josh Brolin), do any better? Another thing, the battle was still a bit too massive and incomprehensible for a realistic action set-piece. Parts of it, was a bit over the top like the leap through space and time. However, the visuals were still impressive. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is as beautiful to look at as the first movie, with its bright, almost 1970s's style psychedelic aesthetic. Yet, the movie doesn't have the same amount of awesome with its soundtrack as the predecessor. Don't get me wrong, the movie does have some good songs, but it was just not as impactful. Some of the tunes, really didn't fit with the scenes, its sync with. The same can be said with its cameos. I really have no clue, why the movie would introduce the original members of the comic's 1969's incarnation of the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' by Arnold Drake and Gene Colan without establishing their history, first. It's a hard sell for a spin-off film. Nevertheless, I dig the Stan Lee cameo, toward the end. That was nice. Also, if anybody was looking forward to any ""Avengers: Infinity War' teaser in the end credit. They would quickly be disappointed. None of the mid- and post-credit scenes doesn't shows that. Overall: With all that say, 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' doesn't really need to tie with any of the other MCU films. It pretty much works as its standalone sequel with everybody, old & new playing their part, well, even if some actors voices is a little bit jarring, like Michael Rooker. For the most part, it delivers on the things you love about the first movie, and improve on it.

","First things first, I'm neither a dc fan, nor marvel's. But i gotta say, this movie does not deserve an eight star rating. I mean yes the jokes were kinda funny, yes the cgi was kinda good, yes the makeup has some high details (although you can see the makeup in gamora's eye pretty much faded in the film.) But other than that, the movie is awful;. The plot was horrible. I mean why does Ego revealed that he killed Peter's mom??? It's not like that he is stupid enough to do that. If you have lived for thousands of years, you shouldn't be that dumb. Also, why do Ego takes form of the human in the first place??? And why does he mate with other species with that human form??? (You can see it in the statues in Ego's castle). Another bad thing from this movie is the actor's expressions. Whenever they are sad, or mad or something like that, i don't see it in their faces. For example, when ego stupidly tells peter that he killed her mother, you can see peter screaming, but the expression, the scream, its just don't feel realistic. I almost thought that he was an amateur stuntman or something like that. Another thing, some people considers this movie is the most mature film MCU made (some review said that) but it's not. Only because you have some sexual jokes doesn't mean that it's mature. It's just darkly funny for adults that can understand it, kids wouldn't understand it.

Sadly, this film can't hold a candle to the first, and indeed it suffers from all of the usual sequel problems that have plagued Hollywood down the decades. It tries to be bigger and badder but instead feels bloated and unnecessary, with a plot that involves the main characters sitting around aimlessly for a while and the only interest coming from supporting players in their own mini-adventures. The film has a dumber, more lowbrow feel than before, with jokes about body parts and functions that feel rather crass.

","After reading through the sea of effusively positive reviews, I feel compelled to add to the short list of those who actually seemed to have watched the movie. This movie was a complete and utter disaster. I actually rank the first GOTG as my favorite of the Marvel franchise (and easily the most watched at around 20 times), so I was very excited to see this one. I can honestly say I've never before been disappointed by a Marvel production (modern era), and I have actually thought aloud on more than one occasion that Marvel just seems to know how to get it right. It seemed they were infallible, incapable of putting out a bad movie. Unfortunately, they finally got it wrong. The best word I've seen used is forced. Everything feels forced. The plot, the acting, the action, the jokes, the emotion....all of it. With all other Marvel movies, you immerse into the story, you live the plot. While watching this, I gradually become less and less immersed and became increasingly aware of how awful the movie was. I finished it, hoping for a rebound, but it just gets worse, like a turd rolling down hill. By the end, its like a Gatlin gun of turd pellets being shot from the screen, a run of bad jokes, bad acting, bad dialogue, bad plot, and just plain bad experience. I'm truly just dumbfounded that Marvel could screw up at all, and especially this badly. How is this even the same director as the first? Did he have a stroke since the first film? I feel like I've gone through all of the stages of grief except acceptance, and I never will accept this Kentucky Klondike Bar of a movie. Go home GOTG2, you're drunk.

This addresses some of the darkest elements a human or in this case an alien like creature can go through. There is domestic abuse, bullying, self-esteem issues, abandonment, disappointment, regret, anger, murder, and countless other major things addressed. However, this movie still manages to be one of the funniest movies I have literally ever seen with a PG-13 rating and that isn't directly called a comedy. In my opinion, the first volume was funny but they balanced it with enough serious acting and themes to make it an action movie more than a comedy. In this one, they have built on the teams' chemistry and have managed to mix this a lot better and make the movie address huge issues and still make you walk out in a happy mood.

","It's almost impossible for a sequel to out-preform it's predecessor, although it has been accomplished more than once in recent years (The Winter Soldier, The Dark Knight, etc.). The first Guardians of the Galaxy was, and still is, one of my favorite movies of 2014. Knowing this, I went into GOTG2 with lowered expectations, yet eager to see what fun eye candy the director, James Gunn, had in store this second time around. Needless to say I came out pleased and satisfied with what I had gotten. Is it as good as the first? No. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 does not quite capture the magic of the first film, but it delivers the same laughs and action that we know and love. The very opening scene with Baby Groot dancing to ELO's ""Mr. Blue Sky"" while a huge inter- dimensional space monster battle rages behind him delivers the tone of the movie perfectly: it's fun. The main reason so many fell in love with the first Guardians was how fun and joyful it all was. This sequel certainly captures that same feel, while delivering more on the humor as well. You notice an attempted effort to include lots more jokes and laughter into this second movie, and while some jokes don't hit as they intended, most do. So why isn't Guardians of the Galaxy 2 as good as the first? The plot. The first 30 to 45 minutes are spent without a real purpose, and it isn't until around halfway through the movie when an actual goal comes to fruition. Star Lord, played magnificently once again by Chris Pratt, finds his long lost father, Ego. While this seems compelling, many scenes in the beginning parts of the movie don't flow very well. Contrast this to the first film where every scene flawlessly fit into place one cut after another. Some scenes between the first and second act feel a little disjointed and choppy, but the movie soon picks up for a spectacular third act. Overall, this movie is a fun escape (with an excellent soundtrack) that will please most, despite not quite capturing the extraordinary feel of the original.",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

","Let me start by saying that I am no die-hard fan of either Marvel or DC Comics. Maybe that is also due to the fact that there's been an overkill of superhero flicks these last couple of years, but even then, most movie viewers have already chosen a side. I personally never knew if I preferred the light-headed and fun Marvel superhero movies or if I would rather go for the darker, grittier and more realistic DC movies. Then again, I have always done my best to like a DC movie, trying to convince myself that it was a good movie even when it was actually a disappointment (maybe because of my immense love for Nolan's The Dark Knight trilogy, but ever since the quality has drastically dropped). And although I never speak too highly of the Marvel superheroes either, I almost always enjoy myself, each and every time. But oh boy, did I love Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2!

There is a great sense of being in the moment and each time we thought the magic would fade, it strengthens just a little. This is by no means the only story Mister Gunn wanted to say, because we can tell from it his great passion for the arts, but it was one that was still pretty awesome. The cast retained their great chemistry and flaws and that is pretty neat, given we are normally washed down with generic characters with blandness of a overbearing sense of perfection. There is none of that here, and the sense of vulnerability was good. The plethora of legit human emotions make me confident in vol.3 and the music was still good, so lets believe in the next ride because it will probably be the same given the dreaded sequel was not blowing up in the flames of first film's own initial success.

251,30 April 2017,Troy_Campbell,8," A rollicking good time.
","Despite existing in the ludicrously popular Marvel Universe, the first GotG outing—full of relatively unknown characters—had minimal expectations attached to it. The follow-up, however, has big shoes to fill thanks to the immense popularity of the original. Whilst it falls slightly short of blowing minds like its predecessor, Vol. 2 is still a rollicking good time that boasts inventive action sequences, edgy humour and a titular ragtag group that are so likable you don't want to leave their company. Director James Gunn brings his idiosyncratic flair to the blockbuster realm once again, imbuing the set pieces with little flourishes that add an extra depth of awesomeness to the proceedings. A booby-trap battle in the jungle is creative and hilarious, the ballsy opening credits sequence is an absolute hoot, and a Yondu-centric annihilation aboard a spaceship is undoubtedly the standout set piece of the entire film. In fact, Yondu's stock increases dramatically: his screen time triples, his arc is integral to the plot, and he's handed the most badass moment of the movie. Michael Rooker is clearly having a blast playing the arrow-wielding anti-hero. Chris Pratt leads the way though, his easy charisma shining through as Star Lord. He also shares a wonderful chemistry with Zoe Saldana—as the tough as nails Gamora—with their unspoken relationship building slowly throughout. Baby Groot is sure to be a hit with the younger audience members, but they return to that childish humour too often and the Groot-based jokes quickly become cutesy instead of cute. The biggest flaw is the finale; it's not quite blue-beam-from-the-sky bad, however it still suffers from the overwrought, CGI-hodgepodge requirement demanded of big budgeted affairs. All in all GotG Vol. 2 pushes past its flaws through sheer excitement, energy and passion, topped with another ripping soundtrack and multiple laugh-out-loud moments.",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

The comedy is actually well timed as well, it isn't thrown in at random points that disrupt the flow of the movie. The plot is also decent, it's not the best part of the film but definitely respectable. The section with the golden people(can't remember their names), while being a big part of the plot that is quite necessary, gets a bit repetitive with them constantly chasing the guardians. Much like the first movie I think the best part of this movie is the character. Undoubtedly what makes these movies so good is how well each character interacts with one another. Not only that but most of them have genuine development that has meaning that leaves the ending to be quite impactful. The movie excellently balances every character while leaving more room for them to grow and plenty of directions for future films. The villain is a bit mediocre, still works well and the acting by Kurt Russell really makes you hat the character...which is perfect.

The vibrancy of the colours makes this one of the most visually pleasing movies to watch.

","*******SPOILERS***** Now I don't know about you but every now and then I like to go and have a pizza. I don't actually care for fancy la-di-dah pizza's I just want a Dominoes thick crust with everything on it and a cold beer. Hopefully I can put my feet up and watch a good movie at the same time and once we've finished the pizza who knows we might even have some ice cream! Crazy right? It's madness! We're bonkers here. That is exactly what Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 is, Dominoes Pizza, cold beer and maybe ice cream. IMHO it's not quite as ice creamy as Vol 1, but it was thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish. I was never bored there were some genuine laugh out loud moment and it's all rather silly, but in a good way, like Star Trek can be silly but IN A GOOD WAY. If at any point I had stopped to think about the logic of the story or even went, ""hang on - wait a minute...?"", the illusion would have been ruined and I would have found a shard of glass in my thick crust. It doesn't stand up to story scrutiny but it isn't 'that sort' of film. All the visuals are totally awesome and the space ship designs and tech are (pun intended) out of this world. I'm not sure why Sci-Fi always feels the need to get Godly and have gods in them (Star Trek, 2001, Promethius (shudder) and so on and so forth and what have you) but they do, and I know that they are guardians of the galaxy and they have to protect the galaxy but can you really kill an all- knowing immortal god by punching him in the head? Apparently so! It also makes Quin guilty of patricide, he kills his father because he killed his mother, but does that make it right? I suppose so, But wait hang-on! Doh! see - I'm not supposed to think about this stuff! Quick gimme some beer! Phew! Thanks! Some really awesome casting - Stallone is ace, Kurt Russel is fabulous and I was genuinely moved at the death of blue bloke, but mostly cause he's the best actor in the film, bit of a shame his 2nd in command wasn't Alieny-at all and just looked like a skinny human, but small potatoes.

","The newest contribution to the famous MCU, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 attempts to recreate the witty, touching and clever film that came out in 2014. It also tries to stand on its own without relying on cameos from the Avengers or other superheroes, which I appreciate. However, although it tries, it doesn't quite succeed, with many jokes that fall VERY flat, plot points and twists that are strange at best and completely out of nowhere at worst and character development that leads nowhere. That is my biggest problem with the film, that it spends so much time on trying to develop characters like Yondu or Rocket and yet do it so poorly that it ends up being a waste of time. We have already established their characters in the first film, but rather than expand on it the writer chooses instead to focus on the aspects we already knew and occasionally throw in a trait that makes no sense. Drax's personality almost completely changes, we get some awkward romantic banter and the rest of the film is throwing one-liners at the audience hoping that one of them is funny. Don't get me wrong. There are good things, like the effects, acting, action, and some jokes do hit home. Also, you can tell they really tried.

305,25 April 2017,nigel-431-811649,9," Superbly Crafted sequel that fails not to disappoint!
","GOTG2. Just simply does what it was hoped and expected to do. It has built on a wonderful, tongue in cheek and yet surprisingly refreshing original. The original I approached with skepticism, a raccoon, a tree, a blue woman, a pale hulk and a rising ""chisel jawed"" A-lister, amalgamating to save the universe. I own that mistake, for as we all know now it was one of the most refreshing films in the Marvel cinematic experience. This skepticism for the original was almost echoed by knowing the apparently insurmountable objective of expanding the original concept without it parodying itself into oblivion. Once again I was surprised, if not elated at the achievement of the direction, story, the cast and visuals. It is as hammed up as a Christmas pantomime, yet the humour, blatantly obvious at times treats you to almost audience participation. It feels as if you are turning the page of your favourite comic, hoping that you know the next panel in the storyboard and being relieved, at the satisfaction of the well-conceived twist and turn or equally satisfied by the predicted character nuance based response. These are family, you are a guardian of the galaxy recruit. The tongue firmly planted in the proverbial cheek for most assaults on the emotions, it manages to largely avoid groans of soft story writing and delivery by well timed obtuse interjections. Just when you are about to groan at some saccharine infused moment you find are laughing out loud as someone blows the sentimentality out of the water. Prepare to laugh, and laugh a lot which serves to put you off guard for the inevitable emotional polarity shifts, when the rewards for great character development gives rise to losses and strains. You probably can guess the story, you probably will be three comic pages away from knowing the story, but it is with satisfaction these unveil themselves in the crafted art, complimented but not obscured by stunning visuals, amazing special effects and fantastically incorporated soundtrack. Let's face it! It is a must see for those that immerse themselves in the Marvel universe it will satisfy all your hopes for it. For the easter egg hunters. Happy bountiful Easter! For the not so familiar with the comic genre experience on screen. BUY GOTG1, watch it and enjoy and see this before it leaves the big screen.

However the film does feel chunky at times but the universe building, action, comedy and visuals more than makeup for the uneven flow. Overall, you'll be happy with this. I scored passes for an advance viewing on Wonder Woman and I'm this close to tossing them in the trash. As a true DC fan, it is heartbreaking to see Marvel kicking our backside.

","Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 2, directed, once again, by James Gunn, wasn't quite the breath of fresh air the first installment was, but it still packed a nice punch! James Gunn brings back his unorthodox style to this film, not paying off as well as the first, but still stands out as one of the better films of the MCU. I enjoyed Gunn's approach, by making this a grounded, character driven sequel, while also keeping the first addition in continuity, but by doing that, he created one too many subplots, leaving some things a little underdeveloped and choppy. Gunn utilized the same tones as the first film, while also recharging that emotional tone, but he seemed to try to throw in an extra dose of humor, and it threw the tones off in most occasions. One issue this film had that the first film didn't, was it's pace. For almost the entire first act, it was tough to see where things were going; it just felt like another Guardians film. When the second act hits, that's when it slows down, but we get great layers to all of our main characters. When the final act hits, that's where it starts to feel like a Marvel film, having big action sequences, and great chemistry between the characters.",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

","5/10 – or 8/10 if you like the first one, or big superhero movies in general I stopped watching mainstream superhero movies in 2013 and have mostly avoided them ever since. They offer nothing to me personally and I'm honestly surprised at their huge commercial and critical success, given that almost all of them are just more of the same, copying the genre trailblazers such as original X-Men"" and Iron Man"". I don't have the time nor energy to still watch the same thing over and over again after 15 years or so. How many times can you enjoy watching two guys hurl through air, repeatedly punching each other, for example? There are some exceptions to this of course (Logan"") but superheroes nowadays are better off in TV or streaming series such as Luke Cage"" where the makers get the chance to put freshness and depth on the table. The first Guardians of the Galaxy"" collected over 770 million dollars from the cinemas in 2014, so the sequel is, of course, very similar. A true-blood superhero movie, just like the grandmother used to make. It's loud, brash, full of colors and explosions and always ready to gently tease about superhero and sci-fi movies' tired clichés, without bringing anything to replace them. Yes, the result is full of energy"" and much fun"", but if you don't particularly care about the paper-thin characters or picturebook world they inhabit, it's difficult to hold interest after 30 minutes or so. And how can one care if there's never even a slight feeling that any big character is really in danger, no matter how large the explosions and enemy guns! It's all sound and fury, signifying nothing, as the late great Shakespeare would say. The story is trivial as expected and thus would work better in small doses but the movie format is much more profitable, so we get about 140 minutes in a row. Nevermind that there's maybe 90 minutes worth of story here, every self-respecting Hollywood epic must last over two hours.

","Urgh, such genuine nasty dislike for such a harmless cool kickass little Outerspace thrill ride.. Well screw you, because I f*ckin' genuinely loved it! I for one found it to be about as good as the first movie, maybe not as As novel and fresh naturally, but certainly an awesome and satisfying movie experience in its own right and a well done return to this particular universe and these characters. I greatly appreciated its more touching moments and the way that it wrapped up the story on a surprisingly sombre note. It took a wee bit to really get going but once it got to the part of the story that was at the beautiful ornate palace on the weird planet that turned out to be Peter Quil's father I was hooked and having a blast with it. It definitely wasn't lacking in the funny department, I kept laughing out loud, a lot of those quips really just kept landing for me. There were just a few times though where the ceaseless comedic bantering was beginning to hurt the pacing a little and took away from the gravity of the dramatic moments and thrilling scenes a bit..but still among other things I'd call it a hilarious movie, it's just a little Drax heavy! If you ask me it was mainly the talking tree and the raccoon that really made everyone love the original movie, but in this one those two definitely seemed a little downplayed in comparison, with the focus being mostly on Peter and the seemingly benevolent father that had found him at last... Something I loved was how effectively it fleshed out characters that you might not have expected like Yondu and definitely Nebula, she felt way more like a real character this time than the practically bit part she was before. And also Gamora had some growth through Nebula as the two gradually settled their differences through fighting and fiery explosions and general peril and realised who their true enemy was, and I really found it a touching little moment when Gamora finally embraced Nebula as a sister and she slowly holds her back for a second before storming off to wage crazy blue cyberbabe war against Thanos alone! I loved every single back and forth between the blunt and thoughtless as hell Drax, and the sweet delicate Mantis, the ditsy alien girl with empathetic powers. David Bautista and Pom Klementieff's polar opposite characters played off each other perfectly and their funny and cute interactions were a real highlight for me. When Kurt Russell as ""Ego"" first appeared I was a bit miffed and taken aback, as I was well aware of what Ego is in the comics and this was just a man, and frankly I demanded to see a damn living planet with a face! But it was very cool how they approached the more immense and awesome stuff and gradually built up to that as Mr casual easygoing Ego started to become a little scary as his coldhearted reasons for locating Peter were revealed and he casually let go that he made Peter's mother terminally ill on purpose for his own selfish needs. After that little revelation Ego became nothing but another all-powerful roaring menace to be overcome, and any possibility of anything meaningful between him and Peter was pretty much tossed right out the window, but thankfully the father and son element of the story was addressed another way. It sure was cool though to see Star Lord briefly wield the cosmic power of a..Star Lord!! It was so well written and played out the way that what at first appeared to be the ideal father that Peter thought he'd finally got turned out to be his worst nightmare and the gruff rogue who gave him a harsh upbringing and taught him what he needed to know to survive was the closest thing to a father he'd ever had and he only ever realised it right at the end as Yondu heroically sacrificed himself by giving his oxygen suit. And what an odd unlikely image to end a superhero movie on with Rocket shedding a tear, very far removed indeed from the typical triumphant sunset fist-pump type note that usually ties up these kinds of pictures. It certainly worked though and was very fitting. I felt this was a very good sequel all around and was totally more of the same goodness if you got a kick out of the original's style and wit, it was great to see more of this colourful far out world and it felt the same, only a little bigger in scope and it branched out in interesting directions and expanded its characters and even introduced a few new ones. I was amazed thrilled and definitely entertained by it, it made me laugh a lot , and I just had a fun time watching it, it's one if the best comic book flicks that I've personally seen yet, and I had no hesitation in giving it a well-deserved 8 superpower-generated giant flying rock Pacmans out of 10!

","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is up there with sequels such as Captain America: The Winter Soldier. It's full of more action, thrills, emotions, and romance while also having a great story for this follow up. After defeating Ronan and saving the galaxy, the Guardians are moving from planet to planet, while being what they called themselves galaxy savers for hire. After one of their jobs go awry in return for Nebula and they're all saved by a mysterious man played by Kurt Russell named Ego, it's revealed that he is Peter Quill/Star Lord's father. When Ego invites Peter, Gamora, and Drax to his planet while Nebula, Rocket, and Baby Groot stay behind to fix the ship, the Guardians are forced to split up in order to get back on track and find out what Ego wants from Peter, while the ravagers led by Yondu is hired to track down the Guardians by the Sovereign race. So first off, Chris Pratt is at his best as always as Peter Quill/Star Lord. Zoe Saldana is fearless as always as Gamora. Dave Bautista as Drax is funnier than ever in this film. Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel are great as always as Rocket Raccoon and newly born Baby Groot. I was really glad we got to see a little more of Rocket's skills in this movie. Michael Rooker's Yondu I was also glad to have a little more backstory and screentime in this film than he had in the first Guardians of the Galaxy as well as Karen Gillian as Nebula. Kurt Russell as Ego was perfect casting. Pom Klementieff as Mantis was probably the most interesting character of the film.

347,29 April 2017,Jim-Eadon,6," Fun, but the magic of the first movie has gone
","The first Guardians movie was fantastic, it made me laugh more than just about any other and I simply love that movie. This movie felt completely different, the movie makers were trying too hard and the magic slipped through their fingers. The first movie had an easy charm, it worked because it was fresh, original and they nailed the characters. Here they laid on the family-relationships stuff way too thick. It was not so much a comedy as a soap opera with corny lines. The chemistry between the lead couple was gone. And who cared about the sisters' squabbles? All of this felt laboured. Family this, family that, it felt as if we were being emotionally manipulated rather than entertained. Even Rocket was dragged into this over-egged family theme. The villain (SPOILER) didn't seem evil, rather, just a lonely, sad old God. The movie made us really like him and then tried to get us to hate him. It didn't work. Stallone made an unwelcome appearance, he snapped me out of the movie. The first movie worked precisely because it didn't feel like a Hollywood movie, as opposed to ""Expendables"" nonsense of trying-to-be-cool-with-the-youth comedy stuff. This movie, Guardians 2, started great but ended horribly, with criminals making a firework display, complete with bangs in space. And some flaky skits in the credits. The first movie was so funny, for me at least, largely because of Rocket, a genius comic creation. But here Rocket was sidelined, in favour of all the soppy soap stuff. And his comedy in this movie seemed a bit forced. The ""Taserface"" joke wasn't funny. The villain may have been called Ego, but Ego could have been the name of this entire movie. On the other hand, the opening credits and fight with the octopus fish monster were hilarious, (though I wanted to see more of the out-of-focus monster, and not the dancing plant, but that was part of the clever joke) but after that, the laughs were few and far apart, and as for the cheese: ""He was your father but not your daddy"" Eh? With the resources spend on this movie, they could have tightened it up, ditched the pointless sisters side plot - and coming to think of it - the lame metrosexual gold-people plot - and added in comedy in the style of the first movie, and stopped trying to press all the emotional buttons all the time, hell, one of the characters actually did that literally, in a manner of speaking, with her antenna.",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

What worked most about the first movie was the whole team working together as a team and in this movie that happens at the beginning and the end of the movie and in my opinion those are the best parts of the movie, Yes there is enjoyment to be had in the middle of the movie but that is for only one story which is yondu rocket and baby groot's story but the rest of the stories are just not interesting sadly. But there is still some enjoyment to be had in this movie and the cast all once again give a great performance as there characters and the villain is pretty good and interesting.

","The continuing adventures of Marvel's raggiest, taggiest team of interstellar misfits. This one picks up right where the first volume left off, with the gang collecting bounties from odd alien races, taking missteps (and making enemies) despite themselves. I loved the first one, consider it one of the best the MCU has to offer, and this sequel is right on the same level. Unabashedly chaotic, recklessly entertaining, cheeky and silly, emotive and sweet, it touches many of the same nerves that made the original so well-liked and even goes a step or two further. Given such a quirky, offbeat opening take, there's always the risk that sequels will come off as forced or derivative, but that isn't the case here. The humor still feels sharp and appropriate, the core cast shares the camaraderie (and constant personality clashes) of a real family, the greater universe remains intensely deep and well-populated. And there's still plenty of time to develop ancillary characters, be they new foils or uneasy old allies. In fact, one such dose of potent character development efficiently shifts a minor player from the first act into a significant part of the story this time around. Quick with wit and with the cannons, never afraid to let its inner weirdness shine like a beacon, brimming with vibrant life in every scene, it's vast and rich and sprawling and completely enjoyable.

377,10 June 2017,NateWatchesCoolMovies,8," Better than the first
","James Gunn's Guardians Of The Galaxy Volume 2, I'm happy to report, blows the first film right out of the water. There's a subversive, wonderfully sarcastic sense of humour running through both films, as well as a boundlessly creative and colourful canvas of ideas both big and small, coalescing into something just this side of chaos. Picture a stick of dynamite; Volume one is the fuse, fizzling terrifically as it gets off to a great start. In many franchises, by the time the first film uses up the wick and reaches the stick, it's sequel, the energy is lost and we end up with a dud of a follow-up. Not this baby. Volume two is the stick of dynamite, exploding gloriously across our screens in fits of dazzling imagination, humour that doesn't quit for a nanosecond and the heart to back it up. Volume one dipped its toe in the water and showed us the roots of what a great space opera might look like, and volume two plunges in to give us just that. We rejoin with the merry band of misfits who now know each other a little better, are more comfortable working as a unit, and blast off into a tale of space battles, living planets and perpetual banter. Chris Pratt's Star Lord, equipped with a brand new eight track collection of vintage pop songs, is still searching for his real dad when he kind of finds him by accident in the form of Ego, a powerful celestial being slyly played by Kurt Russell. Joining him are the gang we know and love, broccoli hued babe Gamora (Zoe Saldana), deadpan Drax (Dave Bautista outdoes himself in the comic relief department, a true highlight) Rocket (Bradley Cooper, excellent), scowling smurfette Nebula (Karen Gillian), adorable Baby Groot (Vin Diesel, collecting a mortgage- eclipsing paycheque for literally doing nothing) and antihero Yondu (Michael Rooker). Rooker gets far, far more to do here than he did the second time around, becoming a fleshed out character with a terrific arc and a whole pile of scenes, a strong asset to the film. The villain here is way more compelling than Lee Pace's silly space vampire in Volume One, and I won't spoil anything but there's more than a few surprises. Kurt Russell's living planet is pure delicious eye candy, a vista to rival anything in Star Wars, Mass Effect or similar worlds, detailed and lovingly rendered. As per usual there are cameos, but surprisingly it's more than the obligatory laundry list of Where's Waldo fellow Marvel appearances. There are truly inspired name drops here and a few genre titans who show up, none of whom I'll give away except Sylvester Stallone. He's given an unassuming supporting role that he plays solidly without tongue in cheek or any hint of a gimmick, just an enjoyable little addition to the cast. James Gunn is a cinematic punk, cracking prudence right in the jaw, throwing caution to the wind and tirelessly churning out the kind of fresh, funny and irreverent films we want to see, scrappy crowd pleasers that people will actually remember, which lord knows is what Marvel needs to shake up their sometimes complacent, too comfortable aesthetic. The soundtrack is obviously a winner, and any film that uses Fleetwood Mac's The Chain as its main cue has pretty much already won me over. This will probably be the cornerstone of summer blockbuster season, it's just too much fun and has everything you'd want, with the dial cranked just past what we got the first time around in the best way possible.

","Guardians of the Galaxy 2 in my opinion does not surpass the original film however is not a let down at all. The second film managed to tie in a more interesting aspect about family and therefore becomes a much more self centered and confined film which may be a put off to some as in nothing really happens and everything is generally self contained with not much implications on the greater MCU. However as James Gunn has quoted he does want the Guardians to be mostly its own separate thing despite having to eventually join the Avengers in the Infinity War. Which is a creative choice that I fully support, granted what makes MCU great is its ability to tie in all these different characters a separate faction is a breath of fresh air and is a chance for audiences to just have fun without having to worry too much about the overall continuity.",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

","Greetings! Just came from a double-feature showing of the Guardians movies, Volume 1 and 2 together. In doing this I got to compare the first and the second movie with them both freshly in my mind, and I will say Vol 2 is the BETTER of the two movies. The first movie did introduce us to this universe and these characters, so therefore you will hear some people 'professional critics' complain that Volume 2 isn't as 'fresh' and the first movie. Well they are idiots for saying that because the first movie was the introduction to characters most people have never heard of. Remember when the first trailer came out and many people were like ""who the heck are these people? is Marvel pulling our leg?"". Volume 2 gets to get right into the action and the story without having to re-introduce all the characters again. The movie has bigger and better laughs and some very touching moments. The stand out characters in this film are definitely Yondu and Nebula. You find out what drives them and what shapes them and their life. The only downside to the movie is although it is 2 hours and 15 minutes long, it seems to go by way to quickly and I would have loved for it to have 20 minutes longer.",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

Also the scene where Rocket, Groot, Yondu, and Kraglin jumped 177 systems and their faces became distorted was hilarious. Lastly, once again, Drax and his stupidity stole the show, he is just hilarious. This movie also had a good plot. I thought it was cool how they tied in Peter's issue with losing his mother and not knowing who his father is.

Heck I even read a comment where someone said that the Guardians are better than the Avengers. I mean the characters not the movie but those same people who think that may put the movie higher than Avengers. Why? I'll never know. But I'll respect because they are cool characters. After saving Xandar from Ronan's wrath, the Guardians are now recognized as heroes. Now the team must help their leader Star Lord (Chris Pratt) uncover the truth behind his true heritage. Along the way, old foes turn to allies and betrayal is blooming. And the Guardians find that they are up against a devastating new menace who is out to rule the galaxy. I said I find the Guardians of The Galaxy (2014) to be over-rated and I don't like the opening of that film with Peter singing and kicking the little things that look like dinosaurs or actually more like raptors (I don't know what there called) because it was obviously played for laughs and was completely ridiculous. But the opening sequence where baby groot is running around while a battle is going on around him is pretty cool. I love the cast and Karen Gillian's Nebula is going through stake of survival so she can kill her father Thanos and her scene's with Gamora where sweet. Dave Bautista who is more that background physical actor and once admitted he's not that great actor was more fun this time around. Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana who play my favorite's Starlord and Gamora where amazing I loved there chemistry in this film. Especially Starlord who grows as character when he meets his father Ego the living planet played by Kurt Russel and I love the scene where he creates this blue celestial ball and they act like a regular father and son playing catch with it. Michael Rooker is my Mary Popins, that's all I'm going to say about him. It was cool to see Sylvester Stallone I hope he's in the next one a little bit more, oh and Seth Green returns as Howard The Duck I doubt you'll miss him he has a pretty cool line. The film is a lot more about family just like the recent few Fast & Furious movies, well I know what family I want to spend more time with. Guardians of The Galaxy Vol.2 has more heart, with astounding visuals that bring this massive space opera (which is far better than The Force Awakens by the way) and it tone's down the humor which thank goodness, this was an an amazing chapter in the massive Marvel Cinematic Universe, I loved this film way more than the first so I'm giving Guardians of The Galaxy Vol. 2 a five out of five.",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

","Guardians vol. 2 by far has the best opening of all the marvel movies. I could watch the opening for two hours and be totally content. The set pieces and colors are so clever and beautiful. The design of characters is fine art. The humor is stronger than the first mostly, sometimes the balance between dark drama and humor feels a little mismatched. And dare I say even the soundtrack is improved. All the characters feel like your friends, like you know them personally. And of course, acting legend Kurt Russel is a marvel villain force to be reckoned with. Shoot, Yondu proves to be one of the greatest marvel characters of all time here.
The great thing about this film is it's not so worried about setting up anything but just telling a story. Telling a story about the characters and letting you learn about them more and give you more of an emotional connection. James Gunn went all out on his trademark weirdness on this film, he truly claims it. It's even stranger than Doctor Strange. AND you get Sylvester Stallone in the marvel universe. What else could you really ask for. All the guardians are in full flux here. Theres no way you're not going to have a good time, and even possibly just feel something.

I also like how the whole thing kind of reminds me of classic 'Star Trek', Chris Pratt being, well, Kirk; Quill's, or Pratt-Kirk's, egotism being on a par with Pine-Kirk's from reboot Trek, but most obviously when flirting with Elizabeth Debecki's Ayesha shortly after the opening credits!

Drax is Drax and has some of the best lines. I am a long time fan of Kurt Russell and he did a good job as Ego but could have been made edgier, esp. as an enemy (was I looking for a good enemy?). Ayesha, the golden alien ruler and her video game playing subjects, did not make very good enemies (my enemy issues again?), but I did like the use of 80's computer game sounds for their virtual battles. I wanted more kick-ass Rocket Raccoon than I got. I usually complain about lack of character development which this sequel had in spades! Yondu got some quality time on screen and by the end of vol. 2 I wanted to see him in vol. 3...sigh. To solidify this ramble, vol 2 gave us much more of the characters we know and love but maybe had too little time to use them in a satisfying way.

Our Guardian's of the Galaxy this time end up on a new strange planet when they are invited there by a God-like man named EGO, who apparently is Peter Quills long lost father but things don't seem right & there's a big sinister plot & our heroes have to once again save the Galaxy. That's the basic storyline here & it's well done with some new faces on screen like two absolute legends of Cinema, Kurt Russell as Ego & Sylvester Stallone as an old ravenger who used to work with Yondu, named Stakar Ogord. Great having these two legends enter this MCU as i grew up watching & loving these guys & they starred together as partners in the Classic Action Cop Thriller ""Tango & Cash"" from way back in the 80's. Also there's much more emotional depth to all the characters this time & makes us care for this time & like them even more. Yondu (Played greatly again by Michael Rooker) has so much more depth to his rugged, angry & deadly Ravenger here that we get to understand him & find out what he's done for Peter Quill. Baby Groot is absolutely adorable & so cute that he steals the show & Peter Quill aka: Starlord gets much more emotional depth with his past catching up to him with a few surprises. All the characters get lots of time to shine here & even Rocket opens up more too!!!
The special effects are as always Amazing & the comedy is just right with plenty of fun comments & banter between our group & that's why is such a fun movie as we love to hang out with this group of misfits & the love of this team is on full display by the end.
A blast of thrilling adventure, stunning set pieces, witty humour, beautiful colourful cinematography, good music & lots of Action make this one great big budget blockbuster popcorn extravaganza.

","""Super"" writer/director James Gunn took moviegoers for an irreverent, interplanetary joyride, peppered with pop culture references, in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" back in 2014. Happily, Gunn's sequel ""Guardians of the Galaxy, Volume 2"" qualifies as just as impressive with several surprises. If you haven't seen ""GoTG, Vol. 1,"" then you may have problems putting both the swashbuckling characters and their outlandish backstory into context in this imaginative, science-fiction, follow-up saga. Good sequels always dig deeper into the original characters and conjure up newcomers. ""GoTG, Vol. 2"" reassembles the same quintet and scrutinizes them in greater detail. Peter Quill, ostensibly the Guardians' leader, catches up with his enigmatic sire, Ego, and father and son surprise each other with their goals during the second act. We learn that Ego has been searching the universe for his long, lost son. Later, Yondu observes astutely about the grandiose Ego: ""He may have been your father, Quill, but he wasn't your daddy."" This father and son connection yields the ultimate surprise, too, but discretion prevents me from divulging specifics. The peculiar relationship that Quill has forged with Yondu Udonta, the extraterrestrial space pirate who abducted Quill from Earth after the lad fled from the hospital where his cancer-stricken mom died takes on an added dimension. No character changes as much in ""GoTG 2"" as Yondu. He evolves from a lowlife villain to an individual of integrity. Meanwhile, sibling rivalry keeps Quill's quasi-girlfriend Gamora locked into a never-ending feud with her jealous sister Nebula. Nebula hates Gamora with a passion because their evil stepfather Thanos preferred Gamora over her. Smutty-mouthed Rocket Raccoon remains as obnoxious as ever, but his bad-tempered attitude thaws during the third act. Good sequels send off the characters onto exciting new adventures against different villains. The Guardians are summoned to a remote corner of the cosmos again. The new aliens—the Sovereigns—constitute a petulant people with little sense of humor. When the Rocket infuriates them, the latter pursue the Guardians with a vengeance until greater powers interfere.",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 had an absurd Hype, much of it obviously for the first film that is very good, and without a doubt top 5 best films of this cinematic universe of Marvel, and I was very excited, until leaving the trailer, of all Trailer of this movie I found everyone weak, and trailer is something important, but I hoped that at the time of the movie would be different and unfortunately I was very disappointed in the film, a superhero movie does not have to be something complex or so different, but it is a plot Zoe Saldana as Gamora is the best thing about this film, its relation with the Nebula, played by Karen Gillan. Is the best part of the movie, but the other arch are very annoying, Dave Bautista like Drax I found it very annoying in this movie and also in the past, it was a lot better, it even annoys his innocence, The Groot I think it's cool that he was just a baby, Kurt Russel, that Ego Peter Quill's father disappointed me, his scenes are very problematic, and his relationship with Quill did not convince me, and Michael Rooker As Yondu commands very well, Yondu next to Gamora are the best characters of the film, the outcome of the film is very good, I liked it a lot, not to mention that it is very exciting too, but the film has a serious problem of tone, sometimes He tries to mix a lot, the comedy of the film is very exaggerated, in the first film he was well balanced, in that it is very exaggerated, not to mention that they want to put music everywhere and this is very annoying in my opinion, and sometimes a scene that Was to be dramatic or epic and spoiled by it, the direction of James Gunn is good in some aspects, but he leaves it to be desired in others, the CGI of the film is well done, and the script is a bit confusing, sometimes happens a lot Thing in a short time, the film has 5 scenes post-credits and 4 of them Are unnecessary, only 1 was interesting, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 can please anyone who loves this formula of marvel, but in my opinion is one of the worst movie in the universe of Marvel, I hope that if you have a third party they do not exaggerate in jokes outside Hour.

","The first film based on the Marvel Comics was a huge cinematic success, so expectations were high for the return of the group of superheroes in the sequel, directed by James Gunn (Slither, Super). Basically, the Guardians of the Galaxy: Peter Quill aka Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Spectre's Dave Bautista), Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Groot, now Baby Groot (Vin Diesel) successfully defended Xander from Ronan the Accuser. The Guardians next successfully protect valuable batteries from an inter- dimensional monster, for Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki), High Priestess and leader of the Sovereign race, in exchange for her prisoner, Gamora's estranged sister Nebula (Doctor Who's Karen Gillan), who attempted to steal the batteries, but was caught. But Rocket steals batteries for himself, a fleet of drones from the Sovereign attack the Guardians' ship, a mysterious figure destroys the remaining drones, but the Guardians crash-land on a nearby planet. Later this mysterious figure reveals himself, ancient Celestial being Ego (Kurt Russell), who also reveals he is Peter's biological father, he invites his son, accompanied by Gamora and Drax, to his home, while Rocket and Groot remain to repair the ship and guard Nebula. Yondu Udonta (Slither's Michael Rooker) and his crew were exiled from the greater Ravager community for child trafficking, Ayesha hires Yondu and his crew to recapture the Guardians, they successfully capture Rocket, but Yondu is reluctant to turn over Quill. Nebula convinces Yondu's lieutenant Taserface (Chris Sullivan) and a mutiny to release her, imprison Rocket and Yondu, execute Yondu's loyalists, and assist her to track down and kill Gamora, who Nebula blames for the torture inflicted on her by their father Thanos. While imprisoned on Yondu's ship, Rocket and Yondu bond, Groot and Yondu loyalist Kraglin (Sean Gunn) free them, destroy the ship and kill the crew as they escape, though not before Taserface tips off the Sovereign fleet. Ego explains that he is one of the god-like Celestials, he exists in the form of the planet on which they are standing, he assumed the form of a human to travel the universe and interact with other species, eventually coming to Earth, meeting and falling in love with Quill's mother Meredith (Laura Haddock). After Meredith's death, Ego paid Yondu to collect the young Peter, but he never delivered his son, he had been searching for him ever since, Ego teaches Peter to manipulate Celestial power. Nebula arrives at Ego's planet and attempts to kill Gamora, she fails, after a fight between them the pair reach an uneasy alliance, discovering skeletal remains filling the caverns of the planet. Ego reveals to Peter that in his travels to thousands of world, he planted seedlings upon many of the planets, capable of terraforming into new extensions of himself, but they can only be activated by the power of a second Celestial. Ego impregnated countless women to give to birth to children who would be able to access the power, all failed, so Ego killed them, until he found Peter. Ego uses his son's power the activate the seedlings, which begin to consume the worlds they inhabit, Peter is hypnotised into helping his father, but fights back after Ego reveals he deliberately created the cancer that killed his mother. Ego's pet empath Mantis (Pom Klementieff), who can feel emotions from touching a person, has grown close to Drax, she warns him, Gamora and Nebula of Ego's plan, then Rocket, Yondu, Groot and Kraglin arrive. The reunited Guardians reach the planet core, where Ego's brain is housed, they also fight off Sovereign drones, Rocket creates a bomb from the stolen bomb and instructs Groot to plant it on Ego's brain, while Quill battle Ego with his newfound Celestial capabilities, allowing the Guardians to escape. The bomb explodes, killing Ego and causing the planet to disintegrate, Yondu sacrifices himself to save Quill, he realises Yondu spared him as a child from the fate of Ego's other offspring, he was Quill's true ""daddy"". In the end, Gamora and Nebula reconcile, but Nebula still chooses to set out to find and kill Thanos, a funeral is held for Yondu, attended by dozens of Ravager ships, while the Guardians set out to continue their protection of the galaxy; Groot is growing back to normal size, being a bratty teenager; Ayesha has created a new artificial being, named Adam, to destroy the Guardians. Also starring Sylvester Stallone as Stakar Ogord, Tommy Flanagan as Tullk, Farscape's Ben Browder as Sovereign Admiral, Rob Zombie as Unseen Ravager, Gregg Henry as Grandpa Quill, Seth Green as Howard the Duck, Ving Rhames as Charlie-27, Michelle Yeoh as Aleta Ogord, Miley Cyrus as Mainframe, David Hasselhoff and Stan Lee as Astronaut. Pratt is still a wisecracking hero with ""Awesome Mix"" cassette tapes, but he also gets to be vulnerable, Saldana as the green-skinned warrior is still cool, fuzzy fast-talking sidekick Cooper is still fun, along with Diesel as the now younger walking tree partner who only says ""I am Groot"", Russell is a good choice as the father with a dark agenda, and there is good support from Gillan and Rooker. The plot is pretty easy to follow, the lead hero finds their origins, only to find out later his father has plans for galactic domination, the high octane chase and fight sequences, and CGI and makeup special effects are most impressive, and the soundtrack of more ""awesome"" songs is great, including ""Mr. Blue Sky"" - Electric Light Orchestra, ""The Chain"" - Fleetwood Mac, ""Bring It on Home to Me"" - Sam Cooke and ""Father and Son"" - Cat Stevens, a really enjoyable, fun science-fiction action adventure.

As I said: the humor is great and director Gunn manages to create a visceral and unique film in terms of esthetics. But...there is something wrong with the plot and story here. GotG1 was a straightforward mission like film. Here...there really is no mission. Just our heroes hanging about. The middle act kinda drags on (especially the Ego sequences) and the finale feels a bit like a rehash of the Dr Strange climax (visually that is).

When it was announced that they would be bringing the Guardians of the Galaxy, a relatively obscure, space-dwelling gang of misfits to the big screen, to some this seemed like their biggest risk yet, and one that could stop the Marvel Cinematic Universe in its tracks.

","GuardiansVol. 2 will definitely please fans of the first film (i.e. basically everyone) in the irreverent space-saga. Sure, it's bigger spectacled and deeper themed, but its real strength lies in its smaller moments of character and humor. In fact, when the words being spoken aren't jokes, corny exposition and telegraphed subtext sneak to the surface (""Sometimes we don't realize what we need is right there all along.""). Thankfully, director Gunn deftly redeems each less-than-stellar story moment with cheeky jokes and surprising humanity. If the first was New Hope, then Vol. 2 is Empire, as we find Starlord (Pratt) dealing with his own daddy issues (Russell), as the universe at large is fighting a bigger (though possibly related) battle. The action scenes have cinematic flair and dramatic heft, but the charm is still 100% dependent upon its tongue being so firmly placed in its cheek in subversive and unexpected ways. The music is a smile-inducing mix of 70s and 80s power pop, Rocket is still drolly hot-headed, Drax is still hilariously literal, Baby Groot is adorably violent, and new addition Mantis fits in snugly. So why isn't this consider among Marvel's best for me? Well, as a longtime Marvel Studios zombie, I hate to admit it, but these MCU outings are finally starting to feel a bit same-y. Lots of parental problems, brightly colored CGI, a standard build in impressive action scenes to a final with the Big Boss, all punctured with good-natured humor. Luckily, the formula is a good one, and with Guardians, what it lacks in dramatic intrigue, it makes up for with irreverence for its own seriousness, helping it stand out from the larger superhero pack.",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

The soundtrack is apt, the jokes are the right kind of nerdy and every character gets their due, they get an arc full of pathos, connection, humour and depth. Absolutely every one of the main characters had me crying out from beneath my 3D glasses throughout. The emotion is rich, relatable and raw and I appreciated it. I mean just the way the movie ends and the interconnectivity of all the plot machinations are warranted and welcome.
The effects, battles, and shooting never felt rushed or cheap. Everything fired on all cylinders with a care and love throughout. The plot was personal and minimal as it should be and the way it was made global was sensible and simple. The stakes couldn't have been higher because they were personal and they didn't need a sky portal to do it.
Even the references I didn't get were welcome little injokes rather than complete set ups for other movies that played in to the tone of the movie. Mantis is excellent and Drax is almost the most hilarious which is saying something. The pacing and the structure of the battles were coherent and made creative use of everyday new skill sets. The film had me in stitches throughout and the potential of Volume 3 and the next iteration of Groot is certainly an appealing one.
The depth effects of the 3D, after he litany of terrible post conversions I've seen, was consistent, pleasurable throughout and extraordinary well done and for one actually enhanced the experience.
This film should be added to the annals of time as the exact right kind of blockbuster sequel that builds upon its predecessors shoulders to create something unique and memorable that was both economical, brisk and yet deep and seemingly never compromised.",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

The songs are more poetic this time around and fit the subtext of the film perfectly. The trailers gave me the feel of the first movie; a straight-up Sci-fi action-comedy with a simple point A to B plot. GotGV2 is so much MORE than this! This film is patient with its characters and there is an emphasis on growth and family. It manages to balance 7-8 characters and gives almost all of them a satisfactory emotional arc. There is so much to chew on here with the issues and motifs felt by certain characters and I applaud that! This film is vastly different and I'm glad because I just love these characters so much!

Still what I liked most of it was the great twists in the second half and that it was able to answer or react on many unsolved questions from part one and was still able to surprise and be unpredictable. The cast once again did a good job. Chris Pratt was once again proving to be the ideal actor to portray that character. The voice job of Bradley Cooper even better than in part 1. Zoe Saldana had her moments and I really loved Dave Baustia here who got way more to do and had some really scene stealing moments. Kurt Russell was ideally cast. Sylvester Stallone a bit wasted but I guess we will see more of him in future films of the franchise. The best of the cast was probably Michael Rooker. The effects and look was really exceptional. A bit overblown, especially in the first half, but really impressive nevertheless. The soundtrack was also great, even more effective than in the first film which I found surprising.

It was at once a travelogue, an adventure story and an ensemble piece that smartly borrowed from golden-age blockbuster ephemera to give us something truly ballsy for the time. The fact that the potential franchise was yet another loop in the Marvel Cinematic Universe's rapidly expanding armor was but the icing on a very fulfilling and very expensive cake.",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

","Yeah, I said what I had to say in the subject line. I have a question about this movie. After the Guardians ship crash lands on Berhart, (prob spelling that wrong) Quill and Gamora have a private talk with one another where Gamora brings up the David Hasselhoff story that Quill told her someone before when he was drunk. The two were by themselves with nobody around at all. HOWEVER, later on in the movie when Quill realizes that Ego killed his Mother and knows what Ego's plan is, he attacks Ego. When Ego recovers, he changes his ""human form"" to David Hasselhoff. How the hell did he know to change himself to look like the Hoff!?!?!? This means that he somehow heard the private conversation between Quill and Gamora or just blindly guessed; and I HIGHLY DOUBT that Ego just guessed that. It's a small nit-pick but it does kinda bother me lol. Btw, does anybody have an explanation for this???",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

A melting pot of a bunch of old SF movie plots blended into what's going to be largely hard to understand for a lot of people not already enraptured by SF or the Marvel Universe. Our heroes start out doing what they always do: taking on impossible tasks and succeeding. Then pissing everyone off and becoming goats. The movie then fractures into many, many subplots. There are not one but two father/son-issues subplots. There's the men-become-gods cliché trope (calling Gary Mitchell). There's the rival siblings subplot. There are not one but two budding romances. There's the inferiority complex of a goodhearted character who pushes away his friends so he won't get hurt by them. There's the evil-but-goodhearted space pirates plot.

Bringing back the death of Peter's mother again, did feel a bit forced. Then, the villain was Peter's dad? And a planet, i guess?

This sequel does not have the novelty of the initial film but the reprising of style will ensure that it is another massive success.

","Great fun filled movie, fantastic special effects, a good follow on from the first. Kurt Russell as Ego was genius casting as he has that slightly arrogant, self satisfied look that was perfect for Ego. Baby Groot was brilliant and the glimpse of teen Groot in the post credits was so spot on accurate for those ""whatever"" years I laughed out loud. I thought each character was developed nicely and it certainly makes you want to see more of all of them. My only gripe was the excessive killing. The scene of the whistle arrow massacre on board ship just trivialised death to a comedic level, not necessary and not nice. Are we meant to laugh as hundreds are killed and then cry as one individual dies? This certainly makes it entirely unsuitable for viewers less than middle teens. I admit to a tear at the funeral scene, whether in reaction to hearing Father and Son or the character's death or a mix I'm not sure but it was a scene of loss and love well done. However the overall sense of fun and humour was great - the Hoff's brief appearance; the effect of excessive clicks in space travel; the hitch of the rolled out carpet for the Sovereign queen; Rocket's leaping bodies; the Blob like appearance of Ego's takeover (remember that crazy Steve McQueen's movie from the 50s) - and so many more moments had me in stitches. Whatever you do don't miss this on the big screen.

","After retrieving some valuable batteries to the Sovereign race the Guardians of the Galaxy are compensated in the process by having a female outlaw named ""Nebula"" (Karen Gillan) handed over to them. As it so happens, Nebula was imprisoned by the Sovereign race because she had tried to steal the same batteries that the Guardians have safely returned. Additionally, Nebula just happens to be the estranged sister of ""Gamora"" (Zoe Saldana) as well. In any case, after the Guardians of the Galaxy depart they soon discover that one of their own members has kept some of the batteries for himself-and because of that they are now the targets of the same people who had employed them earlier. To make matters even more complicated, while trying to escape from the Sovereigns they encounter a man named ""Ego"" (Kurt Russell) who claims to be the father of ""Peter Quill"" (Chris Pratt). But what they don't realize is that Ego has a secret agenda that he only plans to reveal when the time is right. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that-as in the first movie-fans who enjoy lots of CGI and action will probably love this particular film. And while I was quite impressed with the CGI, I must admit that-once again-I didn't consider this movie to be as good as the marketing and hype surrounding it. To further elaborate, I found the acting to be rather mediocre and I didn't think that the humor was very sharp either. That being said, while it wasn't necessarily a bad movie by any means, I thought it could have been much better and I have rated it accordingly.

Zoe Saldana as Gamora is even in green a beautiful woman to watch. The only minor point that I would mention is Chris Pratt. I just think he is a below average actor, he's just mediocre. Too bad they didn't choose somebody else to play the role of Peter Quill. For a sequel the story is certainly not bad, but it's more about the visual effects and the humor.

607,10 November 2017,jamesrupert2014,7," Pretty good, for a CGI-driven sequel...
","Like most sequels, ""Guardians of the Galaxy 2"" lacks the freshness and novelty of the original. The main characters, while still entertaining, are a bit predictable, having had their shtick well established in #1. The primary villain continues the trend for 'super-heroes' to be combating some kind of god-like foe, (presumably mundane villains are no longer sufficiently challenging), which allows the special effects/CGI teams to pretty much include any image that they find interesting (or easily rendered(?)). The film is fast moving and colourful (although I am getting tired of space looking tie-died – a little of that goes a long way) but the images come so fast that it's difficult to really get any real sense of at what you are looking. The climactic battle is overlong and confusing, being full of the 'swarms of ships' that is so popular in the current crop of CGI-driven movies. These criticisms aside, GotG2 is fun entry in to the movie Marvelverse. Michael Rooker's 'Udonta' returns and is put to good use, the new character, Ego's empath-servant Mantis, is a worthwhile addition to the story, and there is lots of quality Rocket time (I liked the scenes where the furry mercenary takes on an army of Ravagers).

","GOTG Vol. 2 went bigger with the action and the set-pieces. The soundtrack is an excellent follow to the first movie's mixtape. It had a far more interesting villain than the first (played by Kurt Russell). They explored some very interesting character traits and dynamics. Most notably the relationships between Rocket and Yondu, Gamora and Nebula, and Peter and Ego. James Gunn so clearly crafted this film with love and adoration for all these characters and the entire cast shines on screen. Some tiring comedy bits drag the film a little bit but it doesn't hurt the film too much overall.

The true villain however is Star-Lord's Quill's (Chris Pratt) finally discovered father Ego (what a name!) played by the inimitable Kurt Russell. He has every right to claim that name as he is a ""celestial"", that is a god, with a small ""g"" as he humbly adds.

","Review: I really enjoyed this movie, just like the first one, and I couldn't help laughing through the whole of the first half. The witty script worked extremely well, and the crazy soundtrack, along with a decent storyline, made this epic sequel a must watch. The movie kicks off with the Guardians of the Galaxy saving the world, once again, and when they go to give the Golden Queen, Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki), some precious batteries, Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) decides to steal them back, and they end up on the run from Ayesha's soldiers. With nowhere to go, and there ship under severe attack, a little man comes out of nowhere, and destroys all of the ships that are attacking them. When they finally land the ship in the middle of nowhere, they are approached by Peter Quills (Chris Pratt), dad Ego (Kurt Russell), who takes them to his Wonderland, which amazes them all. Gamora (Zoe Saldana) finds the whole situation a bit weird, while Drax (Dave Bautista) bonds with Ego's righthand girl Mantis (Pom Klementieff). After listening to his dads plans for the future, and the reasons why he left his mum, Peter soon realises that his dad has an inner evil, which isn't good for the world, so the Guardians are forced into battle against the evil Ego. There are many other elements to the film but that is the core of the movie. With such a deep backdrop, including the evil Queen and the Ravagers going wild, the comedy was top class, and baby groot was a brilliant addition to the crew. You can definitely see were every penny of the budget went, especially with the CGI characters, and the action scenes were also pretty impressive. The first scene, were the Guardians are fighting the big monster, was put together extremely well, and it was a great opening to a great franchise. I think you can tell that I really enjoyed this film, and I can't wait for the 3rd movie. Great!",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

We are in the endgame. They have announced more movies, which you know are going to be horrible, they even announced some shows, which again you know are going to be horrible.

True, some sections seemed to lack direction, but overall I found it to be a success. I can say the film had better action sequences (Yondu's tour-de-force is something to see) than the first . The story felt like a real story, with a purpose and driven by emotions and wants. Rocket seemed lightweight though, even though he had quite a bit of screen time, I think his lack of emotional engagement with others is what made him a lesser character. The same applies to Baby Groot. Towards the end Rocket does begin connecting, but that may play out more in future films. The trailers had Drax being funnier than he is in the film itself. In the film, he is more of an action man. Finding out a bit about his back story helps his character development too. Marvel are on a delicious slow burn leading up to the Infinity War.

","The film is the long-awaited continuation of the adventures of the most atypical of the teams in the Marvel Universe. It includes such characters as: Star-Lord - Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket Rocket Raccoon (original character voice acting from Bradley Cooper) and of course the cutest creature in the Groot universe who, after the events of the first part, became Baby Groot (he was originally voiced by Vin Diesel). Not without replenishment of the composition with new characters in the face of the devastator Yondu Udont (Michael Rooker), his deputy Kraglin (Sean Gunn) and the adopted daughter of Thanos, Gamora's sister - Nebula (Karen Gillan). In comparison with the first part, the film pushes the general interaction of the team into the background and shows the personalities of the characters, their characters and problems, and the plot is based on family values. The viewer is shown the relationship between Peter and the father of Ego (Kurt Russell), who suddenly appeared after so much time, who has his own planet on which there is not a soul except for his servant - the empath Mantis. The relationship between the sisters Gamora and Nebula. Drax who became part of this team has changed and become less gloomy. ""Rocket"" who takes care of baby Groot, and repels everyone else around him (a kind of egoist who wants to be paid attention and loved). Yonudu who not only raised Peter and replaced his father, he became one. With all this, the picture is still filled with cool 80s music, great action, a huge number of Easter eggs and references, humor (sometimes adult and on the edge but funny), and a cool main villain who was not spoiled in trailers. As a result, my rating is 5 out of 5, the MARVEL studio once again showed everyone that at the moment they are a cut above in comic book adaptations than everyone else.",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

The 2014 film, in my opinion, is very nice and the humor works, but there are some problems in the technical part of the production (the CGI is particularly mediocre) and some performances in the main group are not so good. For example, Chris Pratt, despite being a charismatic protagonist, in that movie sounded rather pedantic and one-note, with the music tossing and the comedic tirades, just like the Rocket. But here things are much sharper, I think that the space of 3 years between one and the other has benefited, it gave the actors time to find themselves better in their roles, and the track is less excessive.

","The first one is much much better. This is almost a farce. The plot is wafer thin and a lot of the dialog was cringe worthy. I've not seen all the MCU movies, but they're on Disney+ and I've been watching them in chronological order. I stopped this movie around halfway through just to write this review. The only thing I can think is someone made bet, how bad can we make this movie and still rake in a profit? I'm glad I didn't see it in the theater. The visuals are the best part, if you don't care about the plot and the dialog, the visuals probably looked incredible on the big screen. My rating of six is based on the visuals. I'd give this movie maybe a 4 for the plot and dialog. I'm going to try to finish this movie, since I figure something in here is going to carry over to a subsequent MCU movie. Think of the MCU as a book, this movie is one of the many chapters and to follow the book one has to read all the chapters or you miss something in the storyline.",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

740,14 April 2019,vault-57100,9," A near masterpiece.
","Marvel has come an incredibly long way since the 2000's, when it first entered the cinematic scene with movies such as ""HULK"" and the original ""Spiderman"" trilogy staring Toby McGuire. Watching Volume two, it is incredibly hard to believe how far the Marvel Cinematic Univers has come. Directed by James Gunn, volume two is as close to a masterpiece as one can get. Volume two was a comedic action filled sci-fi extravaganza, a roller coaster of emotions and a compelling story about overcoming the demons within one's own families, because families are far more than mere friendship or kinship could ever hope to be. Breaking the film down, one can truly assess these aspects of the movie that could truly be considered master-strokes in a near perfect film.
From light-hearted humor at stupid, laughable names such as ""Taser-Face"", to crude humor such as Drax reminiscing about the love of his life and how her stoic, lifeless expressions made his ""nether regions engorge,"" Volume 2 has a joke for nearly everyone's tastes. This can most vividly be noted in the beginning sequence of the film, where the guardians are facing off against an inter-dimensional creature dead-set on feeding on Anulax batteries on the planet Sovereign. One would expect the battle to be incredibly intense, and the focus of the opening sequence. But this isn't the case, as the entire battle is displayed in the background, and at the forefront is none other than Baby Groot dancing to upbeat 80's music while the world is in chaos around him. Through this sequence alone, it is easy to see what the rest of the film has in store for the audience, a humor filled action sci-fi adventure the likes of which had never been seen before, and an incredible installment to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).
For those looking for a deeper story that tugs at the heart strings, they needn't look further either, as volume two has it all. Everyone has been at odds with there family oat some point of their life, some way more so than others. James Gunn understands this and uses this to it's fullest potential. Every main protagonist in volume two has had to deal with some heavy stuff. (Spoilers ahead!) This is best exemplified by Yondu and Rocket as they were both discarded by the people who conceived them, and even had an altercation where Yondu confronts rocket about his personality and why he pushes everyone away, stating he knows everything about rocket "" I know who you are boy! 'Cus you're me!"" Familial drama is always a touchy subject, yet Gunn lays the problem out bare for the audience to relate to. (Spoilers End)
Volume two is not perfect, but it's damn near close. It's comical, visceral yet deep, and is overall an exceptionally well-made film. It would be disrespectful to not recommend this film to anyone who loves comics and the MCU if they haven't already seen it yet.",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

Vol. 2 only expands on that sense of connection as it reveals the series' biggest secret to date -- the identity of Peter Quill's father -- that in turn only prompts more questions and, unsurprisingly, a whole lot of wickedly fun action and more great tunes.

But here's the thing... it's WAY too long, and there are a LOT of sequences when nothing much happens, or if it does you don't really care. The plot is fairly ridiculous, but then it's a Marvel film so you're not expecting Hitchcock. At times it does moralise a LOT about families and family values and all that, and fair enough families are important, but it gets a bit sappy in parts. The good points are the action sequences, and there are a fair few of them, Rocket has much more screen time this time (a good thing), and Baby Groot is cute. Drax's character though only just about comes off this time, and Quill is a tad wasted in his parts. So is it worth a couple of hours of your time? Well... it would definitely be worth 90 minutes or so, for sure. My cousin and I just thought that over 2 hours stretched things too far. In addition to which if you're wanting to hear ""Fox On The Run"", which we were, it's not in the film at all, unless you count the end credits, and a long way down in those...",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

","Flawed certainly if you're expecting a reprise of part 1 but certainly brilliant in the special effects which are extravagant and mind-numbingly overwhelming. The plot, minimal as it is, continues the saga of the first film but otherwise follows predictable sci-fi/comic-derived paths; character development is also minimal and phony, personal interactions and situations are sentimental and boring used mainly to provide relief from the near constant barrage of sound and explosive visuals; music is triumphal or soft and flowing as befits the screen action. It's also flawed in the sense that they tried to incorporate some of the features that made the 1st film such a surprise and delight: the sparkling, inventive dialogue with its outrageous puns and allusions to the 70's occurs in part 2 but now it's thrown in out of context and totally bewildering in terms of its meaning. Similarly the cassette of 70's music and some songs of the era make predictable appearances but in a casual, pointed and rather nonsensical way. Part 2 takes itself seriously like many other ""save humanity from aliens"" features whereas Part 1 was whimsical and lighthearted where Part 2 is angry, driven and almost brutal at times. I gave Part 2 6 for the captivating, riveting special effects but the other 4 are lost for trying to incorporate features of Part 1 that no longer fit.

Personally, I found the structure a little uncomfortable. I expected that like the first installment and the other Marvel films, that the focus throughout the story would be on an a group of heroes eliminating a great threat. Unfortunately the main antagonist is revealed way too late in the story, leaving the characters rather aimless throughout most of the film. As a result the plot meanders into the territory of sketch show and t.v. drama, but fortunately, still manages to deliver a great final punchline. Although the action, effects and comedy are all very enjoyable, I couldn't help but wonder where it was all leading. Although the story evolves into quite a satisfying conclusion, about two thirds of the way through the film the absence of direction made me worry that the film would end up being a complete mess.

","The first Guardians of the Galaxy movie is one of the most popular comic book movies thus far, with its memorable cast of colorful characters, spectacular visuals, and pop culture references from the 1980s. The Guardians return here for another adventure, where Star-Lord meets his father, Ego. The strength of the first movie was how this band of drastically different characters functions, which the second movie builds on successfully. It explores character relationships in pairs - we see interaction between Star-Lord and Ego, Gamora and Nebula, Rocket and Yondu, and Drax and Mantis. It's just as action-packed and funny as the first movie, but they spend most of it separated. In addition, Ego is one of the MCU's best villains so far, with a good performance by Kurt Russell, an interesting backstory, and an awesome set of powers. The twist with him at the end was totally unexpected (in a good way). Much like the first movie, the soundtrack and visual effects are highlights. The theme of music from the 80's continues, with the likes of Fleetwood Mac and the Electric Light Orchestra having songs featured in the film. The visual effects were spectacular, from the space battles to the planets, especially Ego's planet. The problem with it is that it feels like it's just trying to get the Guardians more screen time before Infinity War, making it seem like filler material for the MCU's overall story. The first Guardians movies introduced the Power Stone and gave Thanos more screen time than any other before Infinity War, so it was rather surprising to not see it connect to the overall story with the Infinity Stones, and have it not connect to Thanos. And a lot of people were upset at how drastically Mantis differed from her comic book persona. While I see the two as entirely different characters, it makes sense that that would upset long-time fans of the Guardians. Still, for fans of Marvel or comic book movies, this is a must watch. It's definitely a worthy addition to the MCU, even if it's not as memorable of important to the MCU's overall story than the first one.",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

","The went beyond the Vol 1 which itself laid a great impact upon the viewers with it's storyline and acting. Guardians have consolidated there place while the little Groot grows but this is not what the sovereigns want. 
The little Groot is a cute one that takes your attention from time to time; the comical part played by Rocket is commendable.....Taserface....haha. And who can forget Drax that makes out the best of comments at the right time and never gets back in embarrassing others.
The story is interesting one wherein Quill is happy to find his father on one hand but on the other finds difficult to protect the Guardians on revelation of his true identity. The Macho role played by Yondu was also commendable and so was his sacrifice in the end.

I would say that this sequel probably has even more humor and laugh out loud moments than the first. Also, baby Groot just puts a smile on your face every second he's on the screen. However, parts of the movie just seemed a bit too overblown and it felt like it was maybe 10 minutes too long. I'm all for long movies, but that third act just seemed to go on a bit longer than it needed to and the non-stop barrage of special effects action was kind of exhausting by the end.

","This movie is every bit as fun and exciting as the first. Right from the opening credits, you're hit with same kind of punch that Gunn dealt with the original. For the first third of this movie, I would say it hit you left and right, joke after joke, and that's what I liked the most. It focused mainly on the camaraderie of this group. What sells the first Guardians of the Galaxy for me is the chemistry between the group, and the back-and-forth they all have. The way Gunn writes these characters, and how he layers the dialogue to create a perfect symphony is incredible. And we got that for the first third of this movie. Then, the characters split up. While what each of them were doing was interesting enough, that camaraderie and that chemistry was missing. It left a hole in the movie, and the static energy of go go go came to a halt. I don't think these characters are compelling enough on their own. If we ever got a Drax (Dave Bautista) or a Gamora (Zoe Saldana) spin-off film, I don't think it would work. Even Star-Lord. It's when they're together, and they are playing off of each other, that's when they are incredibly compelling.

This is one of the funniest movies of this year and I had a blast. The performances throughout the movie were great, with Chris Pratt showing a lot of emotion. The characters really surprised me, they are really well developed, every character is given a decent enough backstory to really care about them. The chemistry between the main leads was really stellar. The main villain in my opinion is not as good as other Marvel villains, as his motivation is very brushed off. I really liked how now Star-Lord is emotionally engaged with the story and he wasn't just forced into the story. The ending overall really did not surprise me except for one ballsy decision made to a character that I will not spoil, and that it made the ending more emotionally enriched. There is some problems with the script, as a previously stated the ending is somewhat clichéd and there is a lot of exposition throughout the movie, but the characters are really well developed and they are really likable. I also liked how they included more laughs in the movie and I was constantly laughing a lot throughout the movie. So the script is 50/50 for me. The direction was honestly great as the ways that the action sequences were directed were fantastic and really entertaining. The decisions made at the end really surprised me and I really like how this movie did not have unnecessary connections to Infinity War, like Avengers: Age of Ultron did. The green screen is awful, I would have preferred that they were more practical backgrounds as the green screen is really noticeable and it took me away of some of the scenes.

","The Guardians Of The Galaxy - Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Baby Groot (Vin Diesel) - are running for their lives from an alien race called The Sovereign, when they receive help from an unexpected source: Ego, The Living Planet, an ancient being who claims to be Peter's long-lost father...
The first Guardians Of The Galaxy's chief weapon was surprise. When the quirky quintet made their debut back in 2014, they represented Marvel Studios' biggest gamble to date. Sure, it was the company that had taken an Aussie surfer, given him a magic hammer and still created another hit to add to its roster of box office behemoths, but the received wisdom was that a sci-fi film featuring a talking raccoon, a sentient tree, an ex-wrestler, a green warrior woman, and a roguish bloke best known for being the tubby guy in Parks And Recreation would be a step too far.
Well, received wisdom can go hang. Driven by the indie, often delightfully deranged sensibilities of its director, James Gunn, Guardians was a joy, combining humour and sci-fi action in a manner that out-Star Warsed most Star Wars movies, danced a jig at the global box office, and became a fixture on many 'Best MCU films' lists. In short, we were Groot.
But when you've lost the element of surprise, following that is no easy task. Happy to report, though, bar a few last-act wobbles and the odd tonal shift, Gunn has done it again, crafting a sequel that keeps the focus on the characters we fell for first time around while pumping up the volume.
After the success of the first one - and perhaps learning from the travails of Joss Whedon who, by his own admission, had to endure a fair amount of interference and second-guessing on Avengers: Age Of Ultron - Marvel has handed Gunn the keys to the kingdom. And that confidence is evident from the film's credit sequence, which presents an action set-piece in a hilarious and highly unorthodox manner, while giving the incredibly cute Baby Groot a glorious moment in the spotlight and serving notice that 'Awesome Mix Vol. 2', the mix-tape that drives the film's soundtrack, is going to be every bit as earwormy as 'Vol. 1'.
And, for the terrific first hour or so that seems to be the case with the movie as well. If the first film was about bringing this group of A-holes together, then convention dictates that the sequel should be about forcing them apart. But Gunn is clearly uninterested in what he should do and so this is actually a film about the group realising that, despite their huge differences, they function best as the universe's most dysfunctional family. Yes, family - thematically this has a lot in common with Fast & Furious 8, with the F-word said so often it would overheat Dom Toretto's carburettor. Almost everyone here has daddy, mummy, or sister issues, with Quill in particular finding himself in a weird version of My Two Dads, torn between the dependably swaggering Russell's aptly-named Ego and Michael Rooker's gnarly space pirate, Yondu. But the emotions this engenders are unexpected and genuine. Beneath the film's sass - and there's plenty of that again - there's a real beating heart.
Vol. 2 is at its best when this motley crew are bickering and bantering amongst themselves (with Bautista's wonderfully unfiltered Drax getting the lion's share of the best lines again, including the T-shirt-worthy, ""I have famously huge turds"") and outside parties, this time including Ego, Pom Klementieff's sweet Mantis and Gamora's aggrieved sister, Nebula (Karen Gillan), given more to do this time around. Hanging out with them is so much fun that it's a shame when Gunn finally makes a concession to convention and remembers that films like this typically have to have a) a plot and b) a villain.
With the introduction of both, that's when the movie starts to falter. What was previously assured becomes a little abrasive and, at times, unappealing. Jokes that landed unerringly start to miss the target, including a running gag about a bad guy called Taserface that's not as funny as it may have seemed on paper/on set/in the edit, while one sequence which is meant to be a moment of triumphant heroism comes across as a tasteless misstep. And the final battle, try as it might, can't help but become a greenscreen jamboree.",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

","Writer/ Director James Gunn's ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" from 2014 (wow, that was fast) is not only the best entry in Marvel's box office-busting Cinematic Universe in my opinion; it's one of my favorite films of this decade full stop. Gunn's hand-made aesthetic and an ever-present love for his characters and source material (along with stunning technical merits, gorgeous effects and color palette, game cast, and perfect comedic timing) cemented ""Guardians"" as the pleasant surprise of the year and a bonafide critical smash. Expectations were justifiably sky high for a follow up, then in steps ""Vol.2."" Luckily Gunn and co. stick the landing with only some leg wobble. Yeah, much of the surprise is gone. We know these characters and we know the quirks. But the characters are still fun to be around and the quirks a joy to roll with in an MCU of near endless iterations and routines. Most satisfying, the ensemble of outcasts (our heroes) have evolved from the last outing. Rocket isn't just comedic relief. Baby Groot isn't overused. Drax is as giddy as a hyena. If Starlord isn't as charming or charismatic as the last time it's because his relationship with his father, Ego (Kurt Russell), is the dramatic center of the show. Gamora is underutilized but her subplot with her sister Nebula hit home. Most surprising is Yondu (Michael Rooker); who is given so much depth and emotional gravitas that he emerges as the most memorable aspect of the film... and maybe even the single best thing about this instalment.",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

898,10 December 2018,backslapjones,7," Good cgi
","Sure this movie has its flaws, but they are few and far between and they pale in comparison to the spectacular visuals alone. The landscape of Ego's planet is beautiful, same with the space battles and the makeup, and the fourth act has some of the most brilliant cgi in the mcu. I have to agree with Youtuber Jeremy Jahns that I was expecting a more complex core of Ego than a giant brain, but nevertheless it's an amazing treat for the eyes. The plot is creative and I think the story of Starlord's father was incredibly interesting, but those visuals made this movie a pretty damn good sequel. There was one thing in my opinion that kept it from being a great sequel, and that was the few instances of forced humor througout the movie. Examples I can remember are everyone laughing at the name Tazerface, the space fruit not being ripe, and the baby Groot schtick. I really don't know if the Tazerface thing was in the comics or not, but it just made me uncomfortable to watch all these characters bursting out laughing over something that warrants a chuckle at best. I know the MCU is family friendly and humor is the best way to ensure that, but the jokes need to be... jokes. They need to make the audience laugh, not the characters, and I just wasn't laughing at a number of these jokes. But this movie's visuals were so captivating I don't even really care about the cringey jokes, the images of reality-warping space jumps and fights with a cosmic superbeing eclipse them. Really cool soundtrack, too. The Chain by Fleetwood Mac was kind of the theme song, and it fit smoothly. Above all, this was a good sequel because it built on the original without mimicking the plot in any way, and that's all I really want in a sequel.",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

In 2014 Men's Journal listed the Senator among the top 20 movie theaters in the world. I had low expectations for this - not particularly a sci-fi fan, not particularly a comic book movie fan - I expected to be by far the oldest person in the theater - but it was a rainy day, and it was the film chosen to entertain a young family member, so off we went. First, I was surprised by the make up of the audience - lots of family groups, and lots of older viewers - I was not sitting in a sea of teens as I expected. This movie was simply put great entertainment. The characters were well fleshed out, the acting was stellar, and it was funny - laugh out loud funny. You have to love running jokes about David Hasselhoff, and I'm still wondering exactly how they pulled off the ""Benjamin Button"" reverse aging of Kurt Russell in the opening scene!

943,6 May 2017,LaLaLandSucks,7," It's an Okay Addition to the MCU
","This is quite an experimental film coming from Marvel. There are risks, but there are also safe spots. I thought a lot of the comedy hit for comedic reaction, but a lot of it screwed with the tone of the film and continuity of the Marvel universe. I don't think it's a bad thing to 2x the comedy up for Guardians of the Galaxy, but Gunn needs to know how to put them in the right spot so he doesn't create a chain of uneven continuity errors. There were parts near the end that should've been taken more seriously instead it was very insulting. There are a group of villains that are forced to be there that Gunn should've just shown for 2 minutes and move on with one main villain. They do end up having a purpose by the end, but they are just a plot device to be used for the next film. I feel like Marvel should've made the decision to make this a complete standalone instead of teasing for the next. The main villain is a bit better developed, but really too over the top and just completely silly. I like the character development throughout the film even though two of them did nothing. I feel the worst development out of all of them is Drax. They do keep some serious aspects of him, but he's quite uneven and becomes an almost different character. At times, he was so over the top that he ended up being comic relief throughout. Like, actually trying to be funny. The humor isn't bad, it's not completely cringeworthy like the other previous Marvel films, but it's just becomes a mess for the narrative. The visual effects are good, but there are several parts where the visual concepts just look bad. There is not much use of the 8K camera, but when there is, the dynamic range is incredible. Hopefully, Disney decides to adapt to a full length 8K Marvel film in the future. ",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

When the first one came out, I had no expectations as I hadn't heard of the Guardians of the Galaxy before, but the movie excelled as an action comedy with an amazing cast. However, that meant the bar was set high for this movie, and it somehow did even better than the first. The comedy was improved, the characters were further developed, and the villain was better. Though as soon as I heard the name ""Ego"" I knew he was the villain, as I'd seen 'Ego the Living Planet' in an old Fantastic Four cartoon, so the surprise twist that Quill's dad was the villain was expected by me, but was still executed well. A highlight would be Yondu's arc, which redeems his character and gives him a nice send-off.

","So Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was a brilliant entry to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Its 'staying to 80s' theme stayed lucky from the first film introducing another great album. Talking about the album, there were two ways I saw the album in the movie, 1. It wasn't better in song choose than Vol.1 but 2. Its song fit more and perfectly with the scenes it was placed with, especially 'Mr Blue Sky' in the opening titles. Also on the topic of the opening titles, Having close ups of baby Groot dancing whilst in the background the guardians try to kill the inter dimensional beast was a great idea and show'd a side of threat with what the guards had to face. One downside of this movie was that it had a recurring problem which happens in almost every other MARVEL movie and that its bad villains. Ayesha was a bit... nath and made no attempt in the movie to make actions her own. Taserface was a villain which well... died instantly and finally, Peters Dad... Ego Ego who was made out to be a good guy turned out to be a odd villain, another floating head villain which would make sense as his other side is a planet with a face in the comics but he's basically just a redone Dormarmmu.... which isn't good... Overall, the movie was brilliant, I think personally Yondu was my favourite character due to his personality change and I would give this movie an 8/10 for all these reasons",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

","GOTG vol. 2 certainly has a lot going for it and right from the opening sequence you can tell it's going to be fun. Overall I liked what the story wanted to be, but it just went a bit too much in the end. The heroes are great, funny, and well written. The bad-guy, long-lost-father is predictable and shallow. Toddler (not really a Baby) Groot is seriously cool and really lightens the mood throughout. The final battle sequence is visually striking, but way too convoluted and far-fetched even for a fantasy film. Sometimes all the Digital is just not physics relate-able.The best character development of the entire ride was Gamora and her sister Nebula. In a scene where they are genuinely trying to kill each other it is a believable feud. The story between Star Lord and his father Ego was bubble-gummy (playing catch in the backyard) and I saw his bad-guy turn very early on in the film. Why do writers have to have heroes always fall for the over-the-top promises of the villain? It reminded of me the Allegiant plot, where Woodley's Tris falls for all the mumbo-jumbo of the others once outside the city. I saw this in 3D at an advance press screening on 05/02/2017in an ATMOS theater. The 3D was pretty good, but a lot of the effects were muddled by all of the goings on in various battle, fight, destruction scenes, taking away from the overall effect and pulling me ""out"" of the movie at critical times.

I'm sure you'll agree that The Guardians of Galaxy is especially famous with its soundtracks. Music of 60's, 70's add some retro color to the movie. The film has a talented cast. I'm in favor of Chris Pratt's acting. Most of humor scenes belong to Drax that is the character of Dave Bautista. Also I was pleased to see charismatic Kurt Rassel. The plot isn't very complicated and new: our heroes try to save the universe again. Most of questions are answered in this film that remained unanswered in vol. 1. Some things were quite illogical and not convincing but in general I was satisfied at the end of the film. Represented topic of the relationship between father and son made a big impression on me.

I would say it is family friendly. The film itself is amazing the actors, the sets, the directors, the props, the writers, everything about it was on point from the first moment of the film. The soundtrack was also a clear favourite of mine as it created new emotions after finding out about Quinns real life and how he is the demi-god that he is. The only criticism I have to say about this film, is when Quinn loses his god-like abilities to save the galaxy. I thought by some miracle he would have them reinstated and he would once again be like a god among men. However, this did not happen and so it was a kind of anti-climax. Now he is just a basic astronaut, with cool weapons and aliens friends. Other than that it was amazing through and through.

","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is another unique and fresh addition to the MCU and like Vol.1, it's different to any other MCU movie. First of all I enjoyed the simplicity of the movie, because it didn't use the standard Disney Marvel how to make a movie structure. The use of Michael Rooker and Karen Gillian in Vol. 2 was a very good idea because it added more dynamic to Gamora and Peter Quill, which you will find out when you watch this movie. And you should see this movie because it's fun and throughout is hilarious. However my one suggestion to anyone wanting to go see this movie is to not sit in the very front row because there are a lot of jolts and fast paced action in this, so if you're looking up at the screen it can get quite confusing and trippy to watch.

Was a little too edgy, despite its cool-style action and 's***' sort of cursing. However,the characters in the film were kind of boring, despite one of the characters (Groot) kept repeating 'I am Groot' over and over. When he was saying it, it sounded a bit like he was actually saying 'I am Gru' as in the villain from Despicable Me. But despite that, I guess it was just part of the little creature's character. There was also another character who was kind of a female villain, she was completely gold but I don't know her name. Anyways, the opening sequence was quite good, there was this monster who wanted to kill them. But there's just something wrong with the ending sequence, the last shot of the film being one of the other characters, Rocket's tears running down his eye.

","The sequel to 2014's 'Guardians of the Galaxy' that surprised everyone who saw it, Marvel managed to assemble a team of heroes nobody had ever heard of and make an extremely entertaining and funny movie! The sequel is just like the first, with hilarious moments from all characters, fun action and a brilliant time at the cinema! This entry in the series is a lot funnier than the first as well, and possibly the funniest film in the 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' to date! The film does suffer from sequelitis, as it always would have, the sequel wasn't necessary as the plot was thin and it didn't need to have a whole movie made for it. It was just mainly a cash grab to bring the characters back together and to please the fans. As the first film was so surprising, there were high expectations for the sequel and I felt in terms of what it could've been, it didn't reach those expectations but Marvel still presented us with an action-packed comedy fest that delivered on all levels of 'fun'.

It was more interesting to me and Rocket and Yondu freaking MVPd both their humorous but also their heavily emotional scenes. The Drax-Mantis dynamic was also a great addition. As for the villain part of the story...well... I did not really care for the Sovereign Race sidestory and i wished that after their role as plot device was done and over we would not see them again but the post- movie scenes suggest otherwise. Pity. And Ego. I don't know. A typical megalomaniac who wants to destroy the universe just as many others before him.

1056,10 November 2017,fuzzymax-76787,9," As uniquely vibrant and quirky as the first, with even more heart, Guardians vol.2 is yet another entertaining addition to the MCU.
","Guardians of the Galaxy vol.2 is perhaps 2017's most underrated film. Most critics argue that the sequel lacked the freshness of the original film. However I disagree; whilst it isn't without its flaws, this installment of the Guardians franchise is still remarkably entertaining. James Gunn's flamboyant directorial style is outstanding, and while the script can't match it, Gunn has still crafted something unique and hilarious. The character development is one of the film's strengths, along with the perfect cast. Chris Pratt slips back into his role as Star Lord with ease, proving to be the most inspired casting choice in the superhero genre since Robert Downey JR as Iron Man. Zoe Saldana does OK once more as Gamora, but is outshone by Karen Gillian's Nebula, who's character has one of the film's best arcs. Bradley Cooper returns as Rocket, with pleasing development throughout the film, and Plom Klementieff proves a welcome addition to the ensemble as Mantis. Dave Bautstua's Drax is used perfectly in this film, hogging the humour and standing out among the core guardians, and Groot, now an Infant, is still loads of fun. Ego, a new character played by Kurt Russell, is a mixed bag, with his arc feeling uneven, but Russell's performance being solid; his character is integral to the film, as we quickly find out. Finally, Michael Rooker; Yondu, the heart of vol.2, with an extended role from the previous film. His portrayal is fantastic. Overall, Guardians vol.2 is thin on plot, but big on excitement, humour and heart, which makes it very watchable. Perhaps it isn't as good as the original, but it comes agonizingly close.",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

","Guardians of the Galaxy 2 is a not bad fantastic film of Marvel which is a sequel of Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). The film was directed by James Gunn, the shooting took five months. A little about the plot. It's set in the future. A main character (a son of an earthling and an alien), who's a part of a crazy team, finds his father (Ego) and together they go to an unusual world. Then the viewer finds out that Ego is a mad celestial and his plan is to capture the world. But Guardians stop his and save the Galaxy again. Now, characters. Peter Quill (the main character) is the captain of Guardians, he called himself Star Lord and he's the most charismatic member of the team. Gamora is a woman with green skin and perfect sword fighting skill. Drax is a good warrior and a brave alien. Rocket and Baby Groot are the smallest members of Guardians, but don't underestimate them. Also we can see Ego (an ancient crazy alien) and Yondu Udonta which educate Peter and replace him father; however, Quill understand it when Yondu sacrificed himself for the sake of Peter's salvation. Guardians of the Galaxy based on comics (as well as all films of Marvel Studio). I think, the producer made many fans happy. This movie has very vivid special effects and great film score. But personally I feel that I can't give 10 out of 10 to the film, despite all the advantages.

","I absolutely loved the first guardians movie. It is my personal favorite marvel movie and my second favorite superhero movie (with my favorite being the dark knight). So i was very excited for this movie. Did the movie disappoint? Oh, hell no! Could it be better? Yeah, a little bit. So let's talk about the things that i really liked. The acting in the movie is awesome, of course some of the old cast members are back and i love the cast. I think everyone is doing a really good job. And of course the guardians are extremely likable and none of the other characters are annoying. I'm not the biggest CGI fan, but as long as it looks good, it doesn't bother me. The effects and the cinematography were amazing. But you can expect that from a marvel movie. Also i really liked the story, at least most of it. The characters get so much more depth in this movie. That's good and not so good at the same time. I think the middle part of this movie drags on for a bit too long. I found myself being a little bored at the middle part. But my biggest dislike is that the movie doesn't really know what it's trying to be in like the first 30 minutes, and we as an audience don't really know what the plot is going to be. But overall i really loved this movie. It definitely lives up to the original and i'd love to watch it again. 9/10",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

","The Marvel universe isn't great for its sequels. After the fantastic 'Iron Man', we got the atrocious 'Iron Man 2', a film so forgettable I can't even remember what happens in it. After the Blockbuster Extravaganza 'Avengers Assemble', we got the seriously underwhelming 'Avengers: Age of Ultron', a film even the director was disappointed with. And finally, after the decent 'Thor', we got the unspeakable 'Thor: The Dark World' which I think is one of the most boring comic book movies in years. So yeah, the track record isn't great, but I was still excited for 'Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol 2'. I remembered really enjoying the first one, due to its likable characters, its kick-ass soundtrack, and really fun, well written story.

","Now that all of the characters are friends, I feel like the movie isn't as good as the first because there are no character bonding scenes other then Star Lord and Gamora. This movie is mostly about Star Lords farther and his story. Personally I think the original film's villain was better than the first. Baby Groot was a great decision from James Gunn, it's a cute thing that can make great merch. Yondu is much better in this film from the first, he questions why he is stealing, being mean and killing? The comedy has maintained great throughout both movies. In this movie there are two villains, the father and the gold people. The father is a great villain, Star Lord has a connection with him which makes it harder to kill him and the father is a truly sick man. BUT the gold people are one of the worst villains in a marvel film I've ever seen. Whenever there was a scene with them you really just wanted it to be over, there was a repetition of them always chasing them in their ships. Throughout the movie the soundtrack is amazing!

","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 starts with an absolutely laugh out hilarious opening credit scene with baby groot. It's great to see the team back together and having fun. Their banter and chemistry is still very strong. The comedy is even funnier than the first and is loaded with some big laughs. Primarily dished out by Drax, Mantis, Rocket, and Baby Groot. Baby Groot is used brilliantly in this story, and every second he's on screen are the best parts. The new addition to the team is Mantis, who is an outstanding side character to see interact with the team but mostly interact with Drax. Rocket and his CGI continue to be phenomenal, and he builds a new interesting relationship with Yondu. The heart from the first movie is present in this one, and the quality of the first soundtrack is duplicated in this as well. The two come together to softly complement one another near the end of the story. The film finds a good villain in Peter Quill's father Ego. He himself is a good character and villain even though his plan at the end is rather dumb, but there's still stakes. Gamora's behavior in this makes her a little unlikable. She spends most of the film just being angry, which makes her presence kind of unfun. Overall, this sequel is right on par with the first, and has a better villain and comedy than the first. Even though the first has better team chemistry and story. So I give it an 8.2",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

The story, which sees Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) unravel the question of his true parentage, goes heavy on themes of family and redemption.

","I loved the first one and couldn't wait to see this one because of it, but I wasn't as happy as I hoped to be. The main plot is really interesting, but it is shadowed by all the relationships possible between everyone. Quill-Dad(Ego),Quill-Gamora,Quill-Blue dad,Quill- Trash Panda. (Won't say the same relationships twice.)Gamora-her sister. Raccoon-crew, Raccoon-blue dude. Blue dude-his crew, blue dude-sylvester stallone and other dudes. It's just a lot of loving and being sad/happy and stuff. I guess it does make for an OK series on German television, but I didn't enjoy the whole destruction of the universe plot being in the background while they just discuss their feelings. The movie has some occasional jokes, that are a lot of fun. IMO Rocket Raccoon is the best part of the movie. It was actually fun to watch him. The visuals were really great, cool colours and stuff, and the music was, obviously, amazing. In conclusion, it felt like the movie was made for 8 year old's and their parents, and anyone else who might like the series was forgot about.

The sequel does not live up to those high standards set by the first film. The newest addition to the team, Mantis, seemed unusually shallow, and is supposed to be the love-interest of Drax. Honestly, I felt Baby Groot was overplayed for the one-liners, although he does provide a memorable scene in the midst of chaos: while perched on Rocket's shoulders: ""I am Groot!""; Rocket to Yondu: ""He says, 'welcome to the fricking Guardians of the Galaxy...

1158,12 March 2018,superdynamiteultraplatinumlee,10," Guardians of the Galaxy is beast!!!!
","Guardians of the Galaxies is one of the best movies ever I personally have every seen. It has many humorous, action-fixed, and emotional scenes. All of the characters in this movie have their own interesting personalities, which makes the production more appealing. 
 First off, the rating of this movie is PG-13, so it is mainly targeting the teenage group of people. My reaction from seeing first snapshot of the movie being released. I thought that this was going to be a nerdy science fiction movie. All I saw were these strange characters: a green alien woman, followed by blue one with glowing red hair, a raccoon, and a tree like figure. The extraterrestrial beings did not appeal to me: Gamora, Yondu, Drax, and Groot. Just to put this out there, I am not much of a movie watcher. I do not venture out to civilization that much. Without the strong encouragement from my friends, I probably would have stayed home and would have done nothing. Walking into the movie theatre, I thought that this movie was going to be so lame because prior to this experience I had not watched any Marvel Produced movies, so I had no idea how good this movie would be. On a side note, I now love Marvel because due to their wealth of success in recent years.
 The element of this movie that reached out to me the most were the songs because they are still really catchy and throw back like. On Spotify, I have added so many Guardians of the Galaxies sound track music to my playlist. Songs such as ""Hooked on a Feeling,"" ""Brandy, You are a Fine Girl,"" and ""Blue Sky"" are songs I listen to on a regular basis. In my opinion, the audience will definitely fall in love with these songs.
 Another cool aspect of this movie is the futuristic space portion. It showed us what it would be like if we lived on different planets and could travel between them using space ships. We see different type of other beings with different physical appearances than human beings. This movie features a possibility for the future if our technology can advance that far. 
 Personally, I think I have a huge sense of humor. There were so many hilarious scenes that attracted my attention. In those scenes, the characters use sarcasm something the audience is very accustomed to. From the bickering between Rocket and Peter Quill to Drax's very literal understanding, I had a great time enjoying the movie. 
 This movie covers three of the persuasive elements: ethos, logos, and pathos (mostly pathos). The heroes in the story do ethically the correct thing at the end by saving the universe, which makes them perceived as heroes. Many young adolescents look up to and admire heroes. The logical part of this movie is how the group of guardians figure out a way to defeat Ronan. Pathos is everywhere with the humor.
 Overall, I would give this movie a 10 stars out 10 for its awesomeness. 
To @moviecasualenthusiast and your lame review
Where can you even start? First off, your name is the movie casual enthusiast. So, why are you even criticizing this movie if you're an enthusiast. Don't put that as your username if you're not going to be enthusiastic for movie. Your username should be ""Comments that no one cares about."" Are you serious about a 10 year old child being capable of writing a multimillionaire production? You must come from a different planet if that is possible. I bet when you were 10 years old, you didn't even know how to write your name. If everything was so predictable, please tell me that you knew Yondu was going to die. You couldn't predict that. If you thought the acting was weak, then you're downgrading the whole Marvel organization. They would've picked the most qualified actors to fulfill their parts correctly. If there was only unintelligent humor, then that means you did not laugh at all watching the movie. Please tell me that you didn't laugh at all, so that I can expose you for being a robot and turn you into the government. The movie can't only have intelligent humor or else not everyone would understand the jokes such as yourself. If you are truly a big fan of Marvel, then you would accept that this movie was awesome. This just proves to show that you are not a true fan and a hater. Next time, just stay home and work on your elements of persuasion.",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017

","I really liked this film, but I wanted to really LOVE it. The only thing that prevented me from loving it was its fear of emotion. There were so many moments in this film that were high in emotion until they were struck down by unnecessary comedy. There were also some great emotional moments that weren't ruined, but there could have been so many more. Much of this unnecessary comedy came from Drax. It seemed to me that Drax wasn't the same character he was in the first film. In Vol. 1, Drax barely understood humor, while in Vol. 2, he is always either laughing obnoxiously or trying to make the audience laugh. It would seem that James Gunn knows how to create humor and knows how to create emotional moments, but he doesn't know when to keep them separate. I am assuming that Nicole Perlman was able to keep James Gunn in check while writing Vol. 1, but having full control of the script in Vol. 2 resulted in a tonally inconsistent film just a step away from great.",/review/rw3874528/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_2_2017
