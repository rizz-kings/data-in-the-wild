","This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",/review/rw9055087/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_3_2023

","It all leads back to where we once started off as all great trilogies have indicated from the past. But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel.

9,3 May 2023,cthirlby,10," Emotional and energetic!
","This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

11,5 May 2023,Chance_Boudreaux19,7," Much better than most of the recent Marvel projects but not as strong as the previous Guardians of the Galaxy instalments
","So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.",/review/rw9055087/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_3_2023

","I love Guardians of the Galaxy - a group of misfits who are wholesome, kind, imperfect and therefore wonderful. However this movie is going to give kids the same level of trauma that Never Ending Story, Dumbo, Watership Down, Bambi, etc etc gave Gen X. Absolutely brutal animal cruelty scenes (for some reason it's easier to cope with villains who only target humans) and it had me balling my eyes out at certain points (poor Rocket and his friends).

I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters.

19,4 May 2023,GusherPop,10," Each Hero has a story
","James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.",/review/rw9055087/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_3_2023

Don't get me wrong, it's not an earth-shattering masterpiece by any means, but its clever humor, endearing camaraderie between its quirky heroes, entertaining use of 80s music, and uniqueness compared to other Marvel films made it a breath of fresh air that many people really enjoyed. The second film was not as good as the first, but still enjoyable enough. Unfortunately, the third film is very disjointed and lacks any semblance of a compelling overarching story to really work.

But a lot of the film was unnecessary noise that added little to no value. The main villain and their motivation is poorly explained and illustrated. You needed to say more and explain 'why' he is doing what he's doing. We had a whole bunch of children randomly feature in the film and Gamora has returned after being killed off in the Avengers film but with little to no explanation as to how and why she's different.

More of a somber drama than the whimsical space-adventure of the previous two films, this third, and seemingly final, entry plays things very straight, telling an emotional story that may have you fighting back tears. Gunn has a clear care for both the source material and the story he's trying to tell, and it's evident; this is, without a doubt, a James Gunn movie through and through. The problem with that, for me, is that - and I mean this with the utmost respect - James Gunn is a fan of the bizarre and macabre, and I feel as if ""Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3"" was just a bit too bizarre and macabre for my taste.",/review/rw9055087/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_3_2023

Whenever the story flags, there's a fight scene of some sort. In its favour, the computer graphics are amazing, and there's a lot of imagination in the sets and backgrounds. But that's not enough to carry a movie, even a Marvel movie. As he did in Jurassic Park: Dominion, Chris Pratt looked embarrassed at times at the absurdity of his character and lines.

I am familiar with the origin of rocket raccoon in the comics, and although this was changed, it still made logical sense, and it was great to see his friend Lyla,in it, ditto, lots of other characters from the comics,(.. I chuckled when I spotted Howard, the duck in a scene,-I know his film was pilloried, but I remember I didn't think it was too bad in at all...), I was not sure about Will Poulter playing Adam warlock, but in the end I thought he did very well, as did everybody in this superb romp.

The first film was a breath of fresh air, the second was still fun if a little generic, but this one was a fitting climax to the trilogy, although at the end it did say ' star, Lord will return'....

","When it arrived nine years ago, James Gunn's GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY instantly became one the most popular films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The premise of a ragtag gang of super powered beings coming together and becoming reluctant heroes really struck a chord with comic fans and even those who were casual super hero film followers. The film had distinctive characters, and a lot of humor driven by the uniqueness of these heroes and their sharp edged personalities which were vividly rendered by some perfect casting choices. And a great soundtrack filled some of the best singles of the '70s was an added bonus. There had been some banger comic book films before GOTG, THE DARK KNIGHT and CAPTAIN AMERICA: WINTER SOLDIER being among the best, but GUARDIANS had a real sense of fun, and a lot of heart. I think this was mainly due to director and writer Gunn, who took a group of heroes that many die hard Marvel fans would have had a hard time placing in the comic universe and making them superstars. The follow up, subtitled Vol. 2, fell short of the bar set by the original, but it still had a lot going for it.

","The best MCU film since ""No Way Home"". This film was about everything I wanted it to be. It was very emotional and deep in a much different manner then I expected. I teared up more then once while watching this film. This is without a doubt the best looking MCU film in a while. The cinematography is amazing! The CGI/green screen is excellent! I didn't detect a single flaw with what they were able to achieve in that category. The action sequences were very well executed, especially one where all the Guardians are fighting together and it looks like it's all one take. The flashbacks involving Rocket's past were very difficult to watch. Very emotional and dark. What made it work really well was not the voice acting but how they made Rocket look and how they treated him. The stakes were never higher in any other Guardians movie but this, which made the intensity and emotions all pay mush well together. The humor worked very well, which can be hard for a film that is very emotional. James Gunn's direction and style made it all work. As for flaws, I found the villian weak as I couldn't connect with him whatsoever. I just didn't care about him and found him pretty useless. Will Poulter plays Adam Warlock and he's very good. It's just that the character is extremely underutilized. I thought there would be a lot of him in this film but there's actually not and they didn't really know what they were doing with him. There's also some plot holes where exposition was required in certain scenes, which is never a good thing. Besides that, this was a really good movie that I absolutely enjoyed from start to end. It's also very fast paced. This film moves and not a single scene drags. Is it the best Guardians movie? I don't think so but it's still up there and one of the better MCU films we've had as of late.",/review/rw9055087/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_3_2023

It was a mistake to emphasize the relationships between the characters because the vast majority of them have irrational expectations and behavior; It was another mistake to put Rocket's drama as a catalyst for the film because the villain depends precisely on his relationship with Rocket and that makes any sense of danger disappear. The villain is unfortunately the weakest in Marvel history and he really looks like a jester. If you expect entertainment you will find a couple of moments to laugh (thanks to Mantis) and some interesting visuals. The rest can be said to be pretentious, unbearable, tedious and generally leaves a very bitter taste in the mouth. I rarely yelled at the good guys in a movie theater, Die!!

","Of the three films, this one was the longest by far. I normally don't care how long a film is, as long as the story carries the runtime. But in this film's case, the story was dragged out with long and mostly unnecessary scenes. Much of the film was too much filler and not enough substance, and to make matters worse, most of that filler was overboard sappiness and cheesy dialogue with more misses than hits on the humor. It's like Gunn asked a bunch of fifth-graders to come up with the humor. That said, there were a few hits, but the infantile humor misses overshadowed the comedic moments that hit. Plus I felt the story wasn't as engaging as the first two instalments. Nevertheless, the S/VFX was outstanding, in abundance, and impressive, and the main reason for my generous 8/10, for a story and missed comedy that would've only deserved a 6/10.",/review/rw9055087/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_3_2023

","This is where the franchise has finally found its heart. And surprisingly the heart of the franchise is not the human character, but it's a raccoon.

They really went all out on the special effects budget for animating Rocket and his friends from his childhood, but it's clear that some of the other special effects are just big guys and rubber suits. It is a very good conclusion to the franchise, but I feel that it might not be the end because the movie was much more successful than other recent Marvel films. I think that Marvel, in Disney, need to learn that people are not going to go watch a movie just because of the character you also need a good story behind it, a good reason for it to exist. I think it's okay if a movie is not conventionally good as long as it is interesting, for example like Thor love and Thunder. It's a crazy movie. But the latest Ant-Man film it's not interesting it's not crazy, there's no reason for it to exist.

This is also Rocket Raccoon's origin story because it will go more of in depth of how he will learn how to talk and learn more from Rocket's creators. James Gunn did a great job on ending GOTG considering he will move onto DC. The acting by everyone was amazing that makes the viewer feels all type of emotions from laughter to sadness. The cinematography is visually stunning, from the CGI and special effects, that makes you feel that you were in another universe.

Remember when they broke out of the Kyln? Remember those victorious feelings. Well, you're gonna have to, because Marvel has lost the hero quality to it's movies. And this was perhaps Marvel's last hope. Of all their properties Guardians relied on a good story the most. But going back to Black Widow, the ability to tell an exciting and victorious Good vs. Evil story seems to have left the building.

Rocket became who he was because of the lord that made him as a reflection of his quest for a perfect universe. But like all despots that weild power things tend to backfire. The visuals and special effects are great at times though the action space was disorienting were they on a ship or some planet their home base. This one was an action drama to my view point then the previous 2 volumes. I did cry throgh parts of it there is no mercy for animal brutality.

","So given marvels recent few years of disappointments, endgame, Thor 4, Dr Strange 2 and Antman 3 I'm talking to you! I was as worried as most that the guardians final outing would possibly not live up to the greatness of volumes 1 & 2, especially given the delay with this last chapter due to Disney firing then rehiring James Gunn, proving once again how much of a mess they can make of things. However I am VERY happy to report, it's the BEST of the bunch! I don't really know where to start! It's got great action, the opening scene really kicks things off straight away! There's deep emotions on display particularly from Star Lord, but all get to show their fair share. And the comedy as usual is very funny and off the wall as with previous instalments. And finally as always yet again, the soundtrack rocks! James Gunn really has pulled out all the stops and gives the guardians the grand send off they all deserve. A word of warning tho to those wanting to show it to their young children, it does include marvels first f bomb, as well as some of the scenes are really quite dark which was surprising, but still great! Everyone in it gives great performances especially Adam warlock, although comic book fans may disagree with the direction of the character, I personally found him hilarious. The bad guy at times does border on the line of slightly of over acting occasionally but overall he's a good bad guy. It's bittersweet as it's the last guardians film but it is such a good final instalment, strongly confirming the guardians trilogy to be up there with some of the greats like the dark knight trilogy, Indiana jones, Star Wars etc. I've tried to keep this review as spoiler free as possible but fans of Firefly will love a few cameos! Anyway hopefully I've encouraged enough of you that you will have a good time watching this, if you don't, then watch it again just incase there's anything you may have missed! I'm very much hoping this gets released on bluray in 3D as it looks incredible in 3D also! I truly congratulate James Gunn on producing such a unique and brilliantly entertaining trilogy. It's going to be a long time until we get another trilogy that is this consistent with its quality and brilliance.

I wasn't sure if I wanted to go to the third movie but then my friend forced me to come with him, and it was SO MUCH FUN I wa in shock when Sylvester Stallone came out of nowhere. But the movie was so funny and say and the action was also good and I had so much fun. I cried a lot during the movie but that's what make movie a good movie doesn't it? In my opinion of course, most of the movies I liked the most are the movies that I cried the most. In my opinion, when the movies gets me into a emotional mood they're good, 'cause I think action and fights it is not all about the movie, there need to be emotions in the movie who will make the people who watching the movie feel something. I think if the movie is just action and fight it is a little big boring, and I'm fan of action movies but there is need to be things that. Will evoke emotions in the crowd who watching the movie.

","Most audiences are going to see this Thursday evening towards the weekend but as of the third installment of Guardians of the Galaxy, wish it was a unrated version so that they're could be more profanity and more severe violence.

But More than anything, this film reminds me how far the MCU has fallen. Do you remember how original the first Guardians felt? Nothing feels fresh or new about this.

","While recent Marvel movies have been falling flat mostly due to excessive cheesyness (Thor Love and Thunder and Ant Man Quantumania), Guardians of the Galaxy 3 delivers quality as their previous other 2. In a refreshing contrast to the other movies I mentioned, this one took on a more serious and even sad tone. Although it definitely fused in the comedic dialogue and antics, it was in a healthy moderation and the storyline (trying not to be too detailed as to spoil it) was deeper and deliberate with its unfolding process. The villains were portrayed in a way that was tied in nicely with the plot and were not necessarily pure evil but complex and given a fairly logical reasoning for their intentions. The soundtrack, as with the other two was pretty good. The visuals and casting were great as usual and they even went a little daring with the actor that played Adam Warlock but it surprisingly worked out.",/review/rw9055087/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_3_2023

It did have its moments for sure, but it all just felt so contrived. Also, the VFX were not good...on par with everything Marvel's been doing as of late...everything just looks so cartoonish, not a hint of practical effects or an attempt to try to anchor the cartoon to reality. I'm also just not really into Marvel's style of camp and its commitment to emulating (homaging?) 60s style sci-fi television.

It must have been difficult for the actors to overact in this way. The worst bit is the bad guy. Animal mutilation is not enough, no then we get the animal fast evolution machine and also the writer felt the need for cages filled with long haired smudged children in rags. I immediately got a memory jump back to Les Misérables. When the bady guy is confronted with the bad developments of ""his"" created world, he just pulls the plug. Detonates the planet (why and how) and leaves. In the end Gamorra pulls the guys face off like a rag. Although it is quite loose, he bleeds nonetheless. Question is why, why is this horror scene needed? The end of the movie is total cringe with a dance scene with a bad choice in music.

","It had some great moments. It started very strong and got me excited for the rest of the movie. Unfortunately I was let down. The positives of this movie kept me from going to the bathroom for the duration of its 2:30 run time. Rockets backstory was heartfelt and emotional. I really grew to love his character even more than I did. I didn't care much for Rocket before Endgame, but that movie helped to solidify his place in my heart as one of my favorites, and this movie only furthered that love for the character and I truly hope to see more of him. There was an amazing fight scene with interesting camera angles, cgi that didn't look like cgi on the big screen, and it made me go ""oooooh"" and laugh out loud a couple of times. Other than that this movie sucked. When it comes to group movies I always compare it to Ghostbusters. I know that's a high bar to hit but hear me out. Take into account the remake. Every character tried to be Bill Murray but failed horribly, and that's the problem with Marvel movies now. Every main character has to be the comic relief. They all have to have the same type of humor. Every single main character was trying to be funny and came off as dumb. They all got slimed and the theater was silent. Sure it is the best marvel movie of the year but that bar has dropped severely low recently. The last decent marvel movie was Black Panther 2. I wasn't a fan of the first one but I loved the 2nd and am very sad I missed it in theaters. I put it up against Endgame for quality. I dont expect Endgame quality everytime but atleast do all the hard work and years of build up justice. As a finale to the Guardians franchise, this was a disappointment. As a marvel movie, it hit the bar that's been set by the majority of the movies in the last few phases.

","After the many fiascos since Endgame (except for No way home), I really went into this film with zero expectation. But boy was I wrong. This movie has once more given me hope for the future of the MCU and has shown that the same hype and quality in cinematography that existed pre-Endgame can still be replicated if the project is lead by competent directors, writers and visual effect specialists. Watching the movie was truly a phenomenal emotional experience and gave me back my childly love for Comic book characters. I laughed, and I cried. I especially want to acknowledge the greatness of the fight coordinators and the visual effect specialists that worked on this movie, as their work has left me truly speechless and amazed. Even the camera movements alone is something to admire. The writers themselves have brilliantly given us a story arc for each character to be satisfied with. The perfectly timed humor and emotional scenes, which I believe is courtesy of the brilliant director James gunn, is something that all future directors of Marvel should learn from, especially if they want to keep up the quality in the franchise (looking at you, Thor love and thunder). I truly believe that if Marvel studios learn to let go of their unnecessary desire to push a political agenda, and makes sure to keep the quality of visual effect, writing and fight choreography high just like in this movie, there just might be a chance to revive people's love and hype for this franchise. One more time for the Marvel studios people in the back that didn't hear: MOVIES LIKE THIS IS WHAT WE WANT FOR THE MCU!!!",/review/rw9055087/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_3_2023

I saw that some people found the movie to just be a bunch of non-stop action, and criticizing it for lacking depth. But it feels like they have missed the point of the movie, it's a superhero movie. Not implying that all superhero movies lack depth, and according to me this one didn't, but in some way the focus is on action and excitement. James Gunn did more than that, the movie has an intriguing plot and is well written, many of the comic elements are actually funny and the cgi and the world that he has created are amazing.

","The previous Guardians movies have centred around charming but goofy captain Peter Quill but the creative team made a conscious choice to shift the focus to wise-cracking and temperamental Rocket Racoon. I really liked this choice, Rocket's backstory has a lot of substance and the flashbacks to how he was moulded into who he became were some of my favourite scenes in the movie. They could have been manipulative or saccharine but I found them heartbreaking and very well done. But aside from that, all the Guardians get something to do. Quill is grieving for his version of Gamora, Mantis is trying to get some respect from the rest of the group, Nebula is trying to deal with her babyface turn (her move to the lighter side of the character scale) and Drax is trying to help but is coming to terms with his spot in the team. This is a lot to juggle (more on that later) but it also helps they sculpt an appropriately savage villain for the Guardians to bounce off of in The High Evolutionary. Add in Adam Warlock (a hugely powerful but less than intelligent alien who has it out for the Guardians) and you've got quite an assembly.

And the movie is just not as good without her and her relationship with all the crew in general, and especially the very compelling relationship with Peter. It's bad enough to remove the two biggest stars from their biggest relationship roles in driving the franchise. They also take Rocket away from the crew for the vast majority of this movie as well. And he was the primary driver of so much of the rest of the relationships, not to mention the action and the fun. Mantis and Drax can't carry the whole movie any more than Nebula and, well, Nebula, as her character also suffers from the loss of her relationship with her sister Gamora. The Rocket backstory was interesting but it's not take up nearly half the movie with four brand new all CGI characters that pretty much only interact with each other interesting. The first act is mildly amusing and fun. The second act drags on forever. The only really good part is the final act when they are finally all back together in a way that vaguely resembles the action, fun, and spirit of the first two movies.

He works his magic of combining amazing acfion thrills, hilarious comedy and incredibly heart-wrenching drama. This is a very satisfying end to this version of the Guardians. It's not without fault though. Again, my common criticism is it's too long. There's also the issue of having 30+ movies and however many TV shows and specials as backstory/continuity. Gunn caters to those who aren't MCU devotees as best he can with a lot of exposition to fill in some gaps. For those of us who HAVE seen it all, these scenes can feel a little like a weight around the movie's neck. And finally, I'd say for little kids, the film is just too traumatic. The scenes of animal cruelty could be very upsetting so take heed if you have sensitive little ones. But overall, a triumph. Better than Vol.2 if not quite in the same league as Vol.1. If Gunn can temper his instincts to always go for the laugh (which he over-uses here), then Superman Legacy should be something very special.",/review/rw9055087/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_3_2023

","I really liked this movie, it has lots of great points, but from the get-go there was way too much screaming of lines. There's always been a lot of banter in Guardians movies, but it's never always been screamed before. I felt everyone was constantly angry, and it kind of ruined the rappore between the characters a little. That aside though, it's a solid movie and a great addition to the trilogy. Adam Warlock's character was a good balance between bad-ass and a bit goofy, and the main bad guy did a great job of being 'unhinged' and scary. I think this could have been a solid 10/10 if they'd paid a little more attention to maintaining the character's individual demenors instead of throwing them off-balance. As it stands though, it's a good 8/10.",/review/rw9055087/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_3_2023

After being attacked on their home base by one Adam Warlock, Will Poulter, Rocket Raccoon finds himself mortally hurt which prompts the rest of his comrades to find a means of getting him healed (when they discover his DNA has a lock on it which if tampered with can kill him). Primarily using Rocket's backstory to tell our main narrative, we learn the evil machinations of the High Evolutionary, played by Chudwudi Iwuji, who succeeded (if success is a barometer when an animal is given humanistic traits!) w/Rocket where his other creations haven't quite landed. Throughout a series of increasing bizarre adventures on different locations, the audience is in constant state of having lumps in their throats not knowing if one of their faves will bite the dust but Gunn is shrewd enough to know which buttons to press making this an immensely satisfying time at the cinema checking off all the relevant boxes.",/review/rw9055087/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_3_2023

The use of sound and camera angles took this movie to another level! The fight scene in the corridor was epic!!! Next, Chris Pratt. He delivered one of the most heartbreaking moments when Peter thought Rocket was dead. You could feel the pain. It shook me to the core because it was some of the best acting I've seen in any movie in a long time. Then there's Nebula. Her arc was been so incredible to watch. From an enemy and cold blooded killer to a friend, mother figure, leader, emotionally open person.... It was another artful example of James Gunn. Drax, the Father! All I will say. Lastly.... Rocket. Of all the characters in the MCU I never knew HE would be the one I'd love beyond measure. His backstory will tear you down the core of your soul. I am literally tearing up now just thinking about it. The word ""Hurts"" will become a trigger word for the rest of my life. Rocket ""the Raccoon"" has become the true symbol of Marvel.

","Gotg 3 provides an satisfying conclusion to the journey that began in 2014 and took us into a epic ride of universe with colorful adventure and characters with heart ❤.. I think entire trilogy is perfect filled with emotions and drama with some fun action and amazing humour.. It will be right to say that this film is about Rocket Racoon in same way last one was about Peter Quill and first one was about Gamora. I never thought I would love this misfits this much a very very big thanks to James Gunn for making these characters so relatable that we actually feel what is happening to them in this universe.. I won't lie I cried many times throughout the movie because how beautiful this is.. It also has some amazing humour and jokes which lightens up our mood after any heavy moment.. Action is amazing as last 2 films, it has some really good jokes and comedy and a sense of end with these character's journey which was really beautiful.. Rocket Racoon and Nebula got most of the character development throughout this trilogy and the way they end Drax's story made me really cry.. There are some cute animals too like every other Gunn movie whoam you'll love, Will Poulter was also good as Adam Warlock and he has a long road ahead of him in MCU..Chukwudi Iwuji played main villain High Evolutionaty here and he will become one of the most hated villains in entire MCU I'm sure he has his own sense of twisted morality which'll give you hard time to watch just wished they ended him in some another way instead of any other average MCU villain but anyway he is great in his performance, rest of cast is also great in their role especially Zoe Saldana as Gamora.. GOTG trilogy is not just some space action adventure comedy but also an heartfelt drama which teaches us about importance of friends, family and life itself... I never thought I would love these misfit bands of Superhero so much that it'll make me cry...

","The movie was already epic way before it was over and by the time it ended it was the best MCU movie yet. Can't gush over this one enough. The fights were some of the best choreographed in Marvel ever, or at least in a long while. The cherry on top was the writing. The story was heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time, which made for a good mix of emotions mixed with the humor, which I'd say was both funny and well-timed. And the characters were written very well, each one behaving how we've come to know them while also still growing. I think this is one of the best movies in the MCU so far. This is primarily because the movie only relies on the first 2 movies and not the tiring MCU continuity that nobody wants to see anymore.

","What a disappointment! The first one was great fun, the second almost as good , but this film is just a poor cousin that really struggles from a weak storyline that never really gets going. The megalomaniacal ""High Evolutionary"" (Chikwudi Iwuji) has set his sights on retrieving ""Rocket"" after having discovered that our feisty raccoon is a product of sophisticated genetic engineering - and that has enabled him to think and grow as a being; a skill that is hugely valuable to this global-scale cloner. Snag is, ""Rocket"" has been laid low after a rather violent visit from ""Warlock"" (Will Poulter) who is working with his mother to apprehend our ursine pal. ""Quill"" (Chris Pratt) and the others have determined to save him, though, and are soon on the trail of his origins and of a special pass key that could reset him and get him back to fighting fitness. Can the ""Guardians"" put aside their petty differences and unite before it's all too late? This is far too long and it also tries to involve all of the characters in such a fashion as to leave the whole thing with a rather superficial feel to it. Pratt actually features quite sparingly, and that robbed this of much of it's humour and punchiness. The visual effects are great, but that's nothing remarkable with Marvel - they are vivid and colourful but that's no substitute for a well written and characterful narrative that this film simply lacks. It does quite feature quite an engagingly eclectic soundtrack, but the rest of this is terribly unremarkable fayre that I found my self struggling to stay interested in as it meandered more into a realm of sci-fi sentimentality that ensured a minimum of jeopardy in a denouement that featured a fair degree of ham - especially from Iwuji.

","This film was something..definitely something. Something amazing to say the least. And that's an understatement. This film jerked every emotion you have, and had you wanting more. This film focused a lot more on Rocket the Racoon and his backstory, and a great part of the film atleast till a little past the middle, was about rocket and the guardians trying to save him after a run in with Adam Warlock in the beginning. Marvel had went downhill with their films recently, quality wise, and story wise. Seeming to put quantity over quality. But they definitely saved themselves with this. This film is everything a comic book film should be, with intense action sequences and heartbreaking scenes mixed in with comedy, along with sad scenes like almost all of Rockets, that will make you leave the theater teary eyed. The way they did this film is just spectacular. From the opening it has you hooked. One thing i did not like though, is i feel they could of done more with Gamora and Quill, as i feel they didn't have as much screen time together in the film as they should. But that's just me. They DID ""change"" as the movie progresses though, starting with Gamora hating Quill, even pushing him against a wall in his ship. To them fighting along side each other in what i and most of the marvel community would say is one of the best fight scenes in cinematic history..well atleast marvel history. (the hallway fight scene). All the way to having a heart wrenching talk in the end, where Peter accepts that Gamora will never feel the same about him like he still does, and how they did in the last (previous) films. Anyways enough with the spoilers. All together this film was thoroughly very enjoyable and had me wanting to see what happens next when i left the theater.

Each member of the team gets their moment to show just how important they are to the others. The High Evolutionary delivers as a very hate-able villain.

This film dives deep into rockets backstory filling in the holes as we don't know much about him yet other than that he's a very smart raccoon, who can talk. With throwbacks to infinity war and endgame we now see how much of a family the GotG are and what lengths they'll go for one another.

","So disappointing. I was really looking forward to seeing Guardians. It has been a long time since enjoying movies in a theatre. Even though I did not love Vol.2, I was excited to see Vol. 3. Right from the start, there is this dismal sense of pall. Before any of the Rocket backstory, he is already behaving very melancholy. Then an intense sense of dread as you see the cage full of racoon babies. And it never lets up. I did not find it sad, more like disturbing. I felt like I was repeatedly assaulted. It is like the unrelenting ASPCA commercials that we are subjected to on television. Animal cruelty is a serious problem and not something that I expected to see treated in this film. I did want so badly to walk out of the theater. I keep thinking it will get better. Even the music was awful. It added nothing to the scenes and instead I found myself grateful the song was over. There was nothing appealing about Peter Quill and I wondered how much is that to do with my growing dislike of Chris Pratt. About the only scene that I did truly love was when Drax and Mantis are trying to get inside the lab and she convinces the bouncer that he is infatuated with Drax. I never realized that Dave Bautista could act or that Drax could be so appealing. I did enjoy the scene with Quill and Groot in the control room with the High whatever. That is about the most exciting scene in the film. Nebula I am not sure what to make of and not sure she fits in with the Guardians. Is she in love with Quill? That was a very weird turn. Gamora is not even Gamora. She was wasted in this film. I remember thinking that when Quill was exposed in space that maybe it will remind Gamora, but this Gamora never knew he sacrificed himself in Vol.1 for her. He was so Heroic :) -- a reminder of when Guardians was charming. Kraglin is useless without Yondu and could it be more obvious that he will master the whistle trick before the end. The whole ""bad dog"" gag was irritating. Nathan Fillion only served to remind me how we were robbed of Malcolm Reynolds and Firefly. And who would want to live in Knowhere? A more dismal place you cannot find. No wonder everyone wants to leave at the end. A very dismal end to my Marvel courtship.

I barely remembered how a good marvel movie was, but after watching this, I again have hope once again. The villain is also the best the team has ever had, its menacing and you hate him from the very first moment he appears, and if you ever had a pet, hes gonna break your heart into pieces. But there are little tiny things I didnt like, for once, I think it was just a little too long, there were times when I just felt like it was too much time for some scenes and stuff, then I think that this is the movie of the guardians with the least best jokes, having some weird moments where I didnt laugh, but they were just some times and my last complain is that at points they forget a little about other characters, everyone has their moments to shine and its amount of screentime making jokes but besides those few instances, they dont do much else.

In the process they saved a lot of scientifically enhanced children and a bunch of animals from earth. Scenes about Rocket's past were heartbreaking but in the end it had a happy ending.

The story is mostly about rocket and his abuse before he joined them. Everyone gets to talk about their feelings. A random need to find grandpa pops up for star lord. Still lots of action adventure as they fight their way through the raccoons abusers ship to get a code to help him survive a chest wound after said abusers wanted him back to learn how to make more. Sadly strange and creepy storyline. A few funny moments for comic relief. I see a possible spin off for Mantis as she had a bigger part this time around and seems to be the only one that hasn't done an interview saying goodbye and they will be happy to move on ( at least not that I've read). Things tied up ok in the end for the guardians but was basically anticlimactic.

Toward the end of the movie, I realized I was feeling jostled around with ups and downs, visually and emotionally, similar to the ride at Disneyland. This is a great thing! It is solidly entertaining and visually stunning. The violence in it was triggering for me personally. If you are an animal lover or are triggered by aspca commercials, you'll find discomfort here. I'm a wimp but I do appreciate the message it was sending. It has people angry about the horrors treating animals poorly and that's important.

Like Peter Quill not being able to get on knowhere on time and freezing just so that Adam Warlock can have his totally ""epic"" redemption arch! But if he was such an important character, why did you give him a brilliant introduction at the start and proceed to sideline him the rest of the entire movie. Let's not mention how the part where Quill and Groot entered the flying thingy was suped rushed, Quill is arrogant and hotheaded but he would never face someone like that, that part was included so that Quill and Groot could have an epic action scene (this one is serious) and also to trap Drax, Mantis and Nebula there. Let's not mention past Gamora developing feelings for Quill out ot nowhere when they were arguing for like 1/2 of the movie. The last thing i had an issue with was the villian, he wasn't that badly potrayed but the way he went out was just so bad, he literally got ambushed by the other guardians (lets not mention how cliche that is) and got finished in like 1 minute without offering much of a threat. But i must admit that the action was done well, the emotional scenes were decent and the comedy was still decent, watch it but dont expect too much from it.

I guess I need to go back but another thing was all the swearing. I don't remember any swearing in the 1st 2 but it was predominate in 3. Also on of the more subtle things with the franchise was the sound track. They seemed to move away from that and why he had the recordings at all. I think like a lot of these kind of movies they rely on the CGI too much which this one did. The bad thing for me who was a big fan of the franchise I will not miss the fact that they will not be making #4 which is the rumor.

","The third installment of the adventures of Star Lord and company offers an extraordinary experience of pure entertainment full of action, emotion, laughter and tears. Once again the spectacular Chris Pratt, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper meet for one last adventure and what is possibly the farewell of this beloved group. A story that centers on a race against time to save Rocket, who has been quite flashy since the first movie and here he gets more in-depth. Through his memories we learn of his tragic origin story that offers poignant and sad moments. Humor is never lacking to alleviate emotional, tense and sad moments. Unlike the previous films, this one comes to have a deep and complex plot. Rocket's origins become a kind of allegory for animal abuse, and even though I'm someone who doesn't care about animals and doesn't believe in their rights either, I must admit that the story about Rocket's past is so well elaborated, that touches and can make the viewer cry. The next point regarding Rocket's origin connects well with the antagonist's motivations, since his reasons, plans, and vision are somewhat reminiscent of The Island Of Doctor Moreau. This is perhaps one of the best installments of the MCU for the depth of its context. As always with these movies, the production is really promising, with a lot going for it.

A movie that have still great special effects, visuals, interesting fights sequences mostly the end with the shot without any cut that really was impressive. I liked also the humor: sometimes too much, but sometimes pretty funny. The new vilain is good but kind of cliché and dont really stand out by his intention and was more useful trough him to know more Rocket.

","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is without a doubt the darkest Marvel movie to date. Rocket is the central piece of the story, and his traumatic past is revealed with the help of flashbacks. I was very surprised that some scenes were so dark, disturbing, tragic and violent. Prepare for tears. It is a very serious film, with some comedic elements. Not as funny as its predecessors, but still quite funny, I laughed several times. But this is also what is the big difference compared to previous Guardians movies. I usually like dark stories, and it was a good dark story, but this one felt a little out of place. After seeing the rating for the movie, I thought this would be the funniest movie yet, not the darkest. I wasn't prepared for that.

Sure, you get your typical punch lines, jokes, and weird subplots, but the story has a terrific driving force. Without giving away details, the story helped me understand many problems in our society, and also why a good narrative needs one strong message to make people relate to it. The dialogue, the scenarios, even the characters only serve this purpose, they do not stand alone as much as they have their own ""lives"" in that universe... And Marvel certainly didn't want to just push this message, but it bought the idea and created a masterpiece out of a blockbuster: not in terms of cinematography or acting, but in terms of narrative and film experience.

672,8 May 2023,EdwardtheBlackPrince,7," We're the Guardians of the Galaxy
","In James Gunn's final farewell from Marvel, we have Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. The Guardians now in possession of Knowhere are in the process of rebuilding the Colney following Thanos's attack. Quill's still mourning the loss of Gamora and failing to impress the variety picked up in Endgame. Matters only get worse when all of a sudden Adam Warlock(Will Poulter) shows up to destroy the guardian and in the process, Rocket is mortally wounded and is put on Life support. So now the Guardians have to set out and the means to save him all wrapped in the possession of the mysterious High Evolutionary. In many ways, Guardians 3 set out what it tends to do in what's meant to be a farewell to not only the director but also these characters that we've gotten to know over several films. While there's still humor and charm to be found in this film It stands out from past several films going for a more serious tone. The first half of the film is far slower paced it's more dialogue-driven as imposes actions and in many ways, it works, and in many ways, it doesn't. With subplots that don't overall mean much to moments that do feel like bloat that just expands the film's runtime. This is understandable given they wanted everybody to get their fair amount of screen time, but some moments could have been trimmed down in favor of giving more focus to other things such as Starlord and Gamora. Overall the theme of family, loss, and moving on emotional investment in the relation of the team. The cast as a whole for the most part a great all the guardians are delivered well the humor is rather mixed in this film when it does happen not every joke don't hits as in previous films. Most of the funny lines are Delivered by Drax. Whereas many from Mantis just come off as forced. Groot is Groot he's fine, but the design they give him just looks terrible compared to how he looks in the first. Star lord they set up a subplot with him, but their address in small moments then never addressed again. Him being a Celestial his blunder with Thanos in the first half he just acts like a jerk and halfway through he;'s more the character we knew in the other films. As for the relationship between him and Gamora with little she has to do with the Story Zoe Saldana does give a great delivery, but when it comes to the overall situation between her and Quill. Rocket, of course, is the center point of the story the drive to push all of them to show their love and admiration for each other as sort of the defauctonional family they are. Most of his scenes are done through flashbacks and overall I enjoyed them. Rocket was always the member we knew the least about and had just hinted to go off. It's here that finally shows the answers and where the more serious aspect of the film derives from. It's darker, depressing, and violent. The High Evolutionary sells all of these points. It was quite shocking that they were able to make this villain work the way they did. He's a welcome addition to what's been missing past Endgame. He's a villain a Fanatic geneticist who's obsessed with making the perfect lifeform. Doesn't care about any of his creations, or any of the despicable actions he commits. He's not misunderstood, he wasn't wronged in his past He was just psycho with a God Complex, and the movie does well in making you hate him. The worst aspect starts with Adam Warlock. It's been stated numerous times that it's too late to bring this character into these films. Set up at the end of the second film and did nothing with him for infinity war and Endgame where everybody stated he should have been with Thanos. Now we're finally giving him in the film and he sucks. He's reduced to nothing more than a puppet and is a dumb mama's boy who connects to overall nothing in the grand scheme of things. The second is the soundtrack. The soundtrack in these films has always been some of the best highlights. Whereas a lot of films rely on Licensed songs just for cheap grabs. The songs in guardians' films always fit setting the tone and pace of the action. They all for the most part fitted with the scenes they were assigned to. Here personally I don't remember a single song from this. It just felt like Gunn was just going all out same with the camera shots and spins. The songs are just thrown in everywhere just for the sake of noise. Overall while the film does feel bloated and some things don't add up the movie does serve as a sent-off to these character ad a good farewell.",/review/rw9055087/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_3_2023

It definitely achieved the goal. This movie jumps right into the story and sucks you in, we return to the galaxy and immediately it starts to pull on your heartstrings, and then the action begins. The performances are all fantastic as they always were, maybe even Chris Pratt's best performance of his career. The chemistry with the team is the most natural it has been. The negative is something I personally always did not care for with Gunn is sometimes the humor timing is off and the jokes aren't always as strong. There are times throughout the movie where a joke comes in and they nail it and there are quite a few times where it does ruin moments and also the joke is a bit cringe and it does not stop it keeps going on in the scene.

703,18 May 2023,Horst_In_Translation,6," Another spectacular entry to the series, story is alright as usual
","Okay, here we have the newest installment to the Marvel franchise and the official title is ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"". I guess I will just talk a bit about the basics here and then move on in brainstorming fashion to some of the aspect of the plot of this movie. With the Avengers films over, of course we are getting closer to the end of the entire franchise, but a few more films are surely going to happen. This one here could be the one that is going to end the Guardians of the Galaxy sub-franchise then and it felt a bit strange to finally have a movie from the Avengers universe that does not have Dr. Strange in it. He has been everywhere literally before that. But yeah, this one runs for almost exactly 2.5 hours and this is the expected running time for a film like this I would say and overall I would also not have kept it much shorter. The scenes made sense. The one who wrote all those and is also once again the director is of course James Gunn. He has been part of the GotG films since the very beginning in both positions, so no surprise he is back here as well. I mean there was even a short holiday special last year I think and Gunn was on board there too, so no way he would miss out here. I am still curious about what he is going to work on when/if the GotG films really have their closure. Now? As for the cast, you will be getting all the familiar faces and voices again from the previous movies. I will not mention all the names now, but the one leading the gang is of course once more Chris Pratt's character and Pom Klementieff is also growing on me more and more. Interesting actress and with her I am also curious what she is going to work on next. Really nice to get a relatively unknown actress for such a key role, even if she had not been in it from the start. I also loved her little Fantasy Football endeavor song in-between.",/review/rw9055087/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_3_2023

GOTG 3 is definitely going to feel more like an origin story for Rocket and it's one of the best origin stories, it's full of laughs like Marvel has been known for but it's also going to get dark and it's probably one of the more violent MCU movies short of Deadpool. I'm not usually an emotional guy but this movie had me wearing my heart on my sleeve not only for Rocket but there are plenty of other emotional moments involving other characters that will tug at your emotions.

","An emotional, heartfelt and touching way to end the James Gunn trilogy when it comes to the 'Guardians of the Galaxy.' The much anticipated third installment leaves fans with a greater understanding of Rockets story, the true meaning of being a Guardian, and where this leaves our group moving forward. A film filled with the same comedic moments that we all grew to love while also pulling our heartstrings and really making us uncomfortable when it comes to The High Evolutionary' and his new world. This film does a great job at introducing us to our villain played by Chukwudi Iwuji, and it doesn't take long for the hate to grow from the viewer. What this man does to different species is unimaginable and is really hard to watch at times. Thankfully we have our faithful heroes played by returning cast members Chris Pratt, Bradley Cooper, Karen Gillan, Dave Bautista, Pom Klementieff, and Vin Diesel. We also are introduced to a slew of new characters that will greatly impact where the Guardians are heading moving forward. While this isn't the end of the Guardians, this is the end of the James Gunn trilogy as he moves to DC to focus on rebuilding their comic cinematic universe. I think we all need to applaud the work that Gunn has done for the Guardians trilogy as he brought it with every film and did an impeccable job connecting the audience with these characters and allowing us to grow with them.

I did enjoy Dave Bautista and Will Poulter was an unusual addition and Groot is always a fun character. I have no idea what this was about. These things are always about the good guys trying to defeat evil beings and and/or empires. There's nothing offensive about this, though I was disappointed in the special effects.

","The original Guardians movie was fantastic fun, the second movie had great moments, and members of the group popped up in other movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this third movie is essentially concluding the self-contained trilogy, written and directed by James Gunn (Slither, Super). Basically, the Guardians of the Galaxy: Peter Quill aka Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Drax (Dave Bautista), Nebula (Karen Gillan), Mantis (Pom Klementieff), Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Groot (Vin Diesel) have established their new headquarters on the rebuilt Knowhere. During the night, they are attacked by Adam Warlock (Will Poulter), a Sovereign warrior created by their high priestess Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki). Rocket is critically wounded during the attack; Adam overpowers them but is forced to flee after being stabbed by Nebula. The Guardians are unable to heal Rocket's wounds due to a kill switch, implanted into him by the company Orgocorp. They travel to Orgocorp's headquarters to find the override code. While Rocket is unconscious, he recalls his past, shown in flashbacks. As a baby raccoon, he was experimented on by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji), a mad scientist who sought to enhance and anthropomorphise animal lifeforms to create a Counter-Earth. Rocket formed friendships with the High Evolutionary's other test subjects: the otter Lylla (Linda Cardellini), the walrus Teefs (Asim Chaudhry), and the rabbit Floor (Mikaela Hoover). The High Evolutionary was impressed by Rocket's developing intellect but became furious once it had exceeded his own. Rocket helped the High Evolutionary to perfect his experiments but ordered Rocket's brain to be extracted and his friends incinerated. Rocket freed Lylla, only for the High Evolutionary to kill her. Rocket mauled the High Evolutionary and shot his guards, but Teefs and Floor were killed in the crossfire. Alone, Rocket stole a spaceship and escaped. In the present, the alternate version of Gamora (Zoe Saldana), who has joined the Ravagers, helps the Guardians infiltrate Orgocorp. They retrieve Rocket's file but discover that the code has been removed. The group speculates that Theel (Nico Santos), one of the High Evolutionary's advisors, has it, so they depart for Counter-Earth. They are followed by Ayesha and Adam, who are ordered by their creator, the High Evolutionary, to retrieve Rocket for his brain. Upon arriving, they are greeted by an array of anthropomorphic animal residents, they are initially startled by them but help the team to find Theel and the High Evolutionary's ship. Drax and Mantis stay with Gamora and Rocket while Peter Quill, Groot, and Nebula travel to the High Evolutionary's ship. Nebula is forced to wait outside by guards as Quill and Groot board. Drax and Mantis pursue Quill's group. The High Evolutionary initiates his destruction and planned recreation of Counter-Earth, which kills all life on the planet, including Ayesha. As his ship enters orbit, Quill and Groot leap off and kill Theel, retrieving the code from him. Gamora arrives with their ship to rescue them, while Nebula, Mantis, and Drax board the High Evolutionary's ship to escape the planet. As Quill's group attempts to use the code, Rocket flatlines and has a near-death experience, where he reunites with Lylla, Teefs, and Floor in the afterlife. Lylla tells him that it is not his time yet as Quill uses the code to disable the kill switch and save Rocket's life. Nebula, Mantis, and Drax come across hundreds of imprisoned humanoid children on the High Evolutionary's ship before being captured. Quill's group sets out to rescue the trio, who are placed in a chamber with monstrous Abilisks. Mantis befriends the Abilisks, allowing the group to escape and reunite with Quill's group, together overpowering the High Evolutionary's army. Kraglin (Sean Gunn, James's brother) and Cosmo (Maria Bakalova) arrive on Knowhere, and the captured children are freed through a telekinetic tunnel created by Cosmo connecting the High Evolutionary's ship to the planet. Rocket discovers imprisoned animals on the ship before being attacked by the High Evolutionary. But the rest of the Guardians arrive to help defeat him, leaving him to perish on his ship. The animals are released by the Guardians and lead them aboard Knowhere. Quill nearly dies trying to cross over but is saved by Adam, who had a change of heart after being saved by Groot. In the aftermath, Quill leaves the Guardians, passing the roll of captain onto Rocket before leaving for Earth to reunite with his grandfather Jason (Gregg Henry). Mantis embarks on a journey of self-discovery with the Abilisks, Gamora reunites with the Ravagers, and Nebula and Drax remain on Knowhere to raise the rescued children. The new Guardians, consisting of Rocket, Groot, Cosmo, Kraglin, Adam, rescued child Phyla (Kai Zen), and Adam's pet Blurp (Dee Bradley Baker), take on a new mission. Also starring Nathan Fillion as Master Karja, Sylvester Stallone as Stakar Ogord, Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex, Christopher Fairbank as the Broker, Karen Abercrombie as Grandma Quill, Michael Rooker as Yondu Udonta, Judy Greer as the voice of War Pig, and Tara Strong as the voice of Mainframe. Pratt, Bautista, Gillan and the rest of the gang all get their moments, Cooper obviously stands out with his beloved character's origins story, Cardellini makes an impression as a kind-hearted talking otter, Iwuji is reasonable as the obsessive villain, and Poulter and Debicki are alright as well. The movie is the usual mix of heroes and villains battling each other, high-speed fights and chases, brilliant CGI special effects, and amusing moments, but it also has its darker, melancholic moments as Rocket becomes the central character and it has his backstory being experimented on along with other animals, this is most interesting. As before the soundtrack of ""awesome"" songs adds to the fun (including ""Creep"" by Radiohead, ""Since You Been Gone"" by Rainbow, ""No Sleep Till Brooklyn"" by Beastie Boys, and ""Dog Days Are Over"" by Florence + the Machine), it looks like this is indeed the conclusion to this trilogy, but the characters can always come back elsewhere in the Marvel series, this is a terrific superhero science-fiction action adventure.

The magic that we enjoyed with Starlord and Gamora was replaced with tension and disdain.

The villain was awesome, but there were many support characters that seemed to be written in when convenient, and confusing story arcs did not blend well. The main focus, Rocket, was interesting and also a little tragic. However, by not having him involved in the actual mission further took away from the chemistry.

Adam Warlock wasn't necessarily a true villain, however it helped us understand the high evolutionary and his place in the galaxy. The song choices in this film were absolutely perfect with songs expanding further than the 80s like in previous films. Many questions from End Game were answered such as what happened to Gamora? And where did the guardians end up? This movie allows us to see different sides of every one of the characters we've seen before and though it especially tackles Rocket, we're able to get an insight into who the Guardians are as individuals rather than who they are in the team which is very fitting considering the movies themes.

","Wow, I just came back from watching this movie and let me tell you...I have never cried this hard over a movie that heavily revolves around CGI characters. Rocket's origin story will tug at your heartstrings and give you a newfound appreciation for him by explaining his isolated and angry personality. His animal friends, which are only just introduced in this movie, somehow got so much personality and kinship that you will find yourself completely attached to them (thus more emotions once the inevitable happens). Not only that, but each and every character from the group has their own heart wrenching moment that both builds a lot of character development that the past two volumes lacked, but also a sense of empathy for their situations and the amount of burden they have to deal with while simultaneously having to save the universe countless times. Even with the emotional moments, the film wraps up on a fantastic high note, giving each major character proper closure as well as appreciation for the entire trilogy as a whole.

It's so lazy and boring and all the characters are just going through the motions. The humour is pathetic, but I'm sure audiences will chuckle at the bottom of the barrel jokes that were once fun but now repetitive.

During and after the release of Avengers: Infinity War James Gunn was fired as writer/director for this movie until Disney rehired him before the release of Avengers: Endgame! Let's start with the positives; the standouts of this film were Star-Lord, Mantis and Rocket! It's very funny and I thought Nebula was better than Gamora which is what I didn't like in this movie along with the song choices they weren't as good as Vol 1 & 2! Let's talk about the LEGO sets; I was surprised at how accurate they were to the film There are Guardians of the Galaxy HQ (which is what I'll get at some point), the new Guardians' Ship that's called The Bowie (named after David Bowie since the Milano was named after Alyssa Milano & the Benatar was named after Pat Benatar) and Rocket's Ship! Overall this was James Gunn's swan song for Marvel since he's now started his DCU by Directing Superman Legacy & the 2 post-credit scenes do set up the future of the MCU and quite possibly Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars!

I figured out that I really care about these characters. Action, emotion, and a great deal of humor. James Gunn is a truly talented guy. My guess is that he was given a lot of creative freedom.

Well the competition was not very strong, but James Gunn was able to write a compelling and emotional story with a great mix between funny moments and heartfelt ones. He did also a magnificent job behind the camera since his direction was excellent and he shot some scenes that will be iconic. All the main members of the Guardians have their journey but the central focus of the movie is Rocket Racoon and his past, since it is strongly related to the villain. Speaking of him, I have to admit it was a great surprise. He's not very deep or has somewhat relatable motivations but he is only so mean that you hate him and you want to see him dead in a bad way.

After two years of mediocrity a Marvel film that doesn't feel rushed out finally graces the big screen once more. At long last the Disney executives gave Gunn enough time to make a good film and it shows in how the tone, CGI, and direction aren't half baked and messy compared to projects like Black Widow and Thor 4. As expected Rocket's story throughout the film was heartbreaking and the High Evolutionary is established as one of the most despicable characters in the Marvel canon.

","I had a feeling that I would like this. It had a proper balance of heart, drama, comedy, and a compelling story. This was a movie that should have come out years ago, though. I thought the ending would be different, given that this is the last entry in Gunn's Guardians trilogy. However, even though it wasn't what I expected, I wouldn't want anything to be changed. It's a good experience when a movie doesn't give you what you expected, and you enjoy it even more. Unfortunately, I have a feeling that this is the last good Marvel movie for a while, unless they make some serious changes. They need to talented, experienced writers and directors like they used to. Make a fun, entertaining movie, that isn't pushing an agenda. Stop making everything episodic, and make one quality project at a time. Not a variation of intertwined shows and movies that aren't good on their own, or even form a compelling narrative when added together. Phase 4 is a perfect example of this, and Quantumania doesn't inspire confidence that this formula is going to change in phase 5, either. This movie was better than all of phase 4 combined, minus No Way Home, which wasn't entirely Marvel's work anyway. Marvel, take what has worked in the past, take notes, hire some talented writers/filmmakers, and stop making everything have a social or political message. Also, I have never seen a movie that was made better by studio interference. Filmmakers do their best when they are competent to begin with, and are left alone to make their project. Stop hiring people that have never worked on a movie before, and have the studio make all of the major decisions.

He gives all of these characters such human personalities that you can't help but fall in love with every single one of these characters. The villain here is the strongest of the series by far.

","Not a fan of the first 2 films but a fan of Rocket. The jokes land and hit a lot more in this movie compared to the first 2 while still keeping a more serious and darker tone narratively. Remains separate from the rest of the MCU and benefits by having most characters have growth albeit maybe too quick. This growth helps sell the story and the humour, but ultimately might be too little too late for most of the characters going forward, considering how it ends. Some slapstick comedy and song choices dont fit. Its a shame Adam Warlock is wasted and seems pretty pointless throughout could have been done without him. Some stylish action that looks exactly like comic panels or storyboards. With more comedy hitting and most characters getting growth in a story that is self contained this films does well in most areas, held back by trying to do a little too much but still a recommendation from me.

","Eric's Grade: B
It is not a shock to say that in recent years the MCU has lost its way somewhat. Up through 'Avengers: Endgame' the movies were all, more or less, on point. They introduced iconic film characters, and while all of the separate pieces told their own story there was an omnipresent push toward Thanos, the Infinity Stones and the 2 film conclusion that is one of the best things I have ever seen at the movies. It is clear the MCU wants to put forth another Infinity Saga film event, yet the characters and stories aren't connecting or functioning as well as the first time around. With that in mind it is not a shock to see that the best movies coming out of the MCU right now are still ones that harken back to the Infinity era. The Guardians are solidly first gen MCU and this film brings the story of the Guardians, as we know them, to a close. It is bittersweet as we have grown to love these characters, but in the end this provides them with a more than adequate sendoff. As with the previous two films this ultimate volume is written and directed by James Gunn, who brought more drama to the filming than anything contained within the script. He was fired and rehired by Marvel while also recently taking on the mantle of creative director for the DC films with whom he already cavorted directing the most recent Suicide Squad movie. Gunn drama aside 'Guardians 3' has gone on to get positive reviews from both fans and critics. All of the former cast members are back reprising their roles with the only trick being Zoe Saldana as Gamora. Saldana does play Gamora, but the alternate version of the character that appeared after the original Gamora died in 'Endgame'. Notable additions here include Will Poulter as Adam Warlock and Chukwudi Iwuji and the High Evolutionary.",/review/rw9055087/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_3_2023

The aspect of this movie that gives it a nine is the attention to detail in the CGI and the use of real-world technology in the movie. Each of the alien worlds had its own version of technology rather than seeing the same old thing again until you get to the trial world for all the modified species where it's just old earth equipment. I like to think the High Evolutionary did this to ""Save Money"". The Adam Warlock character is the only thing stopping me from giving a ten. The Depth of rockets life is an amazing story but the character Adam created by the High Evolutionary is just weak. I felt as the writers dropped the ball and only included him to make the ends of the movie work. They needed someone to save Quill and had no one so they halfway created this character and just kind of let it fall by the wayside.

893,6 May 2023,dakotadickenson-83457,10," A great send off for the Guardians of the Galaxy
","After years of waiting for the long awaited Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3, audiences alike have finally got to see this one of a kind film and it is unlike any other film that has ever come to the MCU and stands out on its own. It's definitely the most darkest and most emotional film to ever come to the MCU, making sure it pays its tributes and giving each of its characters a moment to shine bright. This movie reminds all fans alike what makes the MCU as great as it is. It gives us characters that we have come to love, the best and most proper send off they could have. After dealing with the loss of Gamora, Peter Quill must bring together the Guardians for a mission to save one of their own that may be the end of them if not successful. Hands down the stand out characters of the film is Peter Quill/Star Lord and Rocket Racoon, bringing us a side of the characters we have never seen before and probably the best versions of the characters we have ever seen. This was hands down Chris Pratt's best performance as Peter Quill/ Star Lord and shows us how far he is willing to go in order to save those he loves. As heart breaking as the scenes were to watch, I was glad that James Gunn was able to tell Rocket's full story on how he became who he is as unsettling as it was to watch at times. It shows how while also why he is one of the most important and broken characters ever in the MCU. Zoe Saldana's Gamora was also fantastic bringing us a different side of her character we have never seen before. Dave Bautista's Drax had some of the funniest lines of the entire film as well as Karen Gillian's Nebula. I was also glad to see more of Pom Klementieff's Mantis using her powers. Vin Diesel's Groot I also thought was a highlight of the film, bringing us a different kind of Groot than we have seen in the past. Maria Bakalova as Cosmo the Spacedog was great at voicing the character. Sean Gunn's Kraglin I was glad to see have more screen time than any of the other Guardian films and show off his own set of skills. Chukwudi Iwuji's High Evolutionary is absolutely terrifying, psychotic, and probably one of the most hateful villains of the MCU and the way he is able to capture all of his character's mannerisms is while also unsettling to watch, but fascinating, because of how good of a actor he really is making his villain one of the best in my opinion in the MCU just by how menacing he is. Will Poulter's Adam Warlock I was finally glad to see come the the MCU and he did not disappoint, although I felt like he wasn't used quite as much as he was anticipated to, he still had a great introduction for the MCU. When it comes to the visuals, this is definitely the most visually stunning of all of the Guardians of the Galaxy films. Overall, James Gunn has pulled off the proper send off for some of the greatest characters to ever come to the MCU, using great character arcs, a unsettling while also sometimes disturbing tone, great visuals, and a incredible story that leaves you feeling sad, but satisfied with the end result.

","SPOILER WARNING! I've made it known before that I've grown very tired of the MCU in the past year but my one glimmer of hope was this movie and I'm happy to report that this movie sticks the landing is probably going to be the last good MCU movie for a while. It's not as good as Guardians 1 or 2 but still great. The story has some problems in that there are A LOT of characters which leaves it feeling maybe a little overstuffed but even with that issue it's still a great story. Rocket's backstory is incredibly emotional and everything dealing with him are easily the best parts of the movie. I do wish however that the film had made some more bold decisions though. The film has too many fake out deaths to the point where it was a little obnoxious and it felt somewhat cheap when they don't kill anyone by the end. Don't get me wrong I love that all these characters got their happy ending but I think one major death would have made this movie a lot more emotional and well rounded. That was my major issue with the film. I also don't think it looks quite as good as Volumes 1 and 2. The film looks great and so does the action but the other two installments look just a little better. Speaking of the action, it's really great here. Each action scene is really great and well choreographed especially the ""No Sleep from Brooklyn"" scene. The soundtrack is great as well. Not as good as the soundtracks for the other films but still really good with some great tracks on there. One of my favorite aspects of the film was definitely the villain. It's fun having a villain that's just straight evil. No redemption no nothing. He's just straight evil and Chukwudi Iwuji does a fantastic job in the role. He's definitely going over the top with it but I think that works extremely well for someone who has what is essentially a god complex. The rest of the cast does a great job as well especially Bradley Cooper as Rocket. As I mentioned earlier, Rocket's backstory is the best and most emotional part of the movie and Cooper does an incredible job at helping you to feel those emotions. The humor also works very well here too. There were so many jokes that worked for me. I think the DCU will be in mostly safe hands after watching this. I'd definitely recommend checking this out especially if you love the Guardians movies.",/review/rw9055087/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_3_2023

First, it explored two important ideas from Immanuel Kant's philosophy: t""Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end."" and ""He who is cruel to animals becomes hard also in his dealings with men. We can judge the heart of a man by his treatment of animals."" . Second, it incorporated We3, a comic book by Grant Morrison and Frank Quietly, where three animals escape from a military experiment and go on a journey of survival and friendship.

Unfortunately, this film felt like it was trying to cram in too many plot points at a time, not allowing the viewer to breath or comprehend what they had witnessed/heard seconds before. It did not feel as polished (likely due to COVID restrictions), nor did it feel crafted with the same love, care and passion as the previous two. And with this being the ""final film"" for this franchise, I cannot say it was a satisfying ending. This films villain, played by the brilliant Chukwudi Iwuji, was very forgettable. I can't recall he was even given a name. His cruelty and harshness came off as very forced making it difficult to see him as a real threat. I also picked out a bit more than just a handful of editing/continuity errors (which often times I can overlook) but it was honestly quite annoying. Many of the comedy bits were either not funny or cringe inducing. I will say this film does have its moments, but the positives just weren't enough to outweigh the negatives.

","In the final part of the trilogy, the world - or at least ""one"" world - needs to be saved by the Guardians of the Galaxy while the group deals with its own internal issues. The premise without much complexity is common to hero movies, including good hero movies, as were volumes 1 and 2 of this series, and as is this Volume 3. The trilogy, since its inception, has highlighted the right mix between action and comedy, with a thin dose of drama to not make a fantasy involving a talking raccoon too silly. It was working very well. But the frustration with the hero movies of recent years - mainly the result of too many releases and little creativity in scripts underestimating the intelligence and patience of the public - ended up causing apprehension about Guardians 3. In the end, the action scenes seem more of the same - not many, to a remarkable extent. Negative points are also the initial 30min a little dragged and a poorly worked transformation that the ""new"" Gamora goes through. All this, however, becomes less important in the face of the best of the film, which comes from the unexpected: Rocket's touching origin, the foundation of the plot. Yes, it's the exciting scenes in the story of a raccoon that make Guardians 3 more than a good action movie: in addition to the already expected good comic footprint, there's a great drama, which gave a surprisingly positive density to this farewell... although the post-credits scenes may suggest what they suggest.",/review/rw9055087/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_3_2023

Some moments I really enjoyed and found interesting. Of course, the music was not forgotten either, as in every episode. To sum up. I left the cinema satisfied because, besides the good action, I also took away memories of a good plot that some of the more recent Marvel works lacked.

One thing I would say is that the characters have been written with more maturity this time so there's less cliche comedy this time. The movie really proves guardians journey well.

","I put this movie on hold, and although I really like Guardians of the Galaxy, I just wanted to let the hype surrounding it settle down before watching it. This outing for the franchise is perfect and serves as a spectacular reminder of how good Marvel movies can be when there is enough clarity, subtlety, and heart put into the story. It focuses more on the characters' journey, allowing the audience to connect with them on a deeper level and find elements that make them special. This movie evokes strong emotions and can be challenging to watch at times, mainly due to the incredible Rocket story that finally reveals the depths of what this beloved character has endured. This Marvel film stands out as one of the most emotionally engaging ones that I can remember, and I will always be grateful for that. The performances from the entire cast are exactly what you would expect-dynamic and enjoyable. It has been quite some time since we had such a formidable main villain that you can't help but root for their demise. The High Evolutionary reigns supreme with his narcissistic and evil demeanor.

","""Look how they massacred my boy"". This quote came to my mind many times while watching guardians three. While the guardians films were once considered peak MCU, this movie stands as an unfortunate reminder to how far Disney has let Marvel fall. The CGI was over the top, poorly animated and overly saturated, just like any other movie from Marvel's phase 4. While the cast certainly gave it their all, and Gunn's creativity can be seen in spurts throughout the film, it's not enough to redeem it in the end - even the vintage soundtrack that we've come to love from the past two movies felt out of place in half the scenes, as if it were thrown together randomly. On one end, you have the typical Disney quips that fall completely flat, and on the other you've got over the top gore for sheer shock value. While this movie will tug on your heart strings, most of it is through the emotional manipulation of ""cute animals in danger"". It's clear that Disney is too afraid to take any serious risks. Case and Point: At some point in the film, every single individual guardian brushes with death, but Disney is too afraid to follow through with actually killing off a character. Yes, it's nice to see a happy ending for all the characters, but a sacrifice from Peter or Drax would have made it slightly better.

","Back in 2014, Marvel Studios and director James Gunn introduced us to a little-known misfit ragtag from the comics called the Guardians of the Galaxy. Now, 9 years later, this unlikely crew has evolved into a family, and it's time for them to face the music. The ""music"" comes in the form of the High Evolutionary, the film's antagonist and Rocket's ""creator"". When one of the Guardians is wounded, the rest of the team must race against time to save their friend. Along the way, they're taken to some unique locations you won't soon forget. But that's only half of the film's plot, as the other is devoted to exploring Rocket's heartbreaking backstory and giving us more insight into our favorite trash panda. While he's certainly the standout of the film, though, every single character is handled expertly and given their moment to shine. Chris Pratt delivers perhaps his best performance as Peter Quill/Star-Lord, and Will Poulter makes an intriguing debut as Adam Warlock. As for the aforementioned High Evolutionary, Chukwudi Iwuji does a terrific job of portraying one of, if not the cruelest villains in the entire MCU. As the movie progresses, I went from disliking this guy to absolutely hating his guts, which in turn only made me cheer on our heroes even more. Besides the Guardians themselves, another cheer-worthy aspect of the movie is the music. In true James Gunn fashion, Guardians Vol. 3 treats its soundtrack almost as a character itself, utilizing it in a way that elevates and enhances the entire movie. Also, I have to give specific praise to the ending. This film contains, without exaggeration, one of my favorite final scenes of all time. It's bittersweet, heartfelt, joyous, and beautiful. I seriously don't think I've been this moved by a movie since 'Avengers: Endgame'. As a whole, 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3' is a fun, action-packed roller coaster of emotions full of unforgettable moments, and easily one of the MCU's best installments.

Hollywood has been looking over the shoulder while guiding the brush in an effort to enhance their investment, only to oppress directors into a standard artwork that becomes cliche and marginalized. Guardians 3 is a masterpiece, the cast of colors under Gunns brush have defined Marvel into a new dimension.",/review/rw9055087/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_3_2023

","This movie really concluded the guardians of the galaxy trilogy well, but despite the emotional depth and stunning special effects, the film is a bit flawed. First of all, they ended the film with the guardians of the galaxy completely being changed, now the only OG members remaining are rocket and groom, Peter went back to earth, mantis went off to discover herself, and drax and nebula are taking care of the children. They also made it seem like a few key characters were gonna die such as Peter and rocket. But the film is still good, the best part is gamora in this movie, she was so violently funny that I prefer her over the old gamora.",/review/rw9055087/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_3_2023

","Funny how James Gunn brings Vol.3 to save Marvel from the tide of bad movies but he's already out of the boat. Vol. 3 is pure emotion, with parts that hit hard (something only someone with authority and autonomy would do, unlike films directed by the house) as well as bringing Gunn's characteristic humor. The good music is there again, another signature of his (not as strong as in Vol.1). I confess that I missed someone's death, especially after some actors said they wouldn't return without Gunn (probably the studio didn't let them). It would be cool to show everyone's outcome, which doesn't happen, and the challenge remains for Marvel to command these characters without their commander, as well as to make the public (myself included) interested in the guardians without him. In the end, the movie is worth the ticket I had a great time and I wish Gunn the best of luck at DC.",/review/rw9055087/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_3_2023

","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 was a film I was nervous to watch especially after the recent slate Marvel had presented. But I must say it had exceeded my expectations but not to the level I would have hoped. The one thing I can admit to is that James Gunn knows how to balance comedy and emotional tones in a film as seen in past work and in this film. It did have a great performance out of the full cast, had great cgi scenes that didn't look outrageous or unwatchable, and Drax by far stole the show when it comes to jokes. My issue is that I was expecting this to be a strictly serious film considering the story that was announced focusing on Rocket and with them implementing so much comedy it took away from that sometimes and led to scenes I felt were too much. Another issue I had was with Adam Warlock, was introduced with a great scene and then was left in the background for the rest of the film being downgraded from Villain, to Side Character to then Extra. I was disappointed in this as we had waited since the end of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2(2017) and then got so little of his character as a whole to provide for a good character arc. Lastly I know that James Gunn had no say in the Gamora and Quill issue after infinity war, but their interactions/chemistry I must say I disliked that the most in this film. It felt like another bad breakup film instead of the full focus on Rockets story. Thankfully it did end with a good send off for all characters and conclude the journey this team has embarked on, just was not how I think anyone expected.",/review/rw9055087/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_3_2023

This made the pacing too slow, ruined the action scenes and of course made the film too long. Some meaningless scenes were inserted using known actors past their prime. The actors did well with what they had but the director/writer let his vision run away with the film. Despite that, I'd say he lost focus at the end and didn't know how to end the film.

","I want to say that I believe that James Gunn is an exceptional director and writer. In guardians 3 his influence and work is clear but perhaps too much. Reminding me much of Slither (a great film): grotesque, fleshy and monstrous it feels out of place for a marvel film. The emotional bar was set high on the back of guardians 2 so the film almost takes a cheaper route by injecting excessive animal cruelty for Racoons back story, which do pull on the heart strings and which are granted, difficult to watch at times but ultimately lack any further depth. And unfortunately the usual worn out marvel formula is still at play here: excessive forced humour and innuendos. I personally was extremely disappointed with the treatment of Adam Warlock, a powerful marvel character but who unfortunately, has been boiled down to a slapstick supporting character here. As an action sci fi film this is a good entry, but to a marvel fan, with knowledge of characters and plot this leaves something to be desired and although better than the latest outputs, can't do much to change the downward trajectory that marvel and Disney are on.",/review/rw9055087/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_3_2023

You can finally understand why Rocket was such a jerk to people, pushing them away emotionally. And that makes his growth through the films all the more impressive.

","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 was one of my most anticipated movies of 2023. I liked the first two Guardians movies and I think James Gunn is a really skilled director with movies like The Suicide Squad. He is good at making really entertaining movies with a lot of heart and emotion in the mix. He is also good at delivering jokes with his dark sense of humor. Lately, Marvel movies haven't really been my thing since Avengers Endgame. I enjoyed Shang Chi and really liked Spider Man No Way Home, but the others such as She Hulk, Ant Man and the Wasp Quantumania have been mediocre in my opinion. So I was really hoping that Guardians 3 would bring back my love for Marvel. Unfortunately, and I'm a bit sad to say this, it didn't. However, it was definitely one of the better films of Phase 4-5. It was certainly better than Quantumania but with the quality of Marvel these days, it was a let down. I really wanted to love this movie but there is so much going on in the film that I thought it was quite messy and uneven at times. Especially with the first act, the pace was slow and I found it hard to get into the story. The humor was also surprisingly weak and wasn't as well delivered as the first two. With the dark tone of the film, the jokes didn't blend in as well as the first two did. In films like this, and stories like this, we need those parts of levity but the jokes didn't land most of the time and it wasn't really funny, considering that it is a film from James Gunn also written by him. Nevertheless, there were some jokes that were kind of humorous but it didn't make me laugh out loud like some of the jokes in Vol 1 and 2. It's not that I didn't like everything in the movie, there are some parts I loved about it but it definitely leans heavier on the disappointing side. The aspect of the film I liked the most was Rocket's origin story, how he was tortured and experimented on by the villain, The High Evolutionary played by Chukwudi Iwuji who I thought was excellent with his debut role in the MCU. This storyline added the weight and emotional beats to the film very well, giving stakes to the characters and a sense of urgency. The main highlight of the film for me was Bradley Cooper as Rocket. This was definitely his best performance as this character. Some of the sequences in this film were really dark and intense. It gave so much more depth to Rocket and made the film a lot more investing for me. There were some emotional scenes that really tugged at my heartstrings quite a bit. The High Evolutionary was truly a terrible person and the things he does to Rocket and his friends introduced in the film was really messed up and horrible. But that is what I wanted in a Marvel movie for a long time, a terrifying villain that you hate so much, you just want to see the heroes take him/her down in the most badass way. They don't need to have an entire backstory or motive to make a compelling villain as long as he/she is menacing and a real threat to the plot and I think Iwuji delivered it well. The scenes with him were uncomfortable and frightening and that is when you know the capability of this actor. Speaking of new characters, Lylla the Otter, one of Rocket's old friends, was a standout considering how lovable this character was with the small amount of screen time she had. Adam Warlock, played by Will Poulter, was fine. He occasionally showed up from time to time to inflict harm in the movie. The scenes with him were mostly played for laughs since this character is portrayed as having child-like traits, not knowing his purpose in this life he doesn't know much about. I thought the action sequences with Adam gave some of the more exciting parts in the film. Although he does something essential near the end of the movie, this character felt a little under utilized throughout the film. The heart of the Guardians movies rely on the characters the most, especially the main team, Peter, Gamora, Drax, Nebula, Mantis, Groot and Rocket. Besides Rocket, the standout members of the team were Peter, Drax and Nebula, played by Chris Pratt, Dave Bautista and Karen Gillan. These four actors/actresses I felt carried this movie. Through Pratt's performance, you understand Peter's desperation, having lost his mother, father and lover, to save Rocket as he cares about the Guardians of the Galaxy more than anything. Bautista brought the heart and humor the most with Drax who continues to be one of my favorite characters of the Guardians trilogy. Lastly, Gillan who plays Nebula in the film really portrayed the character's growth from the first Guardians movie well and shows how much she understands the depth of the character. It also shows how much James Gunn cares about these characters and tries his best to flesh out the Guardians as much as he possibly could. Since Gamora isn't the Gamora we knew from the first two Guardians movies but instead a new version of this character from Endgame who doesn't remember all of the events of the previous films. I found this to be a flaw because the character that has been built up until Infinity War was erased and none of that mattered in this movie. Instead, Gamora was written as an angry character who slowly gets used to being with the Guardians by the end of the film which I thought wasn't as strong as it could've been. Groot and Mantis were just fine. Not much has changed and they remain to be who they were from the previous films. The reveal in the Holiday Special that came out on Disney Plus last year about Mantis being Peter's sister did help with some of the dialogue said in the film but didn't affect the story that much. Same with Kraglin and Cosmo played by Sean Gunn and Maria Baklava were also utilized just fine in the film. They had a purpose to be in the film and nothing much has changed about them. The film started to pick up with its pacing the most in the second act all throughout to the third act which I thought was the best portion. Some of the action that takes place in the final battle were some of the best action sequences Marvel has ever put out. The ending of the film, with this being the last time this group of Guardians together, was also fine. I liked how the trailers misled me into thinking the film was going to play out in a certain way when the actual film was going to play out differently. Although I had no problems with the ending they chose to do in the final product, I wished that there were more consequences to the Guardians instead of taking a more safe approach, after seeing how dark the film turned out to be. Overall, my consensus of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 is although story wise, it was better than Vol 2 and some of the Marvel projects that have come out recently, I think the execution of it could have been handled a bit better with a more organized story instead of having to juggle and balance many characters at once. Nevertheless, I found it to be a satisfying end to the Guardians trilogy by James Gunn and I am curious to see where they take these characters in the future. 7/10.",/review/rw9055087/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_3_2023

","This movie was fine in a world where Marvel is quickly falling from grace. Everything relating to Rocket was phenomenal. However, this movie is held back by some lackluster humor and a needless barrage of constant ""epic"" action moments. They had a great opportunity to really nail the Rocket backstory, but I don't think they trusted the audience to stay focused if there wasn't something constantly happening. But I think that's where Marvel has settled into in their post-Endgame world. They sacrifice good, quality story telling for cheap humor and over the top action sequences. At least this one still gave us some good story with Rocket. I'm just incredibly uninterested in MCU these days, and this movie really exemplifies it (without even being a ""bad"" movie).",/review/rw9055087/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_3_2023

","First time of my life i can't decide if a movie is bad or good. All critics are true, be it a 1 or 10 stars...this is the kind of movie that shows that this is truly an art form. Art varies from masterpiece like "" La Joconde"" to sticking a banana to a wall ....it's not for everyone, but everyone can find something appealing in it if you're looking in the right direction...On one side ( the good side ), it's an origin story....like everybody already knows ,it's rocket raccoon origin story and well, it's as strong, as unforgettable and as traumatising as the very first scene in the concentration camps in the first X Men movie.... I would not consider this movie for children for this part...a lot could be said about vivisection...but images worth a million words..and here it's perfectly filmed. No hope, no happiness, though animals try to live their best life in pure Hell..it's just traumatising and makes Rocket Raccoon an endearing character. You will cry..or you're a psychopath who should be in jail.. This part deserves an oscar and a 10 stars note..0 doubt... For the rest of the movie, it's so bad, it looks like it was written by a team of 10 yo schoolers on cocaine. It's true to its "" comics form"", it's clearly the unpredictable adventures of a band of misfits and like Ant Man 3, it's a CGI fest that will makes your eyes bleed...on very rare times there are good things visually, for the rest, it's just...what a drunken 10 yo schooler would imagine if he had to write something on his favorite superhero team...insane, illogical and very superficial...characters are one dimensional to the point of caricature, story is just jumping to one stupid thing to another even stupider thing. Gravity has no impact and you can survive without any injuries any crash landing, any fight, any situation because everything has the only purpose to make you laugh, but sadly it fails to do so.not even a smile.... So here it's a clear 0....which makes an average of 5 stars..should you see it ? Probably because it closes definitively the "" guardian of the Galaxy"" chapter and it's even more clearly the end of an era...the end of the MCU.

The writer has done justice and made the movie so surreal that it triggers your imagination and also gives you the emotional connection to it.

I saw multiple reviews calling this an animal rights activist movie but I didn't see it that way. The High Evolutionary wasn't just experimenting on animals but humanoids as well. Also the animals ceased to being animals once converted to higher order sentient beings. I no longer viewed them as animals. The High Evolutionary's willingness to destroy these higher life forms showed his arrogant elitism. I did not see any reviews mentioning trafficking. You wonder how he got his hands on all those children and animals. What cartels sold them to him? Just a side thought. The High Evolutionary's arrogance stating there was no God was blown away by Rocket's almost completed trip to Heaven. All of Rocket Raccoon story was by far and away the best part of this movie. Could have been better with even more of this and less forced humor/action. I was really hoping we would get to Rocket's abilities that the High Evolutionary wanted so bad. It was just dropped and I fear won't be revisited. Adam Warlock was a waste to me but I was glad to see more of Cosmo's abilities. All in all a good solid movie.

This makes a boring scene memorable and you can't help but feel giddy anticipation for the next one. This could be scene as playing it safe, e.g. Find a relatively unknown song that just somehow fits in a Guardians movie and play it during a boring transition scene.

So this move, I've seen 7-8 times and I might see it again today. Its captivating. Right from the start the main character, friendship, is front and center. Its refreshing to see Marvel characters save something other than the world, universe blah blah blah. In fact I don't see the Guardians as Marvel characters. They are so much richer and textured. How a dying raccoon can make me cry is inexplicable. We see them squashed on the road everyday here in Ohio. But to see any living being abused for the sake of ""improving"" another species is hard to take. Welcome consciousness to a world steeped in violence. But back to the movie. It is still unsettling to see Gamora and Quinn not get along. But apart from friendship, this movie is about finding yourself and being yourself. And Gamora is unyielding in this endeavor. She's ferocious in redeeming a free and independent version of herself. Another standout performance is from Will Poulter. The subtlety with which he plays a man-boy with great powers is charming. He is a kind of metaphor for the human race. Will's character gets ""it"" in the end after having his life spared by Groot. And thus becomes a Guardian himself. You will *marvel at Mantis as she duals with reality expressing courage tinged with playfulness and innocence. Lastly, Nebula. Karen Gillan is a master. She is playing a woman who has many of her biological parts replaced with man-made technology. She's angry, compassionate, logical and lovable.

","Hopeful movie in the last unfortunate MCU. I enjoyed this movie satisfactorily. The movie can be summarized as struggling to save the injured Rocket Raccoon. Members of the Guardians of the Galaxy learn about the Rocket's past in the process. The Rocket was originally Earth's raccoon, which was tested by High Evolutionary. Rocket suffered from animal testing, and how terrible it was for Guardians who watched the surgery to the end, and Nebula said that Nebula was even more terrible than him. Not only Rocket but also various animals have been tested, and their appearance is hideous. It seems to have clearly conveyed a negative image of animal testing with a High Evolutionary that ignores animal ecology and incredibly belittles life. This atrocity of High Evolutionary is deeply related to eugenics. The High-Evolutionary that is hard on eugenics makes us once again wary of eugenics It clearly conveyed the theme of the film by clearly conveying a negative view of eugenics and animal testing. The clarity of the subject matter of the film. Next, the movie ended well with the final installment of the series. Groot's I Love Guys. Means that I can understand Groot's words even for me who have been with me for a long journey. It seems that Rocket became the leader, but each person had the best ending.

","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 was a fun and emotional ride that concluded the saga of these cosmic misfits. The movie had a lot of action, comedy, and heart, and it focused on Rocket's tragic backstory, which was the most compelling part. Bradley Cooper gave a stellar performance as Rocket, and made me feel for him. The High Evolutionary was a scary and ruthless villain, and Chukwudi Iwuji nailed his role. The other actors were also good, especially Zoe Saldana as Gamora and Will Poulter as Adam Warlock. The movie had some issues, like the excessive use of flashbacks and the low stakes in the present, but they didn't spoil the overall enjoyment. The visual effects were amazing, and the soundtrack was catchy as always. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a great goodbye to these beloved characters, and I recommend it to anyone who likes Marvel movies. This movie restored my faith in Marvel movies after some disappointing entries, and I hope they keep making more films like this one.",/review/rw9055087/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_3_2023

I did not think that a third movie was necessary as I thought this movie was not nearly as good as the last 2 movies. The flow of the movie was not good.

1292,12 August 2023,propithongamer,8," JAMES GUNN NAILED IT!
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 stands as a triumphant continuation of the beloved cosmic adventure saga crafted by James Gunn. From its opening moments, the film immerses the audience in a whirlwind of emotions, humor, and electrifying action that leaves a lasting impression. The movie not only honors its predecessors but also expands upon their legacy, pushing the boundaries of storytelling and character development within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. One of the most remarkable aspects of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is its seamless blend of heart and humor. The characters we've come to love-Peter Quill, Gamora, Drax, Rocket, and Groot-are each given their moments to shine, deepening their connections and vulnerabilities. The emotional depth that Gunn infuses into their interactions is astounding; the witty banter is still present, but now there's a heightened sense of camaraderie that resonates on a profound level. As the Guardians face new challenges, the stakes are not just about saving the universe, but about preserving the bonds they've forged. The film's narrative structure is a masterclass in balance. Gunn effortlessly juggles multiple plotlines, giving each Guardian their own subplot while ensuring the overarching story remains cohesive. This allows for individual character growth that ultimately contributes to the collective growth of the team. Introducing new characters, like the enigmatic Nova Prime, played by an exceptional actor who seamlessly fits into the cosmic landscape, injects fresh energy into the narrative. Their interactions with the Guardians offer a nuanced exploration of morality and redemption, adding complexity to the already multifaceted themes. Visually, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a dazzling spectacle. The cosmic landscapes are vibrant and mesmerizing, painting a vivid backdrop for the Guardians' adventures. The CGI seamlessly integrates with practical effects, creating a world that feels tangible despite its fantastical nature. The action sequences are exhilarating and inventive, showcasing each Guardian's unique skills and personalities. Gunn's direction shines particularly in a gravity-defying space battle that rivals any other spectacle in the MCU. Every frame is a testament to the meticulous attention to detail and the director's passion for the source material. One of the film's standout elements is its soundtrack. Gunn's curation of music has always been a defining characteristic of the franchise, and Vol. 3 takes it to a new level. The carefully selected songs not only enhance the emotional beats but also serve as a narrative thread, tying the past to the present. Each track resonates with the scenes it accompanies, creating a synergy that elevates both the music and the storytelling. This mastery of sound and image is emblematic of the film's overall brilliance. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 also tackles weighty themes with finesse. It delves into concepts of identity, belonging, and the power of chosen family. The characters' arcs mirror real-life struggles, making their journeys relatable and poignant. The film doesn't shy away from addressing the consequences of past actions, exploring redemption and forgiveness in a way that feels authentic and profound. As the Guardians confront their own histories, they're forced to reckon with their mistakes, leading to moments of introspection that are as moving as they are thought-provoking. In conclusion, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a cinematic masterpiece that encapsulates the essence of what makes the Marvel Cinematic Universe a cultural phenomenon. James Gunn's visionary storytelling, combined with exceptional performances and technical prowess, results in a film that transcends its genre. It's a testament to the power of storytelling to evoke laughter, tears, and introspection in equal measure. As the Guardians' journey continues, audiences are treated to a breathtaking adventure that solidifies their place in the pantheon of iconic cinematic heroes.",/review/rw9055087/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_3_2023

The Coolest scene for me is when the Guardians meet up again and everyone fights on the ship. And I love that Rocket finally used his comic accurate name Rocket Raccoon. And I Also love the fact that King Groot is in it! And there's so much stuff I like with the movie. I can't go over everything. One of the strongest parts of the movie is Rocket's backstory and When his friends got shot, it wasn't the fact that They got shot that almost made me cry, it was his reaction to it, just standing there screaming and then slashing The High Evolutinary was just icing on the cake. We all thought somebody would die, but we had wrong and I'm happy that everyone survived, but what died was the Guardians team we all know and love, they disbanded and I love the ending for all of them. I will just go over some of the negatives now. So the first negative I have is that there was way too many fake-outs, I think everyone in the team had atleast one fake-out death and it became kinda annoying When I felt sad because I was afraid for a character to die but then they survived, as I said I'm happy all survived but the fake-outs kinda became a bit annoying. The other negative is more of a question, where was Star-Lords mask and rocket boots during the movie? They were just gone and they would've been really helpful in some scenes. I hope that we get to see them when he returns. That leads into my third and final negative, that is that in the final post-Credit scene, the scene itself is really good, but then we see the text ""The Legendary Star-Lord will return"" and I got kinda confused since we just saw him taking a break and retire, but I wish the text wasn't there since he retired and it was kinda weird when we just set up that he's retiring and now it says he will return.

The cast walks through their parts with little interest, similar to Chris Pratts last Jurassic Park film.

Now it seems they had it right and should have left him free to go to DC without this final picture.

It's definitely the goriest guardians movie with a man's face being peeled off at the end with flesh being shown underneath as well as lots of animal testing in rockets past which leads to disturbing robotic animals. Personally I was really upset with this film as the previous ones are really humorous and genuinely nice to watch but this was much darker and disturbing and I felt it had little humour. I saw this with my dad who said that he was concerned that people brought children that looked around the ages 7-9 he said as a parent he hopes this movie doesn't scare children when they leave, to put this into perspective I am 18 and have watched most marvel films including Deadpool (which is did not find scary at all just dark humour) but this guardians film had me crying because I found it so disturbing. I find it really sad that marvel has become so dark, for those that enjoy the MCU you will understand what I mean when I say marvel has turned dark because when you compare the first marvel movies to this such as iron man and captain America it has become inappropriate for younger viewers where it was ok for all ages originally, wether this is due to a change in hands with directing I don't know but it has become too dark for me.",/review/rw9055087/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_3_2023

I hope Marvel understands what the audience needs and such a nightmare as She Hulk, Miss Marvel, Eternals and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever will never happen again.

The jokes are there but are used in a way that's actually enjoyable and doesn't kill mood. One of the action sequences was one of the best I've seen.

In any case, this film closes a magnificent trilogy to see the best of the MCU for me. I'm still sad that it's over unfortunately, I still hope to see some characters in the next movies (rocket, Groot or Star Lord, the most likely characters to reappear...). I note all the same the disappointment of the villain of the film, even if the evolution of the antagonist is really brilliant I note however, the ""ease"" to defeat him honestly at the end of the film.

I was disappointed with how Adam Warlock turned out though, as in the comics he is one of the singular most powerful characters in Marvel. Moving on, the soundtrack was fantastic. One of my favourite songs from the film, 'In the Meantime', by Spacehog, has become one of my favourite songs ever. I love that at the end, Rocket becomes leader of the Guardians, Drax becomes a dad again and Groot's first words aside from 'we/I am/ are Groot', saying, 'I love you guys'. Overall, brilliant film, the High Evolutionary was a good villain for the it, and I am 100% positive I cried at least once.

","It's a great comedy, adventure movie. Btw it's one of the best movie by MCU. After endgame. They showed rockets origin story even though they shows importance of every character in the Guardian of the galaxy team. The way they show dam warlock after that I rate this movie 9 out of ten . And youndus scene is a great part of this movie and the movie keep u with all characters in the movie. And starting from rockets origin story is a great decision by makers of the gaurdians of the galaxy . And one more thing I love from this movie is mentis's mentality and maturity the way she going in the movie and controlling 3 monsters is a great feat for her. Gamora and peter's love story is a good idea what I expect. After all its a great movie love from India 🇮🇳 for marvel movies . And I love gaurdians of the galaxy team 👍👍",/review/rw9055087/?ref_=tt_urv,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_3_2023
