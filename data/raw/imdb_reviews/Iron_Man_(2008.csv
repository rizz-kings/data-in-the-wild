0,12 August 2014,TheLittleSongbird,9," A Marvel superhero film done with class
","When it comes to ranking the Marvel superhero(live action) films, Iron Man is for me up there with the better ones. It looks fabulous, the whole film is very slickly made with top-notch special effects(which look like time and effort was really put into it), awesome-looking futuristic gadgets and Iron Man's suit will be a guaranteed delight to anybody who is familiar or loves anything to do with the superhero. There is a pulsating soundtrack that adds much to the tension of the first half of the story and the enormously fun action sequences, which are exciting and tense with expertly choreography. The script crackles with smart humour that doesn't go overload, all of which is laugh-out-loud funny, yet the hostage plotting that takes up the first part of the film is intelligently written and somehow avoids being over-serious or over-familiar. The story has enough to allow you to emotionally connect with Iron Man(who I've always considered one of Marvel's most interesting and multi-faceted characters) and has a clever mix of the comic's 1960s origins and the effects of contemporary war, which will provide plenty of nostalgia while also feeling relevant. Jon Favreau does a great job directing, he never loses control of the story and he doesn't do anything too fussy. Robert Downey Jnr's performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man is a power-house and one of his best, doing much with the smart dialogue while making the emotional side of the characters wholly believable. Gwyneth Paltrow is a good, loyal side-kick with wise-cracks that don't come across as annoying and Jeff Bridges is surprisingly very good in an against-type role. Personally, the only disappointments were the useless character of Christine Everheart and the somewhat rushed and over-blown finale that wasn't quite as thrilling as it could have been, other than that Iron Man was a classy addition to the Marvel cannon and a great film on its own. 9/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

","There was a big question mark looming over the theatrical adaptation of Marvel's Iron Man property. It was in the guise of director Jon Favreau. Now, don't get me wrong, I love the Favs, but when I heard he was helming a big budget comic book flicklet's just say I was a little worried. Once his cast was set and the fanboys started humming across the internet I started to ease into the decision with high anticipation. Thankfully, after finally seeing the finished product, I was not disappointed in the least. With a great mix of the professionalism and stakes seen in both Spider-Man and X-Men and the comic wit and sheer fun of Fantastic Four, Iron Man shows how a comic can be brought to the screen successfully without all the added drama and weight. We finally have a film with the essence of what makes these picture books so popular, the action and mythology along with a sense of adventure and humor. Favreau never bogs us down with overwrought emotions nor speaks down to us with gags and poorly written jokes. Instead he delivers on his promises and gives us a solid initiation into what could be a great trilogy or more.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

","Iron Man, the huge kick off to the big summer blockbusters of summer 2008, a great start. I have to say that originally I had my concerns, when I saw the trailer, this movie looked way over done and Robert Downy, Jr. as the hero? The guy is a great actor, but as a super hero? I wasn't so sure, but I was able to see Iron Man today and all my doubts were put behind me as I watched. This is one of best comic book adaptations put to film in a very long time, since the original Spider Man I think. The effects were not actually too over the top, only when needed, but it gave that extra feel of a comic book. Robert Downy, Jr., I couldn't believe how well of a performance he pulled off, there still is a little question of his casting, but he pulled off Tony Stark seamlessly. This is a very entertaining action film and is such a great blockbuster that is sure to please any film buff.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

","With a little tinge of shame and regret, my rare dalliances with the Iron Man character stemmed from a few one off comic books, as well as occasions during the teenage years of spending time in the arcade with those Marvel games, where Iron Man was one of my preferred characters because it came together with his incredible arsenal of weapons from repulsor beams to this gigantic cannon which accompanied the execution of some complex combo moves. There's something sexy about the red and gold suit of armour, and having an array of weapons at the disposal of a player, makes perfect sense for variety in dispatching your enemies.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

11,23 April 2008,sacflyzone,10," Delivers Intelligence & Great Acting with its Fun
","Rest assured, Iron Man is an absolutely amazing movie. I won't dare spoil any of this remarkable movie for you but I do recommend it as highly as I possibly can. Marvel needed to get in to the solo movie making business long ago. Instead of leasing out their characters to other studios, they're making movies themselves. Most everyone knows Iron Man is their first effort and what a great lead off film! This movie helps take the comic book genre to the highest level. Just like they did in the books, they reinvent standard epic adventure by ""Marvelizing"" characters and making them more believable. The Spider-Man and the X-Men movies did this to a degree but only as far as their respective studios wished to stay true to the source material. Anything added or amended was for the benefit of the live action adaptation. Director Sam Raimi pulled this off by talking to the summer crowd, not down to them with the Spider-Man series. Jon Favreau has done the same thing here but I think he's done it even better. Raimi intentionally threw in a little cheese. Favreau adds nice bits of humor but not too much. He also grounds the action and the suit of armor in firm reality. I've said it before but it's brave to reach for the highest common denominator with a big budget film and Favreau delivers a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity. Needless to say, Robert Downey Jr. and company deliver the goods. It's a movie that has a wonderful balance that delivers intelligence with its fun.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

This is the movie we have been waiting for this year. So does it match up to expectations? Hell yes! On the surface, 'Iron Man' isn't very different from other superhero films but on the other hand it isn't like any other superhero movie.

","All too infrequently, a much hyped blockbuster hits the mark with such power that it resonates above all others. Mark my words, Iron Man is such a movie. I've been privileged enough to view an advanced screening and, honestly, it's the best big budget movie that I've seen in many years. It hits a high standard of excellence for mass audiences by combining humor, a smart plot, breathtaking action sequences, a heavy dose of self discovery and realization, betrayal, forgiveness, love and puts it all together in one amazing package. The special effects and CGI are probably the best I've ever seen in terms of relatable effects. They're not over the top and don't overwhelm your senses. What's even more remarkable is this movie will surprise a lot of people with its depth while sacrificing none of the fun. The inner turmoil worked well, the beautiful thing is that we can relate to each character, especially that of Tony Stark. Stark's indomitable charm mixed with his flawed character makes this hero more interesting then most. Iron Man delivers action with great emotional moments and a movie that lives up to all the hype it has generated.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

","Iron Man is one of the better superhero movies. It's based off the popular Marvel comics. On one of the reviews, I was shocked to see that the person liked the new Hulk better. I agree that Hulk is a great movie, but Iron Man is 100 times better. Tony Stark, a popular weapons company owner gets kidnapped by a cult called ""Ten Rings"" in the Middle East. They want Stark to build a weapon for them. Instead he builds his Iron Man suit. He eventually escapes and later becomes Iron Man. Will he have revenge on the cult and it's surprising leader? You'll have to watch to find out. The acting is better than expected in this film. Robert Downey Jr. did such a unexpected great job. Gwyneth Paltrow did well as her role of Pepper Potts. I also liked Terrence Howard as Rhodey. The special effects were great as they are with superhero movies. The plot has its share of intriguing twists.

Tony Stark is a genius weapons manufacturer whom is kidnapped in Afghanistan during a missile demonstration. In captivity he builds a suit of armor that would become his Iron Man persona. Director Jon Favreau establishes a plot that flows without pause. Favreau previously sprung success with the Christmas comedy Elf. Robert Downey Jr. plays off the sarcasm of Stark. He is wealthy yet intelligent as he must survive several months of captivity as well as confront a corrupt mind that was formerly on par with himself. Gwyneth Paltrow plays his loyal assistant who rises above being a standard damsel. She is instrumental in his recovery as well as becoming a safe source for his ideas. Jeff Bridges plays the villain whom uses Stark's weapons against him. They were friends at first until he becomes corrupt and musters into something of opposite proportions to Stark. Only Terrence Howard seems cardboard in his standard military role and friend that hardly elevates beyond routine. Shaun Toub plays a captive of Stark's but the character is apparently changed from his comic book identity.

I'm not going to say he's the perfect Tony Stark because Downey's Stark is really very different from how he has always been in the comics. But it works far better this way and is a huge point in favor of deviating from the source material, which is the eternal struggle between Hollywood and anything it adapts. This is one case where the changes they made worked out great. The rest of the cast is terrific, all following Downey's lead very well. His enthusiastic performance is a joy to watch. I'm sure it must have been a ball for Paltrow, Bridges, and the rest to act with him as they all seem to be having a great time in their scenes together. Jon Favreau does a praiseworthy job of directing, especially when he hadn't really done this type of movie before. The action and special effects are great. The script is smart and funny, though a lot of the humor comes from the ad-libbing of Downey and co-stars, so I'm not sure how much credit I can give the script for that. It's really a wonderful piece of entertainment without being mindless or crude. One of the best superhero films ever made.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

And you've got to appreciate the casting of Jeff ""the Dude"" Bridges as a super villain (kind of a spoiler, I suppose, but if you don't see that coming you're a bonehead). Favreau finds a way to make Bridges enormous and intimidating in every shot, even while riding a Segway, which is a triumph of some sort.

It would seem director Jon Favreau has found the answer. From the opening chords of AC/DC's ""Back in Black"" it becomes instantly apparent that Iron Man is going to be a different kind of comic book movie. Instead of the filmmaker's usual aspirations to have the source material adapted as darker and grittier than its comic book origins could ever have been, Favreau is not afraid to embrace a very much needed sense of fun without descending into the rampant silliness which consumed Tim Story's Fantastic Four. As such, Iron Man essays a superb balance between embracing every last enjoyable detail while maintaining the gravitas and complexity of its original story and characters, a seamless melding of intelligence and action clout.

Downey plays the snarky, irritating Tony Stark to A+ in my book, being a truly prominent warmonger... until he isnt. Later, being captured by some Afghan guerilla (probably with good reason, since Stark provides weapons), he proves his brilliance by making Iron Man suit Mark I. I dug how mechanical and primitive it all looked. Compared to a dozen years later, IM 1 looks refreshingly more old school technically, and Jon Fevrau has no rush really to show us all the action. This is more a redemption story about Tony Stark, coming to terms not only with how he (and his dad) has become billionairs, but also his own mortality (that splinter that's inches from his heart). Off course, the 3rd part of the movie goes all in CGI, with a weak villain in Jeff Bridges (I love him, but here he is way OTT). In the end a very good intro too the everlasting MCU.

Another thing, how does Obadiah get into Tony's house so easily in the first place? Wouldn't you think a genius billionaire like Tony Stark has a halfway decent security system or that Jarvis would've notified Tony? Lastly, how is Obadiah able to master the nuances of his suit immediately without having any trial phase? It took Tony quit a while to master his suit's various functions and yet Obadiah was able to do this right away.

When his father died when he was still young, the company went into the safe hands of friend and partner Obadiah Stane but, at 21, Stark came back onto the scene as head of the company and, it must be said, something of a playboy with a deserved reputation for loving woman and having a general cavalier attitude to life. However a weapons demonstration in the Middle East changes that when he is captured by terrorists and made to build them weapons. He escapes by building himself a mechanical suit and blasting his way out, but the experience has changed him and on his return to the US announces that the firm is dropping out of arms manufacture  an announcement that dismays Stane and the board, but not as much as his other plans would.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

137,5 May 2008,george.schmidt,10," High-octane thrills and a lot of fun; Downey & cast score an instant classic and one of the very best comic book adaptations committed to the silver screen
","IRON MAN (2008) **** Robert Downey, Jr. , Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, Terrence Howard, Leslie Bibb, Shaun Toub, Faran Tahir, Clark Gregg. Rip-roaring big screen adaptation of the Marvel Comics' cult-classic superhero AKA billionaire extraordinaire Tony Stark (Downey having a field day), an industrialist/arms manufacturer who has his eyes opened to the horrors of his financial gains when he is kidnapped by terrorists and manages his escape by creating an armored suit as his ticket to freedom and regrouping by protecting those he has put in harms way. But his sudden moment of clarity has a price to pay in the form of his second-in-command Obadiah Stane (Bridges having a devilish time here) who poses as a formidable foe in the long run. Screenwriters Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway hammer out a competent, sharp and clever storyline that incorporates origin story cum legend with strong support by director Jon Favreau (who has a bit part as Stark's valet) incorporating stunning ILM CGI, and wisely allowing his actors to shine, particularly Downey's sexy/brainy/snarky Stark with sterling clear-eyed focus and dollops of humor that take off the edge of 'serious'ness, resulting in a humdinger popcorn crowd pleaser and sooth-sayer to the fan boys. Paltrow, in one of her finest turns, is also a breath of fresh air as Stark's personal assistant/love interest Pepper Potts and Howard's unconventional performance as his best bud Jim Rhodes, a military liaison, proves a primer of how a second banana should be played. High-octane thrills and a lot of fun (including the inevitable- and arguably the funniest  Stan Lee cameo) an instant classic and one of the very best comic book adaptations committed to the silver screen; cannot wait for the sequel!",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

","Based on the iconic comic book character, 'Iron Man' follows a weapons engineer who manufactures a flying armor suit and has to stop those interested in copying the suit for their own evil purposes. Robert Downey Jr. is well cast as the arrogant, wise-cracking protagonist. Shot down in the Middle East, his shock and utter disbelief over his weapons being sold on the black market, causing more harm than good, never quite rings true. His naivety does, however, allow for a solid character progression as he goes from only caring about how much money his company makes to genuinely caring about how his weapons are used. The film spends a refreshingly large amount of time on Downey's back- story too; there are only scattered action scenes during the first half of the movie as the focus is always making Downey's flawed character likable before he turns superhero. The other characters are sadly less interesting. Unrecognisable at first with one zany hairdo, Jeff Bridges has some fun bits, but the likes of Terrence Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow are given little to do; the film also keeps going back and forth on the possibility of Paltrow as a love interest for Downey. Between the film's robot butler, the in-depth character back-story and Downey's charisma, 'Iron Man' has a lot going in its favour, but whether it is truly one of the better superhero movies out there is debatable.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008
139,4 May 2008,desire_911,8," Great movie
","After watching the overblown Spider-Man 3 last year; and the special effects driven Transformers, I was beginning to think that Hollywood didn't know how to make a decent comic book movie anymore. Then Jon Favreau directed Iron Man. The first thing that he does right is casting Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark. He brings a presence to the character that only he could and has the greatest one-liners that would even put Spider-Man to shame. Jeff Bridges, Terrance Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow are also great in their supporting roles. I loved the banter between Pepper and Stark. However, some fans may be disappointed by the lack of CGI and action scenes but I think it works for the better. It's grounded in reality and unlike Transformers, this film has realistic special effects and the CGI seamlessly blends in with all of the practical effects; most notably the Iron Man suit. And after watching Stark tinker around with his first two prototypes (watching the scene in which he tries to fly is priceless), it's a real payoff when after an hour we finally get to see him in action. This makes more sense than other comic book adaptations because we get to see the suit in three different stages. And besides all the action it's the most fun I've ever had watching a movie. There are so many scenes that end with a punch you won't regret watching this with a large audience. Not to mention that it ends on a great note. Also, comic book fans will dig the hints at a sequel and especially the post credit scene. Fans in our theater went crazy. (I won't spoil it for you.) Bottom line, Iron Man Delivers what a good comic book film should. It may not have the brooding darkness of Batman Begins, or the over the top special effects of Transformers, but it's a fun movie that has a terrific blend of humor, a great story, and not to mention some kick-ass action to go along with it. In the end my score is 8.5/10 ""B""",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

But if you were a fan, you couldn't help but know about the alternative universe that contained Spider-Man, The Incredible Hulk, The X-Men and Iron Man, which brings us to the subject at hand. I thought that the movie did a credible job of spanning the forty year comic book history of Iron Man about as well as could be expected in a distilled down two hour movie. Particularly effective was the way we see how the origin costume in the picture pays tribute to the early Iron Man years, while the modern day red and gold armor conveys the advance of science and technology into the twenty first century. Comic book purists will most likely have serious issues with the picture, but I've been able to get over the whole faithfulness to continuity issue some time ago.

","Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is the head of a large firm that makes devastating weapons of warfare. His father, who founded the company, was responsible for the A-bomb, among other achievements, and he schooled his genius son in the ""fine"" art of making killing devices. Now, Stark has rock-star status in the world, for he is also very handsome and rich. On a trip to Afghanistan, with Colonel James Rhodes (Terrence Howard) as a guide, Stark shows the Allied Forces his newest creation. All of a sudden, the company is ambushed and Stark is taken prisoner. Once in captivity, a fellow scientist saves his life by implanting a mechanical device in his heart, for the shrapnel that remains in his body could kill him. Now, the Afghan meanies want Stark to re-create his latest weapons for them and give him any materials he requests, within reason. But, in his new laboratory-cave, Stark instead develops a unique bit of armor that can withstand almost any attack. Naturally, with this metallic suit, he breaks out of his prison and gets rescued, nevertheless leaving bits and pieces of the armor behind. Once back in Malibu, he informs the press that his company won't be making any more weapons. This angers his longtime co-worker, Obadiah (Jeff Bridges) and puzzles his ultra-efficient personal assistant, Pepper Potts (Gywneth Paltrow). In secret, Stark begins to work on a new suit of armor that will far surpass his original work. Thus, he becomes ""Iron Man"", a human with the ability to fly and take out the bad guys. Will he save the world? This is an excellent, excellent film, one of the best, if not the BEST, of 2008. First, the cast is terrific. Downey's great manic abilities are slightly in check but he delivers his lines with energy, humor, and compassion. As such, he is one of the most likable comic book heroes ever put up on the screen. Bridges, too, is a marvel, as he totally ""hides"" in his role as the supposed friend who crosses over into the dark side. He should most definitely receive an Oscar nomination for his work. As for Paltrow, she is beautiful, intelligent, wry, and touching, nicely balancing the mostly male cast with her strong showing. Howard is one great sidekick and the rest of the cast, although mostly unknowns, are very fine. One must mention that the costumes and sets are wonderful, too. As for the special effects, the script/story, and the direction, they are absolutely mind-blowing and will transfix almost any audience out there. In short, my advice is to go, and go now, to arrange a showing, for this is one of the best ""big-money"" movies ever made.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

","Iron man great film. It is more faithful to the comic book that inspired it. Robert Downey JR is the film he hits the ground running from his first scene and never stops running, RDJ plays Tony Stark like a lazy Howard Hughes/James Bond wannabe with a little bit of Hugh Hefner tossed in. He does not lack confidence and he almost has a childlike naive way of looking at life. Until a life altering and threatening accident places him in the hands of terrorists who demand he create a weapon for them. Stark creates something but not for them he creates a Armor with enough weapon power to take out an army which he proceeds to do. once home he realizes that he must take account for his actions his company makes weapons of mass destruction he must make amends thus is born Iron man a avenger out to protect the world from those who terrorize and commit atrocities on a massive scale. Jeff Bridges is superb as Stane, Stark's partner who betrays him and creates the Iron Monger a suit more powerful then Iron man's. the battle scenes are breath taking and suspenseful This movie delivers on all cylinders and fulfills any Iron man fan they even play Black Sabbith's IRON MAN and you know the movie is going to be fun when it pokes fun of itself by playing it over and over again specially in the background. One thing I must admit is this . the director made a movie better then the comic from which it came. This movie is a family movie deep down in it's iron plated heart it delivers action some romance some development in the form of Tony Stark as he grows from a spoiled man who does not take any accountability whatsoever for his actions to a Iron Plated hero out to not only take responsibility for his actions but those of others as well.

This is arguably one of the best origin stories the MCU has offered up yet, having some memorable scenes throughout. Favreau worked in some great cohesive elements to juice up Tony Stark's back story, to give him some nice depth. It was such a nice relief that this wasn't just a stepping stone, to get a main character introduced, and that be it; Favreau gave us great context to who Stark is, and where he comes from. With Stark's back story set aside, the premise of the film wasn't the most original concept, with some cliché and predictable moments, but it's fine with Kevin Feige adding that Marvel flare throughout the film. The pacing of the film was decent for the most part, until the third act, and thats where the film takes it's major down turn.

","I got a kick out of this film. I have never seen one of the comic books nor do I know about the exploits of this figure. It is a nicely done superhero film which traces the origins of the character. Robert Downey is quite good, balancing his innate arrogance against his good intentions. Jeff Bridges is also an excellent adversary. One of the most impressive scenes in the move is the opening in the deserts of Afghanistan as a roadside bomb explodes and Downey and a group of soldiers come under fire. It really gives one a sense of what those people face each day. It may even be a bit real for a fantasy romp like this is. It is down and dirty. There are great events, including the building of the first suit and his effort to exact revenge against the forces that have used his weapons systems to persecute and destroy the civilian population. There is a lot of action and it's not superfluous. Downey's relationship with Gwyneth Paltrow and the robots in his lab are a lot of fun. For pure escapism, it's really fun.

","Spider-Man 3 and Ghost Rider SUCKED to the highest extent of the comic-to-movie craze of the millennium. 2007 was a bad year for superhero movies so I came in with low expectations to see Iron Man. The previews looked good but I feared I will be disappointed again and suspect that Marvel has lost its touch after the first two Spider-Man and X-Men films. Well, to be honest I was THOROUGHLY impressed and ENTERTAINED at the same time!!! This film EASILY blows those two crapfests mentioned earlier out of the water completely with an intelligent and well written plot, good acting, action, special effects and most importantly character development, something Sider-Man 3 completely neglected to do. The less said about Ghost Rider the better. But the real star of the show is no doubt the unlikely casting choice of Mr. Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark/Iron Man. His performance really caught me off guard in almost every aspect as a charming, no-nonsense, weapons-making womanizer whose at first glance ""imbeded"" with man's destructive nature but ultimately rises with a heart of gold. Gwyneth Paltow is both sexy and sweet as Stark's secretary who keeps him from slipping further; nice to see a woman whose smart and sexy with real depth in a comic book movie. Jon Favreau's direction is top-notch and knows the material well; moreover, this is the first Marvel film made independently of any major studio. I also like that the Iron Man armor is a combination of CGI and practical effects, helped along by Stan Winston, the king of practical movie effects and his work and attention to detail is very impressive as shown in the past. Though there's lots of humor in Iron Man, it never becomes overbearing and OTT like Spider-Man 3 whose idea of humor is more on the lines of an SNL sketch. My only negatives are some underdeveloped characters and the liberties taken with the Iron Man comics (Tony Stark being captured in Afghanistan rather than Vietnam, not delving into his alcoholism) but those are miner hiccups in an otherwise stellar movie.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

","This isn't a awesome spectacular superhero movie, but it's still well crafted and entertaining. Iron Man is a Marvel superhero that stood out to me and in this, it gave me more interest in Iron Man and even Tony Stark the man behind the suit. Robert Downey Jr. really carried the movie in this as Tony Stark, the way he acted felt close to the comic book. Not exactly like the modern comics that has Iron Man in it but close enough. This is a origin of how Iron Man came to be and the build up of it all is nicely done. The build up is a long process but I wasn't necessarily bored by just watching how Tony Stark becomes the Iron Man. Jeff Bridges did a great job playing Obadiah Stane, he didn't have a lot to work with here. But when he was on the scene his presence was ominous and fit right in while also being intriguing to watch. I watched the movie ""Enron: The Smartest Guys In The Room"" and he reminded me of the greedy and power hungry higher ups in a company. It's a shame his character wasn't developed all that well, but again this movie is about Tony Stark. Gwyneth Paltrow also did a good job of playing Pepper Potts, she did the perky and cute assistant thing well. The main flaw about this movie is that it just doesn't have enough Iron Man in it. I know the build up had to be a long process to show how it all happened in a short amount of time as possible but it would have been nice if it had like 2 or at least 1 more scene with Iron Man in action. Overall though this is a well crafted superhero movie that is a good blend of realistic and sci-fi that fits right into a comic book universe. It's a shame the next sequel won't be as good.

From his fast-talking hyperactive demeanor and the edgy, nervous intelligence of his eyes to his expressive face and understated body language, he really IS Tony Stark, completely believable as a high-tech genius used to living on his mind and nerves (and alcohol) alone. (I'm guessing the buff physique is just something he cultivates to make sure he looks good in those expensive suits.) Playing Stark as a wired 21st century media star instead of the outdated stereotype of the suave high-living playboy is a brilliant stroke, and his crisis of conscience is completely convincing without being at all maudlin or overdone. --Downey's just great in this, and I publicly apologize for not having had any confidence in him, cos this could not have been played better.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

","Iron Man is truly one of the best comic book films out there. Robert Downy Jr. was a questionable choice to many to cast as Tony Stark. Rob has proved them wrong as RDJ's performance is the best part of this film. Tony Stark a cocky, full of himself, multimillionaire has made billions on selling weapons. But when a trip to the middle east goes wrong, Tony finds out just how "" good"" his weapons are doing to the world. Tony builds a suit of armor to escape capture and when he gets home vows to change himself and the company. What ensues is a vicious power struggle against Obidiah Stane ( Jeff bridges) and the creation of Iron Man. The special effects are very well done and believable. One complaint is that there isn't very much action, but there are several well done scenes. The supporting cast is very good especially Gwenyth Paltrow. The dialog is smart and funny. The reference to SHIELD and Samuel Jackson after the credits are very exciting. Although my favorite comic book movie still goes to Batman Begins, iron Man is a very good film.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

A near-fatal accident in the Afghan desert leaves him with an artificial heart, and for the first time allows him to see the repercussions of his business endeavors. A changed man, he decides to pull the plug on weapons marketing and surreptitiously builds a state-of-the-art iron suit that gives him the capability to combat rebel militia groups who've acquired his technology under the table...but unfortunately that's easier said than done. Marvel Comics adaptation is less fanciful than most of its predecessors but certainly true to the genre, well-cast with intriguing (and believable) characters, spectacular action/effects sequences, and an engaging hero, the only thing it lacks is a human story compelling enough to sustain its length. ***",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

The film may be a bit light on action but what it does have is character development plus lots of humor, drama, some suspense, and thrills. The action sequences are well choreographed and most of them happen toward the second half of the film. The special effects are fantastic especially when Tony puts on the suit and becomes Iron Man. Jon Favreau the director and actor did a great job of bringing the character of Tony Stark and Iron Man to the big screen. The battle between Iron Man and Iron Monger at the end did feel a bit anti-climatic and a bit rushed but fortunately the good more than outweighs the films tiny flaws.

However, the film is not brilliant or that great because of some flaws. Before this movie, I had liked Downey Jr. but became a fan of him by this movie. Iron Man could be seen just for him and the character h created in this movie! Jeff Bridges's acting is great and despite he is not an interesting or bad-ass villain (he is a businessman) he is the second star of the movie and he is memorable. He is a cliché character a little bit (a black-hearted and hard-nosed capitalist), but Bridges makes him pretty deep and realistic. There are a few logical goofs and it seriously disturbed me. For example, while trying his new Iron Man equipment, he hits to the ceiling very badly. No one can stand against such a strike or the scene which he falls to the ground from miles, it causes person to die or at least heavily injured. As said, The movie is highly entertaining from the first minute till the last, as for action, there are not tons of action unfortunately, it can't change the fact that this is an action film. Especially, the scene that he tries to save a group of people and the jet scene were so well done. The climax fight of the movie was a bit short and far from being unforgettable, but a solid one. Final fights are generally waited with high expectations and mostly only a few of those meet the expectations. In terms of political background, the origins of some bad guys or the very American tone annoyed me, but I didn't mind much. By the way, there is a brilliant thing about this movie; the relationship between Tony Stark and Pepper Potts is different from all the same kind of movies here. It was twisty.

I know nothing of the comic book origins or how faithful this movie is to it, nor do I really care - fact is making interesting villains helps to separate good and great movies, and the writing isn't there for these villains. (spoiler) Jeff Bridges is a fun actor to watch, but doesn't quite have substance here, and when are writers and people going to stop with the continual poor cliché of Middle Eastern Terrorists....stick to corrupt drug lords at least as a better cliché instead of following the mindless propaganda. Also the romance is pretty much an afterthought. Gweyneth Paltrow is completely uninvolving and maybe miscast. But the effects and lavishness are wonderful to behold - as if capturing the spirit of a teenager who gets to work on his own sports-car. There is some good, light humor along the way. So, I'd recommend Ironman although maybe not glowingly which is a lot better than a lot of movies these days...it make it above the mixed category into solid and worthy despite some of it's lackings.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

","You know, I'm sick and tired of big budget movies. They are all empty, shallow, vacuous excuses for entertainment, that are not worthy of our attention or money. That's what I was starting to think then, as if by inverse force of will, along comes a movie like Iron Man. Downey Jr. plays Howard Stark, a man blessed since childhood with the ability to 'engineer', to fashion the extraordinary from the seemingly ordinary. As the spiel near the start of the movie goes, at the age of 4 he built his first circuit board, at the age of 12 he built his first, erm, jet engine? Can't quite remember, but you get the idea: He was the sort of precocious young upstart who deserves nothing short of a damn good cuffing. Whilst showcasing his companies latest invention, the Jericho project, a weapons system designed, literally, to shock and awe an enemy into submission, he is kidnapped by a bunch of shady Arab sorts – apparently it is now OK to assume that all people of Middle Eastern extraction are somehow involved in terrorism. Asked to build his Jericho system for them, he suddenly sees the light, and determines that his company will no more be involved in the manufacture of weapons – a claim that does not sit well with his 2nd in command, Jeff Bridges hamming it up marvellously. Inevitably, as hostilities mount, a showdown looms and, ultimately, a huge CGI battle with robots hitting each other very hard kicks in. But here's the thing: Unlike that other movie of recent times that involved robots pounding the living Jesus out of one another, this is a fine film, as opposed to one of the worst movies in existence. Downey Jr. is all simmering good looks and oddball mannerisms, whilst the story ticks along at a fair old clip. The movie is plot-driven, not effects driven and whilst there is the aforementioned CGI-fest towards the end, it doesn't feel forced, more a natural progression of the plot line. With an Iron Man 2 already in post-production and an Iron Man 3 rumoured already (has the world gone completely mad?), what could have seemed an odd choice for comic book to movie conversion now simply seems inspired.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

","Man, did I feel popcorn entertainment at the pinnacle point of 2008 when my adrenaline was running sky high as I was watching the superhero film extraordinaire ""Iron Man"". Robert Downey Jr. stars as Tony Stark, a billionaire weapons-manufacturer who gets captured by Middle Easterns who hold him captive in an Afghanistan prison cave. Stark uses his weaponry intellect, charismatic persona, and creative ingenuity in creating and becoming Iron Man to plan the Great Escape; eventually Stark sparks up Iron Man with precision robotics after his escapade. Sparks' assistant Pepper Potts is about the only female species who could probably tame the womanizing Tony. Let's just say that Iron Man had been pumping iron with the ladies even before Pepper sneezed in his life. Obadiah Stone is Sparks' shady business partner who might just turn out to be ""obadass"" villain of Iron Man. Jim Rhodes is the colonel pal of Tony who also moonlights as Sparks' public relations military ""rhodie"", sort-of-speak. I will not reveal more of Iron Man because I think you are going to have to iron out the facts and rough spots (if any) yourself by viewing ""Iron Man"". Director Jon Favreau, who starred in the indie classic ""Swingers"" and directed the hilarious ""Elf"", swings into blockbuster heaven big-time with his astonishing architecture of ""Iron Man"". Could be one of the premier directorial efforts of the year! Way to go Favs! Downey Jr. was the most ironic actor to play Sparks because Robert was used to living a fast ""shoot them up"" lifestyle (as Iron Man) in his real life when he fought a profound drug addiction problem back in the 90's; But just like Iron Man, Downey Jr. was able to get down from his high in the nick of time before facing the valley of death. Robert Downey Jr.'s heavy thespian work as Tony Sparks/Iron Man might just land him a Gold Man Best Actor nomination. Gwyneth Paltrow pushed her ""acting real good"" as the Pepper to her Sparks or otherwise known as Sparks & Pepper. In seriousness, it was Paltrow's best work in a decade. Jeff Bridges was ""metally"" tough as villainous steel as the greedy Obadiah Stone/Iron Monger. Terrence Howard, a great actor of our present generation, was adequate here as Colonel Rhodes but did not fire the same acting super missiles as Downey Jr., Paltrow, and Bridges. ""Iron Man"" was also a special effects spectacle and an art direction delight. So strike the iron while its hot (made $105 million on its opening weekend) and program yourself to the ""Iron Man"".

There are many things that makes this movie highly entertaining - the first, it must be said, was the amazing performance of Robert Downey Jr. as the main character 'Tony Stark'. He played the role of rich American playboy very well. The actual character Tony Stark was someone who I really empathized with I felt sorry for him as the movie progressed, for reasons I won't spoil here. As for the storyline, it's very engaging. For the most part, I found it realistic and believable. Tony Stark didn't have magic or super powers. For me, this was a refreshing change from the typical 'bitten-by-something-radioactive' story. Though I highly enjoyed this film, I found the beginning quite slow. Which brought down it's mark a little. It did take a little while for me to become immersed.

","Iron Man is a live action version of the comic book series featuring characters created by Stan Lee, Don Heck, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby. The film focuses on a rich weapons manufacturer named Tony Stark, who while on a business trip to Afghanistan, is kidnapped and forced to work on illegal weapons. With the help of a doctor who was also held captive, Tony eventually creatures a robotic body filled with different defence techniques and weapons, which he uses to escape and get back to America. Now back in America, and surviving a near fatal experience Tony, puts away his wild lifestyle and focuses on getting rid of weapons and making the world a safer place. Eventually, Tony has to put on the robotic suit once again to fight an evil co-worker and protect the city and world from weapons and evil. Lots of action and a build up to a probable sequel follow. Normally superhero action films aren't usually the kind of film that I pay much attention to, but within the last little while there have been some above average superhero films made and Iron Man, joins the team of successful ones. The film works on a large part because of Robert Downey Jr's top notch performance where at once he plays an arrogant and spoiled playboy to becoming a good hearted protector of things gone bad, so either way his snappy performance pulls it off quite well like it does in most of the films he stars in. The script the filmmakers have to work with is fairly intelligent and combines a look at the different characters in the film and much to my liking focuses more on them and has quite a good build up before it gets into action and special effects. More time is spent with the characters and how Tony, becomes Iron Man, and I much preferred this to a non stop special effects extravaganza. Even when there is action scenes they do the job of entertaining and don't go overboard by being too long, or too overblown by special effects, so that worked for me as well. While, I didn't think the supporting performances were quite as good as Downey's performance, they still held their own and for a film like this Oscar calibre performances aren't totally necessary even though what Downey pulls off is gold. I liked the pace of the film and thought it moved along quite well and for a film of this type I think the writers and filmmakers did a pretty good job of making something that could be loud, tedious and non stop with special effects into a more compelling and human story that combines the typical superhero movie elements, but does it well due to good timing, writing and direction.

(IRON MAN also boasts what is by far the funniest Stan Lee cameo appearance ever.) Like L. Frank Baum's Tin Woodsman, Tony Stark is in search of a heart- and he finds it. It's refreshing in a big budget fx fest to find a soft, chewy caramel center. Unfortunately, the producers of THE INCREDIBLE HULK (the latest version) weren't quite as capable of finding said center. Good, but by no means the achievement that IRON MAN is, THE INCREDIBLE HULK reminded me more than a little of the original SUPERMAN serial (with Kirk Alyn), wherein our hero literally transformed into a cartoon every time he took to the skies. (I don't recall that happening in the original CAPTAIN MARVEL serial, nor the ROCKET MAN serials.) By excising the bothersome human element, the producers of THE INCREDIBLE HULK have simply given us another cgi cartoon crowded with real folks who seem oddly out of place.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

The film then shifts off to the great special effects we have became so used to in action movies, yet the theme of the character transformation so dominates the film from the development of his body chest suit, to the making of his clicking limbs and flamethrower arms all rounded out perfect when he's topped off by a medieval knight mask to become ""Iron Man""! Stark/Iron Man fooled his captures by constructing a cluster bomb they demanded only he built a mechanical alter ego to fly to freedom!

Of course there's a villain, in this case it is the Dude himself, Jeff Bridges, but we do not care much, because in this movie the main villain is Tony Stark. And the hero, too.

","This is the best Marvel comic to movie made in my opinion topping even the venerable X- Men. What was so great was that it captures the essence of the Iron Man's world so well. I was a big fan of Iron Man comics when I was growing up. I especially liked Don Heck and Gene Colan days of Iron Man, and this story has rich innuendos from those days like the homage to the original gray Iron Man suit, to the gold version, and to the red and gold design. What I liked especially was that they didn't try to make this Iron Man ""dark"" to pretend that it was a serious drama, (but it was a good drama none the less) and captures the blazing opulence of Tony Stark's glamorous world and boost it a couple more notches. This is truly Iron Man at its best, and it was the neatest Marvel character come to life on screen. I'm little surprised that John Favreau who played Foggy Nelson on Daredevil was the director for this film. He did a great job, and so did all the casts on this movie. Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow were absolutely believable as Tony Stark, and Pepper Potts.

Big congrats to Favreau & co. for pulling this off. So which makes me wonder how incredible major properties such as Fantastic Four, Hulk & Captain America could have been with the right people on the projects. This movie was so good it's hard to even watch earlier superhero films because they will not be at the level this one is. The actors, especially Downey did a fantastic job and were believable in their roles. As Stark, he perfectly captured the self serving smart ass as well as the guy who redeems himself by using his weapons for good. The story & CGI were amazing especially the origin sequence & the unveiling of the final version of the Iron Man suit.

Usually I trust this site, but this is just bizarre. Even if I was the biggest flag waving Type A male chauvinist pig, I'm sorry, this movie would still suck. The plot is unbelievable from the get go. A military supply company founder/inventor is a celebrity that everybody knows and wants an autograph from? Ridiculous.

A man who made killing machines all his life suddenly decides to make a machine that's ""not a weapon?"" How is it not a weapon, and when did Stark have this epiphany that changed his entire outlook on life? Maybe I was rolling my eyes during that scene and missed it. A hard-hitting reporter suddenly decides to jump in the sack with Stark? Don't ask me, I'm just a girl! hee hee hee. Totally ludicrous and disrespectful to women. And why did Gwyneth's character need to be in this movie? Why did his friend and partner suddenly become a bad guy?

Because he brought a lot of comedy to the role, such humorous lines the great way Robert Downey Jr can deliver them so well.

","Billionaire arms manufacturer Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is kidnapped by terrorists during a visit to Afghanistan. Stark is held captive and is told by the terrorists to build them a missile. As he begins work, Stark sees first hand his legacy of death and destruction. What's funny is that just the day before Stark was rebuking claims of being a war profiteer by saying, ""As soon as weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace I'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals."" Let me come right out and say it. Iron Man may not be Marvel's most popular superhero, but he's officially my favorite. This film had the usual summer comedy and action but strangely enough, Robert Downey Jr. was able to bring a lot of soul to the role of Tony Stark. He's the hero with a heart, and considerably more dialogue than Peter Parker ever had in any of the Spider-Man movies. You see, back home Tony Stark was just another genius billionaire playboy (Bruce Wayne anyone?). His world consisted of his assistant Virginia ""Pepper"" Pots (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Colonel James ""Rhody"" Rhodes (Terrence Howard). After his return to the United States, he immediately shuts down the weapons manufacturing division of Stark Industries. I know you're thinking this is problematic. ""Didn't you say he was a weapons manufacturer?"" Yes, and that's what makes it problematic for Stark's board of directors headed by Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges). Stane ends up having his own agenda with Stark, but I'll save the rest of that for those of you who haven't seen the film yet (and if you haven't, stop reading and go watch it now!).",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

Unfortunately he's very restrained here and the performance itself isn't hugely interesting except compared to other superhero movies. He and Gwyneth Paltrow have a noticeable lack of chemistry, but I suppose that's part of the point?

398,26 August 2019,azeemnavarro,7," An amazing start for a not so amazing universe
","In a personal quest of giving the MCU a second chance to prove me that is not as awful as I think it is, I will rewatch every movie up to Endgame, so we have to start with Iron Man. And yeah this is exactly what I remembered it was: a fun superhero movie that actually knows what to do.
With Iron Man, Marvel found a formula that worked, and that unfortunately they have squeeze for 10 years that every ""origin"" movie they make is just a remake of Iron Man. And I get why they do this. Iron Man works because it plays safe. We get a simple history, the typical hero's journey, ad what better if the hero we're talking about is Iron Man. Who knew who Iron Man was back in 2008? Just comic book readers like me, if you asked people if they knew Iron Man, they would've probably ask if you we're talking about the Black Sabbath song. Robert Downey Jr., a faded star that had some very serious addiction problems (ironically, just like the character itself), was gifted to play Iron Man. The man was born to play Tony Stark, yeah he's a great actor, but if you think about him, this role will pop in your mind instantly. He does a wondeful job at playing the childish CEO that eventually transforms in the hero.
But enough praise for Downey Jr., there are other things to talk about. The rest of the casting does a great job, except for one color dude no one remembers. An unrecognizable Jeff Bridges is the villain, and while the character itself is weak and we don't get so much explanation at why he's bad, Bridges still does a good job. Gwyneth Paltrow was also perfect casted as Pepper, she is in every Iron Man film a great support character, and her relationship with Tony Stark here is charming.
Why everyone went to the cinema when this was released was part thankful to that red and yellow suit. I have to say that the CGI of this film back in the day was impresive, but it hasn't aged that well, especially at the fight at the end with the villain. Still, is not annoying or anything like that, but is quite distracting.
So yeah, I have to say that Iron Man, while flawed, was a perfect start for the MCU, that after this one, has released more than 20 movies, few of them reach the quality of this first instalment, but all that succes is thanks to a playboy we all love.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

","In 1984, when I was 9 and living in Texas somewhere, my Dad asked what I wanted for my birthday. We where pretty poor and I knew it, but I had seen these kids reading comics at school and I wanted to know what the deal was. So I told him I wanted some comic books and he seemed relieved because back then they where only like 40 cents to a dollar. So he took me to the nearest 7-11 and my eyes almost immediately locked on to 2 titles, Teen Age Mutant Ninja Turtles #1 and Iron Man #180. The TMNT license never panned out to what I wanted. Other than the comics themselves, I was subjected to wave after wave of shittastic cartoons and half-witted movies. While, IM did have some cartoon exposure over the years, it was just never that good. I also knew that the cinematic technology of the time would not lend itself well to a live action IM movie. So I waited. Patiently. Watching the progression of CGI and costumes and feeling conflicted on what medium I wanted to see my my favorite superhero portrayed in. I'll admit, I'm a fan of CGI and had been hoping for an IM movie in the vein of the Final Fantasy or Appleseed style animations. So, when I herd that IM was going to be live-action, I was worried to say the least I was shockingly and joyfully surprised to have my worries dashed against my doubt. At the risk of sounding like a mewling fanboy, I have to say this is the best superhero movie I have ever seen. Almost 25 years I have been waiting for an Iron Man movie. Now that it has arrived, I could not be happier. There where legions of nay-sayers when RDJ was announced as Tony Stark. I was not one of them. He was a great choice and he somehow managed to tap into my imagination and deliver the performance I was hoping for. The witty, over the top confident, sarcastic pimp that I prayed to Kirby for was delivered in full. John Favreau, an admitted fan or IM, did the license justice with out going over the top in character expression or over stuffing the plot. The acting complemented the writing in a manner not expected from most movies of this sort. Well, not by me anyway. The Three Headed Monster of Stan Winston, ILM and Sky Walker Sound kicked the living guts out of anything I have seen previous to this movie. Not once did I get that CGI lag or clunky costume feeling. They blended the live-action and CGI very well and I truly believed. A+ to Iron Man and all involved.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

","Spider-Man was great, the first Hulk wasn't, and the Fantastic Four did okay, and then came this film with Marvel creating their own film studio to complete their piece, from director Jon Favreau (Elf). Basically Tony Stark (National Movie Award nominated Robert Downey Jr.) is the successful and rich head of Stark Industries, who manufacture weapons all over the world, and his life is changed when he is badly wounded in the chest. Tony is saved by a special metal based plate in his chest that keeps the shrapnel from reaching his heart, but he is also forced to create a new weapon by his Middle Eastern captors. In the time he has to build this weapon, he instead creates a metal armoured suit to make his escape and attack all in his way, and he manages it. When Tony returns to the US, he announces that from his experiences, he realises his company is not doing good making weapons, and he starts making modifications to his armour suit design. While Tony changes the design, manufacturing it with gold and titanium, and adding a jet-propulsion system to fly, his second in charge Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) is still selling weapons to the Middle East. While in Afganistan, Stane comes face to face with Tony's original metal suit, and decides that it the new unknown ""Iron Man"" in the city, to go up against him. In the end, after defeating Stane, and against the advice of his crush-driven personal secretary Virginia 'Pepper' Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), Tony announces to America and the world that he is Iron Man. Also starring Terrence Howard as Rhodey, Leslie Bibb as Christine Everhart, Shaun Toub as Yinsen, Faran Tahir as Raza, Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson, Bill Smitrovich as General Gabriel, Paul Bettany as Jarvis and look out for Stan Lee as the man in the smoking jacket. Downey Jr. has been away as a leading star for a while, and this is a fantastic return for him, and he has great support from a reliable Paltrow, and a mean performance from Bridges. There is good action and adventure, there are great special effects coupled with cool gadgets, and a quite engaging story to carry you along, it is a great fantasy superhero movie. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the National Movie Award for Best Superhero.

In my opinion this is the first successful marvel super hero adaptation to date.The Story has been adapted for the modern times which was a good move in my opinion(In the original story tony stark became iron man during the Vietnam war although later they pushed this moment forward to the golf war.) The plot is good,the GCI is acceptable( the suit is amazing),it has several well made action scenes and as the movie goes on you become even more interested.But the greatest thing about Iron Man is no doubt the choice of Robert Downey Jr to play tony stark and the way producers approached this character. He is a player,he drinks,he smokes, he is a political incorrect smart-ass who wants to live life to the fullest.Just my kind of Hero. And taking into consideration Robert Downey Jr past, you realize that that no one could have done it better. He truly was a bit of tony stark in the past and he excels in this role.

","Iron Man was an okay movie. I went twice, and I'm thinking about going in for a third viewing. But I'm sorta disappointed, because I am a comics collector and I know how great a potential the character has. What we were given here - and I might be able to forgive Hollywood for it, but Marvel Studios? - was a movie where the acting worked very well, and things looked good, but the plot and story were mediocre at best. The origin story was too long and not ""important"" enough - I mean, why would this terrorist guy make Tony Stark build him a Jericho missile when he already had several of them (we *see him using them* later in the movie)? Just to get one more? And that's the whole setting for the situation that creates Iron Man? I'm sorry, but that's effin' thin. No points for cleverness there. The visual effects were very good, but I say again that the story was too thin. Too many scenes were too predictable, incl. much of the end. And though the acting was good, the characters had little depth, especially Stane. It's cool enough that they used the Iron Monger story from Iron Man #200 (which came out in 1985 and was the culmination of a long story arc), but it would have been much cooler if they'd introduced Stane as Stark's partner and waited until the second or third movie to have him come out of the closet as a villain. And now that terrorist guy (who's supposed to be The Mandarin, Iron Man's arch-nemesis) is apparently going to build an army of Iron Men, or something like that, for the next movie, making the villains in that one armored as well. Can we please stop filling up Iron Man movies with Iron Man knock-offs? God knows there're enough of them in the comics.

","I went to go see Iron Man on my day off , although being a huge fan of Marvel comics in general I was not really a huge fan of Iron Man but the movie was worth a check out. Robert Downy Jr was brilliant as Tony Stark , he actually reminded me of Nic Cages take on Johnny Blaze / Ghostrider . The good thing about the movie was that it tried to be entertaining and not too political which at one point became my fear in the movie. The special affects and the awesome action are what stop this movie from its storyline which although deals with Morley the birth of a hero and a little a less on the movie rolling along side , but because Robert Downy Jr was just so hilarious as Iron Man I was just willing to let that go. To sum it up Iron Man might not be the biggest or the best comic-to-big-screen action movie , it certainly lives up to it advertising and delivers and entertaining flick which is worth a look at and I certainly would not mind checking out a sequel to it.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

And he should not only lead the ""Iron Man"" franchise, but quickly afterward also become the new ""Sherlock Holmes"" and certainly a superior one to Benedict Cumberbatch. But lets get back to this film we have here. It received great audience numbers and critics reviews and was one of the main reasons why superhero films are so much en vogue again. But it's not all Downey Jr.'s achievement.

Donney has been famous for giving noisy and ""rap"" performances in many charming characters. This time he definitely did it again. While the audiences are being convinced by the conversion from a play boy to a super hero, which is tuned down by the makers, the movie just kept teasing everyone's eyeballs with exciting actions and a sense of ""Donney"" humor.

464,2 May 2010,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,8," Yes, you are Iron Man
","This is a review of the Ultimate 2-Disc Edition DVD of the film, which comes with 3 hours and 12 minutes of interesting, informative and really well-done featurettes/interviews, 24 minutes of extended/deleted scenes(not completely done as far as I can tell; some of them make Tony an even luckier bastard than he was in the final cut), a 3 minute The Onion spoof, a one minute commercial, and last but not least, a *ton* of galleries. I watched this at the cinema two years ago, and since purchased it, and freshened up my memory of it tonight because I'm going to see the second one tomorrow. It was nice to find out that so much of the time, the suits(that look *glorious*, by the way, designs are spot-on, and they sound and move exactly right, too) are really there; this was the last thing Stan Winston completed... R.I.P., you will not be forgotten. The photo-realistic, beautiful, convincing and appropriately used CGI closes the gap, so that you cannot tell where it goes from one to the other. I should say that I am not technically a fan of this hero, but I do like him, and enjoy reading comics that he's in, including the ones centered on him. Based on what I do know of him, this largely nails the source material. This makes incredible use of different styles of editing, and practically redefines the term ""effective reveal"". Few origin story flicks are this entertaining. The plot is good, and well-told. Pacing is just excellent, from start to finish. It's mainly fast; however, it does allow for breathers, without ever slowing down enough that it'll lose your devoted attention. The writing is just so fantastic throughout, in fact, the few things I knew beforehand or figured out before they occurred, worked. And the comedy... I'm not kidding, everyone in this, *the AI*, has a sense of humor. Jokes and gags are everywhere in this, and somehow it still manages to be serious(not to mention that they are all funny, timing, delivery, perfect). Emotion is garnered, without slipping, for a single second, into actual sentimentality or sap. Tension is also built, expertly so. It has been said that as far as the dialog, Jon allowed for improvisation... so I don't know how much of the stuff was on the page, and how much the performers came up with, but whatever exactly took place, they had the recipe for total success. I couldn't think of a bad line(or one that didn't come off as natural) found in this no matter how bad I wanted to(I have tried, I try to dispense a healthy amount of criticism upon everything I watch). The acting is flawless(and let's be honest, Downey Jr. is *the* choice for the role; and he does as many of his own stunts as they let him). This is probably the first and thus far only case where I've particularly cared for what Paltrow gave in a piece. There is a lot of realism herein, so those prone to shying away from stuff like this are likely to have a wonderful time. The music is amazing, and fits impeccably well. All of the action is awesome, plain and simple; perhaps there could be a greater amount(though, again, there isn't a boring moment to be found in this). Please do *not* be scared off by the PG-13 rating... to provide an example of how cool it can be in spite of that, think of Hellboy.

The movie's naive take on war seems to be that the problem is weapons makers and (middle eastern) warlords, as opposed to say, imperialism, greed or, more to the point, the knee jerk use of force to solve all problems. Like the movie itself, Stark has a surface revelation but can't or won't look at the deeper issues.

What Iron Man can't provide is due to its very nature - the everyman, common man perspective, a level that the mass audience can identify with as with the Spiderman franchise as well as the more personal relational boy-girl conflict. While Iron Man is truly intellectual with a conscience, that is what it remains whereas Spiderman focuses on the universal experience of all of us. Additional, unnecessary flashback sequence like with Batman Begins (2005) or even the more contemporary movie such as Made of Honor (2008) allows for the underdevelopment of the familial relationships important to the movie.

Six months ago, I couldn't be less interested in big-budget glory fests. I judged the movies I saw in theatres  movies like No Country for Old Men, There Will Be Blood, and Atonement  with the sharpest of critical eyes; the slightest detail out of place would have thrown me off completely. But now, in the upcoming summer months and eagerly awaiting releases such as Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian and The Dark Knight, my eye is different. I see a movie like Iron Man and don't care that it is almost entirely disconnected from anything remotely realistic. I don't care that it portrays Afghani terrorists as caricatures operating in backwater, undeveloped, ridiculously improbable cave networks. I don't care that there is a character named Pepper Potts.

There were a lot of adult themes that I think would be hard for younger kids to sit through, and lots of stretches without action. There are scenes of womanizing, some graphic war violence, and corporate politics, which I thought would either bore or be a little graphic for preschoolers.

I won't be explicit because I don't want to check the spoiler warning. Children over 10 should be OK, but at the showing I attended there were children much younger than that. Unfortunately, many parents are going to think their 5 year old may enjoy it because it's ""just a comic book movie"" without realizing that comics today aren't their Grandparent's comics.

","First I just want to say that if anyone did not like this movie, or was not appeased, they are just little whinny babies that think comic book movies should just be all about the comic books. This movie was absolutely excellent. Just simply excellent in just about every way. When I first saw the preview I really did think that it just going to be a geek flying around in a suite. But this was not just the case. Although, I did not read the comic books, I have to say that, this was indeed an excellent comic book movie, and one the best that I have seen. It has excellent special effects, excellent character development, some humor along the way, and fallows a great flow. Our hero know as Iron Man does not start off as a hero, instead he designs his suite over and over again to test it out, and then final takes action. He learns how his design works, and how to use it as well. I have to say that this film kicks the a** out of Spider-Man 3. Although, I did enjoy Spider-Man 3, but Iron Man is so fantastically put together that it kicks the F****** A** of Spider-Man 3. If you did not enjoy Spider-Man 3, you should enjoy Iron Man. This films sets the mode for the start of a great summer of comic book fans and comic book movie fans. Go see it, go see it. It was worth the money.

","Superhero origin stories were only known to comic fans except for a few like Superman or Batman, whose origins were told multiple times in different media. Iron Man's origin story was told in a more nuanced manner that it also became iconic nowadays. The story itself was also great because it took it's time in establishing the character of Tony Stark. The film focused on his character origins and development which made the movie itself worth investing in. Considering that the character continued to appear throughout the MCU with such an interesting appeal is a testament to the strength of the character and Dowey's portrayal. Speaking of portrayal, all the actors gave great performances. Jeff Bridges as the villain was frightening. The choice for him to play the Iron Monger was a good call because he was able to stand side by side against Downey. Gwyneth Paltrow also gave a lasting impression in her portrayal of Pepper Potts that she has also become a staple in the MCU alongside Downey. Terrence Howard was also good in his portraying of Rodey. Indeed among the good things about the film were the sounds and the special effects. The background music was appropriate to the theme of the movie. There was a good implementation of rock music alongside scenes where Iron Man appeared. The music for intense action scenes were also nicely put. The special effects at that time definitely were not bad. The efforts put into making the Iron Man armor realistic were well worth it. Not only did the special effects team make Iron Man look cooler from his comics counterpart, but they also made him iconic. The overall feel of the film was also one of its strengths. Unlike the other films in the MCU, Iron Man is grounded. It does not have any sci-fi or fantasy elements mixed into it. The movie felt that, while fictional, it happened in a real world setting. The technology, the location, the people, even certain situations involving war were all relatable because they are happening in reality (well except for the Iron Man technology of course).

","I'm probably getting old, but Speed Racer tired me and somewhere in the middle of Iron Man I found it a bit slow. Either that or I experience burnout from wallowing in the pre-release internet publicity of both movies. Some people are saying that this Iron Man is better than Batman Begins. Yes, in one aspect, I think Robert Downey is a better actor than Bale. They are both quite good, but I give more points to Downey for being self-deprecating and funnier, plus, his personal history outside the movie adds to the baggage (actual positive baggage!) he brings to this role. Very inspired acting, aside from the fact he's quite qualified to do the role anyway. I do prefer the basic story of Batman over Iron Man. A Batman story relies on atmospherics (hence the use of a bat, and the generally dark tone of most of movies and comics). He also uses a bit of deductive reasoning in combating crime. Tony Stark is an inventor, and his suit is a wonderful toy, but Iron Man's antagonists aren't that inspired (except maybe the Mandarin). The comic's best story arc are Stark battling his personal demons. I like the way Favreau makes his fanboy homages so integrated to the movie. Not being aware of them won't detract a whit from a newcomer's experience, but knowing about them will send a fanboy to nirvana. In any case, exemplary work. My rating of an 8 may seem too low for a positive review, but I'm a bit of a contrarian.

","After the disastrously disappointing summer special effects extravaganza ""Transformers"" (2007), ""Iron Man"" was just the kind of movie to boost up my anticipations again for the big-budget action blockbusters. This was the sort of movie that ""Transformers"" should have been: action-packed, witty, intelligent, character-populated, plot-backed, and above all, fun. Whereas ""Transformers"" had me yawning thirty minutes in with its awful dialogue, two-dimensional characters, and lack of awe-inspiring moments from otherwise visionary special effects, ""Iron Man"" had me interested right from the start, mostly due to the stellar performance by Robert Downey, Jr. and although I felt the climax was a little less climactic than it should have been, the movie pulled itself through clear to the end.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

Any movie that has AC/DC playing inside the first five or ten minutes is a winner for me.

","I was never particularly interested in Iron Man. No special reason, just didn't get the chance to read any of these comics and the character didn't appeal to me that much. Nevertheless, I watched this film expecting to be somehow enlightened about the (possible) dark origins of The Iron Man, and getting a bit of action. The result of my curiosity has been utter disinterest and disgust. Iron Man tells the story of Tony Starks, a weapon dealer, a playboy, a care-free guy with an over-sized ego. After getting kidnapped by a Middle East guerrilla in order to get him to build one of his hi-tech missiles, Tony is able to build a prototype of the exo-suit Iron Man IN A CAVE, FROM SCRATCH, AND BEING Continuously MONITORED BY HIS CAPTORS. That's right, he does this without these Middle East army people suspecting much. Don't ask me how though. The plot continues with more nonsense and your typical bigger than life ego show. Don't expect any war within Tony ala Batman while he struggles with a dark past or something similar. Tony Starks seems to be a shallow human being who loves himself, end of the story. I cannot help but wonder if the people reviewing this film before me actually watched the same flick. ""A flawed character that becomes honorable""? He doesn't change much through the film. ""Well-delivered script and sufficient plot-twists to keep you engaged""? Honestly, any Gardfiel episode has a much better script and twists. I also read that this won't disappoint Iron Man comic fans. I can only wish that the comics are actually better than this. Otherwise, I pity anybody attached to the misadventures of this fictional individual which biggest concern in life is to spit out a joke every time he opens his mouth.

He wakes up in a cave within the mountains, and immediately the terrorists demand that he build them his new weapon. It is then that he realizes that his weapons are being used by not only the military, but terrorists as well. As weeks go by, instead of building a missile, Tony Stark builds an armor suit equipped with weapons. He escapes using the suit, destroys the camp, and is soon rescued by his friend Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard), and brought back home. As soon as he's home, Tony decides that his industry will no longer make weapons. And he begins to work on a new, flashier red/gold version of his suit, and a more flyable one at that. Tony Stark realizes that he should protect the people he's put in harm's way, and does just that with his new suit under the name Iron Man. However a new foe faces Tony in his own business partner Obadiah Stone (Jeff Bridges).

","Iron Man was one of the first super heroes that Stan Lee came up in the early sixties. He also was one of the original Avengers, Marvel's answer to DC's Justice League which of itself updated version of the Justice Society that began in the forties. He never was a particular favorite of mine. He seemed too much like a robot. In that, his suit contained all the super powers he could have. His alter ego, Tony Stark, stripped of his suit, had no super powers of his own except for his genius for making such a suit. With a weakened heart, he couldn't even be match for his counterpart in DC, Bruce Wayne. a.k.a. Batman. There's actually a precursor of Iron Man in cinema though in comics, he came first. That precursor was RoboCap, a supercop who became for robot than man. In fact, there's a least two scenes that directly the earlier superhero but done differently enough. John Favreau has made successes in making comedies. He does show a great comedic touch is directing the script written by Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, the later who's from India, assuring the Aghanistan are treated as people and their plight of villagers shown. But it's the casting that really works here. Robert Downey, Jr., plays Tony Stark as a spoiled playboy millionaire who's able to deadpan the most chauvinistic lines with a straight face. Gyneth Paltrow is also very good as Pepper Potts (what a name!) who plays his assistant, which includes taking out the trash, meaning some beautiful woman that Stark beds then instantly forgets. Actually, why she would any interest in him at all is a problem with the script, not her performance as she does come across as very smart even when she's playing the damsel in distress. The main antagonist is played by Jeff Bridges, who's obviously enjoying himself and even looking a bit like Bruce Willis with his shaved head and goatee. The BBF (Black Best Friend) falls on Terrance Howard's shoulders who at one point sees an outfit and says to himself ""Not this time."" Well, there's no secret as of this writing that there is going to be an Iron Man 2. What was really unexpected was if one said a few years ago that Downey would helm one of the best super heros made, that would have seemed impossible. He has the rare quality to be likable when he's doing the most rude things. How he ends the movie almost makes one stand up and cheer. The movie also gives an interesting question. Can peace be achieved by using the military correctly? As this is 2008, creating war weapons is big business and that is actually the business Tony Stark is in to make his billions. Will he find the heart to do what's right? To even have such a question come up is not bad for a comic book movie.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

Then he basically reforms his ways and decides not to make weapons for evil anymore. He's betrayed by someone in his company twice and has to defeat him even though the guy used his own technology and made his own suit. He had help from his assistant Pepper and was able to get it done.

661,22 March 2021,hoernkeem,9," Iron Man review (2008, Jon Favreau) The MCU commences in wonderful style!
","Iron Man (2008, Jon Favreau)
Looking back writing this review in late 2020 it is hard to quantify the achievement of Marvel Studios and Kevin Feigie, producer extraordinaire, in specific. There had been comic book films before, but nothing prepared us for the journey we were about to launch into: The MCU. 23 interconnected films featuring super heroes and teams of Marvel comic book fame and, in some cases obscurity, culminating in the two part Avengers Infinity War films that would shatter box office records around the world. The entire enterprise represents the high water mark for technical, innovative, creative, big budget studio storytelling, and it all started with 'Iron Man'. Marvel made very few missteps even at the outset which is part of why they were able to just put the foot on the gas and keep on motoring. It is funny too because in a year where such acclaim was heaped upon Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' 'Iron Man' may have felt like something of an afterthought, but it turned out to just be the tip of an insanely amazing iceberg.
Iron Man while a tried and true Marvel hero didn't immediately jump to the forefront of the brain as the hero which would lay the first brick in this wall. Robert Downy, Jr. perfectly embodies the man Tony Stark and the hero Iron Man. The casting all around is impeccable. That is another interesting key to Marvel's success is that they were able to hold onto so many of the same actors for all this time with little to no turnover. 'Iron Man' features one of the few prominent roles that would alter as initially Rhodey is played by Terence Howard but would be played by Don Cheadle in all subsequent outings. Gwyneth Paltrow excels as Pepper Potts as well as Jeff Bridges as Tony's business partner Obadiah Stane. The film is gorgeous to watch with Favreau's sequences looking absolutely stunning and they still look great going on 12 years later.
So like any good comic book film is apt to do if this is the first time we are seeing a character grace the silver screen we get a full fledged origin story. This begins with Tony Stark, rich, hyper intelligent, playboy billionaire and weapons manufacturer demonstrating a new missile system in Afghanistan. He gets caught in an ambush and almost dies before being saved by a captive local who is able to stave off Stark's death by rigging is body with an electromagnet in his chest. The terrorists who have him want Stark to build them a weapon and instead he builds himself a weapon. An iron suit which allows him to escape, but beyond that it gives him the idea for a sleeker more powerful, more eye catching iteration which will really allow him to flex some muscle and do some damage as Iron Man is born. He saw first hand in the middle east his weapons being misused and is now attempting to turn the direction of his company toward something a bit more benevolent much to the chagrin of Stane and his board of directors which leads to a classic confrontation of iron suited combatants. The whole thing is put together quite nicely and even though the running time exceeds two hours the fast paced narrative never feels like it lags.
While the need for an origin story is vital here in the MCU's infancy it also gives rise to perhaps the only flaw of the film. The film doesn't lack for action, however, there is only one real scene where we get Iron Man at full on 100% power and in ass kicking mode. Otherwise it is the suit in its archaic infancy or later on he is depowered. I remember leaving the film very much looking forward to a sequel so we could get some more action scenes with our hero at 100%. That being said the movie is so good that it is hard to complain about that small flaw although a bit more action in the suit would have been nice.
Ultimately this wonderful to watch and also lays a solid first step on the yellow brick road to the Emerald City that are the marquee Avengers films. They even lay the ground work for that here by having recurring character Colson show up as a SHIELD liaison. They also feature a revelatory end credit sequence for which these MCU movies would become famous. This one features Samuel L. Jackson's brief debut as Nick Fury approaching Tony Stark about the Avengers. Just like that we are on our way. I am not sure that even Feigie knew what he had at this stage, but it started what is arguably the greatest and most successful film franchise in history.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

It is REALLY FAR from being a good movie, and even more from being in the top 250 of the all-time best movies. This is my first comment on this site, and it is also the first time that IMDb deceived me on a movie... I was sure that it would be awesome but it was just stupid and pointless. Maybe it is because I am not a fan of the Iron Man comics but I couldn't get in it, from the beginning to the absurd end. I loved the other superhero's movies but the context of this one was just too ridiculous that it was not interesting at all...

","Generally I am quite a big fan of comic book movies, sure I've never read a comic book in my life and in truth I am not the best judge on the translation from page to screen. But I can tell a good movie, and I can safely say there are both brilliant comic book movies, X-Men 2, Spiderman 2, Batman Begins, and some downright awful comic book movies, Batman and Robin, Ghost Rider, Elektra. Iron Man isn't as well known to me, I knew of Batman, Spiderman, the X-Men mainly through the TV series, I never saw the cartoon of Iron Man and so knew very little of the origin story. I went in today expecting something decent, pretty much another Daredevil or Fantastic Four, good but strictly mediocre. Thankfully Iron Man was so much more, and the reason because of this was it actually focused on storyline and had a heart. Superhero movies nowadays have a tendency to rely on cool characters and nothing else, yes Ghost Rider I am looking firmly at you. Iron Man is different, while the character is great, the action sequences stunning and the special effects immaculate, the storyline and heart are there. Robert Downey Jr does miracles in the role of Tony Stark, being one of the most well rounded superhero characters I have ever seen. But the script does the performance justice. Iron Man is by far one of the better comic book movies I have seen and has left me desperate for an Iron Man 2.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

Downey, Jr. I could buy. The problem for me was the suspending of believability,I had a similar problem with the 2nd Indiana Jones Movie. I know it's fantasy, I know it's a comic book, but if you get out of the cartoon world at least try to have action that is somewhat believable. The whole sequence with him building that first Iron Man Suit in a cave ....Yeesh! Plus dropping 500 feet from the sky and getting up without a hair messed up just made me groan. The plot was shaky. Now, I didn't mind a little politics in there. Certainly the idea of our enemies getting hold of the weapons we build to defeat them is probably more true than we care to think about.That being said, I find it impossible to believe that the Jeff Bridges character (and he does give a great over-the-top performance)as the CEO of the world's biggest arms manufacturer would be zipping around 3rd world countries personally to oversee his black market arms sales and deal with petty warlords.

","Robert Downey Jr. is more than fitting as the rich, intelligent, swagger-man Tony Stark. Iron Man is just a suit, so Tony is just a person. He's not a superhero, he's a man thriving in decadence, an entrepreneur with personal gain. His business, Stark Industries, manufactures and sells weapons for war. It takes his kidnapping and subsequent three month imprisonment to realise the wrongs in his life. The suits helps him right his wrongs. Obadiah Stane, work partner and friend of Tony's Father, is against Tony's decisions. With his shiny, bald head, Bridges is a brooding, intimidating figure, taking some of that huge burden laid upon Downey to do so well. ",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

The story is pretty solid, though I am not a fan of the character, I do admire it from a filmmaking standpoint.

","Tony Stark, aka Ironman, is the hero of 2008. Or better stated, Robert Downey Jr. is Carrot Top, doing stand-up, in the comedy film classic of this summer. Mr. Downey takes off with an array of one liners, and simply does not quit. Along with his stand-up comedy, the sight gags add more support, to this burlesque, portrayed on screen. Without giving away too much of the plot of the film, a head strong Industrialist, goes into the thick of the current battle zone, to show off his most current weapon of defense, and blunders into the hands of the enemy. Ironman is born, and the film goes on, full tilt from there. Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) is one of the key board members of Stark Industries, and best friend of Tony Stark's late father. What is most interesting about the choice of Mr. Bridges in this film, is his past film credit, Tron (1982). A lot of the visual electronics, in Ironman, appear to pay tribute, to the early, light show effects, that were created for the film, Tron. Mr. Bridges may play his part a bit over the top, but that goes very well, with his outrageous ego and persona. Pepper Everhart (Gwyneth Paltrow) plays Tony Stark's quick witted, and almost sarcastic, first secretary. In fact, she is his only secretary, and true confidant. Their relationship aids the only true love element in the entire film, which brings a human quality, necessary to bring the script down to earth. Tony' s and Pepper's rapport leads straight into the basis of the material, which supports the real issues of the Ironman myth. The real story of Ironman is taken from the true-love lives of Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Shelley. Ironman is Frankenstein, reborn to suit the failed self-image of a man. Whenever man tries to create something greater than his own self-image, a monster is created. No one but the creator, sees the creation for what it is intended, all others see, is a monster!

It is clear that they are aiming to establish a new franchise with this film, and with their forthcoming Incredible Hulk, there is plenty of potential for the kind of crossovers and exploration of the 'Marvel universe' that has so far been confined to comics format, presumably due to cost implications and licensing restrictions.

","Over the past decade or so, the superhero movie genre has been a mixed bag of sorts. Ranging from the awful 'Spiderman 3' culminating in Christopher Nolan's gloriously brilliant Batman films. 'Iron Man' was released in the same summer as 'The Dark Knight' and while nobody (especially myself) expected it to succeed I am please to reveal that Jon Favreau has produced a fine film that achieves everything it should. For anyone not familiar with the plot of Iron Man (such as myself, having never seen the comic books), it revolves around Tony Stark, a military arms dealer building a robotic suit to combat the problems his previously designed weapons have caused. The narrative is quickly established and the suits origination is revealed from an early stage, however the film does take a while to get going and the action sequences don't kick in until much into the film. This is not to say that 'Iron man' is dull, in fact it is far from it. The script is quick and snappy, Robert Downey Jnr delivering his witty lines well and setting up a tensional relationship with his assistant Gwyneth Paltrow which becomes a vital subplot throughout. Comedy is also used to great effect here, always noticeable in a light-hearted superhero film but perhaps more evident here; the laughs churned out frequently keep the film moving at a fast tempo. When the action does begin though it does not disappoint, the special effects and explosions are magnificent and are in keeping with the grand scale of the film. The latter fight sequences are also a joy to behold, bearing quite a resemblance to 'Transformers'. More impressively, the performances of the actors are excellent. The aforementioned Robert Downey Jnr gets most of the gags, but nevertheless Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard all put in good performances.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

","Before Iron Man and the Marvel cinematic universe there had already been many great superhero films. Batman Begins, Superman 78 and Batman 89. Not so many had heard of Iron Man so this gave a fresh look on a hero for people who hadn't read too many comics. The formula is similar to previous ones. Our hero is almost killed, shades of Robocop and then kept alive. Shrapnel about to enter Tony Starks heart is prevented by new technology keeping him alive. Robert Downey Jr was a fantastic choice to play Tony Stark and kick off the age of comic book movies. It had some competition in The Dark Knight coming out the same year. Tony Stark finds himself in serious trouble and in somewhat desperation comes up with a new plan to protect himself from not only his own weapons, but also to stop them weapons falling into the wrong hands. A terrorist organisation want Tony's latest development the Jericho missile defence weapon and he becomes their hostage until he builds them an exact replica. Robert Downey Jr is perfect as Stark charismatic, intelligent, arrogant and at times childish. An addict to his work with the flaw of not seeing the dangers Stark industries could have on the world, if in the wrong hands. Once this reality comes to light he'll do anything necessary to protect the people of the United States. Jeff Bridges plays Tony's business partner Obadiah Stane and Gwyneth Paltrow is Pepper Potts his assistant. Both are compelling in their respective roles to support Downey Jr, but this is clearly a Downey Jr show. Rhodes is a close friend of Starks in the military and appears to work with Stark unofficially. Terrace Howard doesn't have the longest screen time but what he has is effective. The locations are intriguing and relevant to terrorist issues of our time. Afghanistan terrorist organisation want power of these weapons, the weak point of this movie would have to be the villains. Although weapons mean power and possession of them is everything. This is a comic book film after all and doesn't appear to have a memorable flamboyant villain to go with the well thoughtout heart felt story, of how Stark is willing to change for the good. He sees his company going in the wrong direction and embraces change!!! Iron Monger is standard really not enough screen time to make an impact.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

It also kickstarted the MCU in spectacular fashion, setting the ground-work for what was to come but also being great in its own right (something that 'cinematic universes' are forgetting to do now). It might not be the best film to come out of the MCU, but the fact that it is better than the majority of them is a real testament to its success. 8/10",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

","This film is just more formulaic propaganda of the type that seeks to demonize cultures other than industrialized (especially Arab or Persian), and which tries to pound into our heads, over-and-over, that the rich (in this case, Stark) are our friends.
I can not ignore nor accept this attempt at political/psychological manipulation, and contend that it is the rich (like Stark) who we need to protect ourselves from. The insinuation that money, and what money can afford, will protect the rich from those who do not value riches leaves me with a great deal of suspicion, and it is not hard to determine the cultural genesis of those who inspire and support movies like this.

","Series -whether they're TV, comic, books - have a problem when they get made for the big screen. You have a hero, you have a villain, you have the love interest, and in a series the hero wins, but never destroys the villain (and like wise, somewhere in the story, the villain usually has the hero in a life or death situation, that they can get out of). When moved to the silver screen, the rich back stories and free flowing nature of the characters that makes them so long running ends up truncated for mass appeal, usually involving some family member or work colleague (Tomb Raider, Mission Impossible, Charlies Angels, S.W.A.T.), rather than expanding on a story line from the original series. Ironman is no different. You have the man in the flying metal suit, you have the love interest, you have a bad guy to stop, all tied up with plenty of amazing CGI and a thumping soundtrack. It's definitely the Robert Downey Jr. show, and he plays the flamboyant Stark with flair.

","What can I say? My childhood favourite Marvel superhero gets a movie worthy of his name and is probably second only to Spiderman 2 as the best Marvel film yet. The offbeat, yet interesting casting of Downey Jr as Tony Stark - as offbeat as Kelsey Grammar as Beast - provides as character study that keeps you hooked through the expository scenes. Manchild Stark is sleazily likable enough and Downey conveys a jaded world-weary tone with his posture during the scene with the pole-dancing stewardesses. This is a man ripe for a fall and his scenes with the Afghans have all the urgency of an Oliver Stone movie. Yinsen is interestingly expanded upon from the Oriental original to an intriguing figure who gives Stark his heart back in more than one sense of the word. The original grey armour is plausibly rough-hewn and its nice to see Stark is a ruthless combattant who has no qualms about sending baddies off to a nasty end - how does that match with an Avengers oath. My one complaint is that there are few action scenes for shellhead. The story of how Stane develops his Iron Monger armour is a nice twist and Jeff Bridges - an unlikely choice for the main baddie - comes across as an intriguing variant on John Huston in Chinatown - outward bonhomie occasionally slipping to show the dangerously hollow man underneath. Gwynneth Paltrow has a gawky charm as the lovelorn but unappreciated Pepper Potts though I'm more of a Bethan Cabe man myself and the final clash with Stane is bog-standard - but roll on the sequels.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

","Iron Man may seem to the uninitiated as an unlikely choice to be a superhero of blockbuster status but for fans of Marvel comics in general it makes sense.

A great screenplay supported by an excellent cast is what carried this film into the realm of believability. A good amount of time was spent fleshing out Tony Stark, who for the most part, was not made to be a sympathetic character. He's arrogant, he doesn't take life seriously and he's got more money than he knows what to do with and yet in the end he has a change of heart and you'll wish you were him donning the suit. Now that's good writing. The writers and Jon Favreau try not to stick with minor details, technicalities and such from the comics, instead they paint in broad strokes using universal themes that are familiar throughout adventure stories.

","After years of licensing out its marquee characters to film studios to stave off bankruptcy, Marvel finally launched its own production house to build its own cinematic universe. With Spiderman and the X- Men off their table, they gambled by turning to b-list Avenger Iron Man to kick things off, and it paid off handsomely. Because numerous prior attempts at bringing Iron Man to the big screen had failed, they have a wide-open canvas on which to world-build. The story and screenplay are open-ended enough so as not to close off possibilities prematurely, yet not so generic as to rob it of its own life. The character of Tony Stark fits Robert Downey Jr. like a glove; he fully captures Stark's obsessiveness and bemused arrogance. Most of the other actors in Stark's world seem to calibrate themselves off Downey, with Gwyneth Paltrow, Jon Favreau (who also directed) and Terrence Howard doing a good job conveying a sense of how exhilarating and exhausting it is to be in his orbit. The villain of the piece isn't technically revealed until well into the running time, but only people who've never seen a comic book won't have guessed (if only from the character's improbably evil name) the identity. This isn't a flaw -- the film doesn't have anything riding on trying to trick or misdirect viewers, but the story is structured in a way that we get explicit information only as Stark discovers it, which is an effective technique for putting us in his camp. The action sequences are everything we could hope for from a multi-million dollar tent-pole film, well-designed and executed and well-integrated into the story. I had trouble with the idea that someone supposedly as brilliant and worldly as Stark would be so naive about the geopolitical realities involved in arms dealing -- this is the source of contradictions in Stark's character with which the film tries to grapple but never successfully comes to grips.

Jeff Bridges is Obadiah who is such a convincing villain who wants Stark Industries for himself and when the final battle comes he will be more amazing then before. Gwyneth Paltrow is pepper Potts and always will be and i cant think of anyone else who could play her. we had Clark Gregg play Agent Coulson who would set up SHIELD and he and other secondary characters did amazing and overall Iron man is one one my favorite MCU films and it will always be the start of it all.,/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

His counterpoint, Marcia Nasatir, is a Hollywood producer who doesn't always agree. They discuss the script, the acting, special effects and the genre.

","Iron Man... the ""first"" MCU film. This movie was a huge moment in history as the post credit scenes and the dialogue in it were game changers for movies and it had never been done to that degree or hype before to lead onto other films such as the avengers. Robert Downey Jr is fantastic as iron man, he plays the role so well with his charm and witty personality, such a likeable main character who goes through this philosophical journey as he sees first hand what he and his company are doing wrong, he has to change that and when he gets back home he decides to use his power to make it a better place and stop producing weapons even if it means a downfall in sales and collapse of the company. There's a lot of humanity and great dialogue in the movie which really makes you think and feel for Tony Stark, most of what changed him was just in a cave as he learns about the devastation that his weapons are causing. The movie feels very grounded too with the way it's presented and it helps by feeling like the real world and even gritty. As the MCU progressed it kind of lost that gritty feeling as Iron Man touched sensitive topics such as war and terrorism on a sensitive level and also dealt with violence as Iron Man killed people in this and so did everyone else in the movie, it added to the story and tragedy of war which it was trying to get across which was great.

From his time in the cave, to him trying to do the right thing, but then people calling him out, and showing him that there are other ways to do this. His sense of trying to take responsibility, and his feelings of being useless, and like he doesn't deserve the second chance he has is one of the most realistic depictions of a man with low self value.

Well, it didn't seem like that to me. In fact, it's a long time since I spent such an enjoyable 2 hours in a cinema. What carries this film along between the action scenes (spectacular and funny when they come) are the smart, snappy script - full of brilliant, laugh-out-loud one-liners - and the excellent performances. I even found Gwyneth Paltrow watchable, which is a bit of a first. Jeff Bridges, too, turns in his usual goods. But the star of the show is, of course, Robert Downey Jr. At first, I couldn't imagine him in the role of a superhero - but he carries it off brilliantly. I was reminded many times of his character in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. He plays it with that same blend of quirkiness and sass. After this, other superhero movies (Batman Begins aside) fade into the background. None of the bum-aching tedium of the Spiderman or X-Men franchises.

","-So as a comics fan I just had to see ""Iron Man"" the first day it came out. My father and I came an hour before the showing just to get decent seating. We were pretty excited. -The hype all started about a year ago when teaser posters of Iron Man's head starting popping up at all the cons. People started to get excited for the film, but hype caught fire when the first trailer for the film hit the internet. The trailer showcased a real, modern story and a character the people can relate to. -""Iron man"" is one of the top ten highest grossing films of all time. Is it due to the hype? Is it due to the massive marketing? Well, that certainly is a good part of it, but I don't feel that fully explains the film's success. -Something that I've repeatedly run across in ""Iron Man"" talkbacks on various forums is that fans seem to be calling the film the ""Batman Begins"" of the Marvel Universe. After watching the film I would have to agree with that. Unlike the Spider-Man and X-Men films (which are all good :)) the story takes place in the real world which I can guess makes it The Batman Begins of the Marvel Universe. -If you didn't already know, ""Iron Man"" covers the origin of the superhero. Tony Stark is presenting a demo of his new weaponry, the ""Jericho"", in Afghanistan. Eventually Stark is captured and taken hostage. For his life he must build another ""Jericho"" missile for the bad guys. Well, instead of building the missile he decides to make the pre-Iron Man suit to escape. -Something that deserves to be noted(and has been noted a lot already!)is the chemistry between Gweneth Paltrow and Robert Downey Junior. What a dynamic! And a good one too. Most movies have some of the most boring romances, however this one never seems to fall short of entertaining. -Now lets talk about Iron Man himself. Iron Man isn't exactly the most traditional superhero considering his day job is a weapons manufacturer. However that doesn't last forever. After his weapons are stolen by his captors, innocent civilians of Afghanistan are in danger and Tony Stark changes his ways. Robert Downey Junior shows such character development and is both heroic and humorous at the same time. -This is the most entertaining movie I have reviewed yet and is one of the greatest comic book films I have ever seen.

The CGI is really really good except for the tank scene which looks like a computer game. At one point tom cruise was meant to play Iron man as much as i respect the guy i don't think he could have pulled it off as well as Robert Downey Junior. I hope they make a sequel to this Amazing Film.,/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

","This is easily in my top 5 favorite CBM origin films. I did not see this or any MCU movie in theaters until Age of Ultron. But The suit-up scene is still amazing to this day. One of my favourite scenes is the start when we see the unpainted Mark 2 for the very first time. The pan up the suit to the helmet is wild. This is the movie which started it all in the MCU and it proved that you don't need a popular character to make a good superhero movie and before someone tries to correct me I'm asserting that I meant MAINSTREAM popular. Before anyone argues about his popularity in the comics. Back in 2007-2008, no one expected this movie to be great let alone do as well as it did at the box office. Hell, it grossed more than Batman Begins and Superman Returns. Give credit to whoever you want, but this movie would not have worked if they'd cast anyone other than Robert Downey, Jr. For the role and for that I thank Jon Favreau, who had to fight for RDJ's casting. 2008 was an epic year, with *Iron Man* and *The Dark Knight* coming to us in the same summer! Although tonally very different, they both accomplished so much for the superhero/comic book genre of films in that they legitimized the category by being a great film first and ""based on a comic book"" second. Robert Downey Jr. Is up there with Hugh Jackman and Chris Evans as pitch perfect casting, to the point where it is going to be extremely difficult for Marvel Studios to re-cast the character down the line if need be. ""*Tony Stark was able to build this, in a cave! ...with a box of scraps!*"" I also think Obadiah Stane is under-rated because he sort of falls into the familiar trope of 'evil version of hero rises to challenge said hero', but even though this becomes a bit of a common theme among origin films it is still the first film in the MCU and imo necessary for Tony Stark's character arc that he sees the destructive potential for his own creation (which is possibly why *Iron Man 2* is not as widely loved, because the main villain is pretty one dimensional and another version of Stark creations gone bad, despite the fact that it sets up make a god bleed in *Infinity War*).",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

","This movie should have been called Iron D**k Head because this character whose supposed to be a ""genius"" who designed weapons of mass destruction just thinks with his penis. This movie thrives on the theme of masculinity and machismo instincts. Furthermore the style at which it was made with all the cheesy dialog makes for some of the shallowest media productions since the NBC show LAS VEGAS. Honestly why do we feel the need to make hero's out of people like this. This Stark character is nothing more then a shallow 2 dimensional fool, who only wishes to buy the most expensive cars, f**k the ditsiest whores, get drunk on liquor daily, and making that dollar. And that's where the magic of the film lies it's because most of the people in the audience are just as shallow as he is. They too reminisce about these narcissistic fantasy's which is why they fail to see just how much associated with vice and self indulgent this character is. And most people are probably thinking ""so what's wrong with that"" well I'll tell you what's wrong wrong with. Even though this character supposedly undergoes ""personal changes"" in the movie people in real life who engage in the same life style will just likely continue in this decadence until eventually their cockiness over so many years of never taking time to reflect will leave their souls inert, and unreachable through all the sarcasm and ignorance. Another problem I have with this movie is the the stereotypes. I'm not talking about the portrayal of Muslims I'm talking about the person they chose to be the villain. Just like a Disney movie the main villain is always the ugliest evil looking guy. In the case of this movie it's the dudes with bald heads and menacing looks plastered on their faces. They might as well walk around with a sign saying ""I'm an evil mastermind."" One character even gets uglier as his more sinister motives are revealed. And why does it have to be so unrealistic. No modern day weapons designer has that advanced home technology; holographic grid screens (those things are really getting overused), artificial intelligence systems so advance they could addition for parts in the next terminator movie. And if that finale epic battle had really taken place in real life where Iron Man gets bashed around in the middle half by his bald headed evil rival in the other suit the other man would not be saying clique' lines to taunt him like ""You've made your father proud,... for a man would wanted to rid the would of weapons you've given it it's best one,... come on you can't beat me I'm stronger than you..."", in real life it would have been something more like, ""What, foo?,... you want some mo?,... come here mutha****er,... whatcha gonna do?,... yeah you better run,... p***y"", OK it doesn't have to be that crude but it doesn't have to be that lame either.

","You'd assume in a movie of this sort that it would be the action or the spectacle that makes the film and the characterization that feels tacked on. But oddly enough, it is quite the reverse. Robert Downey Jr.'s Stark explodes off the screen as a likable, well-rounded scoundrel who isn't merely a slime ball with an eventual (quite literal)change of heart: he is a sympathetic idealist throughout, even when he's at his hard-drinking, womanizing worst. Downey is extremely comfortable both with the drama and the comedy and I found myself believing in his character more than I've believed in any comic hero outside of Christian Bale's more stoic Bruce Wayne. Surprisingly good work comes out of Gwyneth Paltrow, who's Pepper Potts is the perfect combination of empowered and vulnerable. Terrence Howard is likable as the straight and narrow boy scout best friend and Jeff Bridges is fantastic as the sleaziest character in recent film history. Some say he's less believable as Tony's friend, but I found him just as enjoyable as a good guy as he ultimately became as an out and out villain. Outside of these performances, there is an effort to make a fully realized comic book world around Tony which succeeds quite admirably. The many references to Iron Man lore never feel tacked on or excessive. Now for the main gripe: the action sequences. Not only are they too few and far between, but those that we get seem extremely forced. They are all over before they can truly get the pulse pounding and there's a sense that what little appears is merely to keep the kids from stampeding out. Action scenes are in fact an art form and a necessary part of a film like this, so the lack of satisfying escapism can simply not be overlooked.

","I was pleasantly surprised by this film despite being very dubious going into it after seeing a ridiculous trailer. John Favreau has done a really good job of handling the material and bringing it all together in an entertaining way. The story flows nicely and there is a superb balance between story, character background and action scenes. The film has its weaknesses however and is flattered by its current rating at the time of writing (around 8) The characters lack any real depth and their personalities are not really developed.

","I'm not a Marvel comics reader and so, not that qualified to assess this ""superhero"" portrayal from comics onto the big screen which real Iron Man fans can do much better. However, I found this movie very entertaining and if you're into gadget-loving, sci-fi stuff, there's a lot of innovative stuff to learn. Some particular scenes like the deployment of Jericho missiles were a real visual delight. You don't want to miss the ""assembly line"" for its gadget-gizmo's delights where Tony Stark (a.k.a. the Iron Man, a billionaire arms manufacturer and Master Designer) designs the robot-prototype armor (which is the central theme of this movie). Basically, the armor is a one-man army like never seen before; impenetrable to bullets, missiles and bombs - the armor is a heavy suit made of gold-titanium alloy (there was another one designed in an Afghanistan cave which falls into the hands of Obadiah Stane, Stark's business partner and main villain in the plot). The climax scene where Stark needs to deactivate a gadget called the arc reactor from Stane's chest is not clear in its outcome(it's supposed to be an inexhaustible source of free energy, Palladium-315 being identified as the fuel). Some scenes had loose ends e.g.the journalist called Christine Everhart from Vanity fair, with whom Tony has a one-night stand, her character wasn't developed but is important. Pepper Potts (played by the beautiful Gwyneth Paltrow) is shown as a loyal and dependable secretary who turns out to love her Boss (even though he's womanizing).

That his troubled past contributed to the portrayal of this conflicted super hero is obvious. His face and dark gaze emote more than just some pompous actor putting on a suit. The humor and intelligence behind IronMan was a result of his collaboration with the director. Perfect: Love him, loved the movie - - although I agree it got very ""Transformers"" near the end.

Ant-Man did it Dr. Strange did it Incredible Hulk did it even Iron Man 2 did it again. Jeff Bridges does a fine job with what he was given and is a decent villain. Robert Downey Jr however is a conceited greedy hog or rather a ham. Downey even screwed over Rhodes Tony Starks friend in an ironic twist proving the actor behind Iron Man is nothing like his superhero character. The movie does feel forced because it was written by an aging bloated hack director who did an even worse job of adapting Daredevil for the silver screen. Now the movie is overall decent the dialogue scenes and characters work well together and form a decent cohesive story. The origin as previously stated is well written and teaches its hero a valuable a lesson and gives him a well conceived arc. The villain is interesting but at the end is underutilized and they mindlessly just kill him off with no hesitation even though he was previously a close friend of the so called hero. The comedy feels very much out of place Iron Man is not a comedic quipping hero like Spider-Man. Iron Man is also robbed of all his human flaws like alcoholism from the comics he's not a very deep three dimensional character just an arrogant billionaire who becomes a slightly less arrogant billionaire by the end. He is driven by a desire to do good but I feel his arc is only half realized, because by the end he's still a blowhard and thinks himself above everyone.

1099,11 May 2008,Shinzons,6," An overrated movie that is somewhat of a mess, and fails to entertain.
","Iron Man is a movie that had some good ideas, but failed to realize them. Here's the bad: The pacing of the movie was rather poor. Rather than presenting its events in a fashion in which they build upon each other, therefore building the movie up like a great structure, it rather mixes things around, spending more time on small things than on the big things, making it seem kind of uneven, sort of misformed. Too much time is spent on building the suit. The CGI, for some reason, seeing as how this has the potential to make so much money, is mediocre at the very best. It is really obvious that what your seeing has been made by a computer. The movie is only 126 minutes long, but feels much longer. There isn't enough action. There's three scenes of action, his battle against the terrorists, the skirmish with the jets, and the battle against the Iron Monger at the end. These scenes feel much too short when compared to the non-action scenes, and i know, you have to spend time on the characters, but this movie spends way too much time on its characters, and that time isn't well spent. The action isn't well crafted, isn't designed well to be that thrilling, and there-for isn't. There is also a very clear potential for greatness with Tony Stark and a character named Yessin in the beginning, a very clear potential for some entertaining and well done character development, but what could have been great was muddled by some less than great writing and pacing. The acting was good, but did suffer in some parts, and wasn't some landmark as people have claimed. Bottom line, Iron Man, i don't think, is very good, because it doesn't have any parts that would make me want to watch again. Cloverfield has the same Re-watch inefficieny, but it was actually well done, and much more memorable. I gave Iron Man a 6 because it isn't terrible, but very, very mediocre. I don't understand, at all, all of the praise going towards it,especially all the critical praise. I wouldn't see it again, simply because the entertainment wouldn't be there.

1136,9 April 2020,frostyfrog,8," Iron Man
","Iron Man is a film directed by Jon Favreau that stars Robert Downey Jr, Pepper Potts and Jeff Bridges and tells the story of a billionaire playboy Tony Stark being kidnapped and creating a suit to help him escape and fight those using weapons to do wrong. One of my most unpopular opinions when it comes to film series in general is that Iron Man is the best film in the first phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, meaning I liked it more than the Avengers. The Avengers is soon to come in my MCU Series of film reviews so for now, I'll just explain why without comparing. Iron Man is a film I describe using the word effortless because that word describes how the filmmakers made it look to craft an excellent superhero film. The career redeeming and defining performance from Robert Downey Jr here as Tony Stark would forever have many fans (including myself for a few years) calling him Tony instead of Robert. He was suave, charming and understood the subtleties of playing a character who could be downright arrogant at times but was still good at heart and somebody you could root for. Shaun Taub was excellent as Yinsen and it was honestly a tragedy he was in the film for such a short time but the lessons he taught Tony helped shape his character throughout the entirety of the 21 following MCU films and definitely was the heartbeat of this film. Some of his lines while they were in captivity I can still quote to this day such as ""This is an important week for you isn't it"" and especially ""Don't waste your life Stark"". It was awesome to see Stark progress as a character from being a man who didn't seem to care about what his actions did to others to somebody desperately trying to keep others safe from mistakes he himself made. The script was beautifully written and never directly had any of the characters state what the message of the film was but rather let their actions speak it for themselves. I will say though that the only weak point of this movie for me was the third act in that the movies villain was mediocre at best. What Obidiah Stane wanted was purely monetary and self-involved and looking back on it, it didn't really make much sense why he did what he did. Without spoiling this film because I definitely think you should watch it without knowing much if you somehow haven't seen it, it feels like his plan wasn't really complete. Sure, he had access to a certain device that would help level the playing field but in no way did it tip the scale fully in his favor. Still though he was wonderfully portrayed by Jeff Bridges taking a sharp turn away from roles like in ""The Big Lebowski"" and at least came across as intimidating. Gwyneth Paltrow played Pepper Potts very well here and continued to play her well throughout the course of the MCU which is more than I can say for Terrence Howard. Howard did a fine job playing James Rhodes but I think that most fans would agree that Don Cheadles portrayal during films where War Machine made appearances was much more charismatic, serious when it needed to be and enjoyable. Also Iron Man started a trend in which all phase one movies featuring the armored avenger featured AC/DC which was awesome. I love AC/DC as a band and as a representation of the badass Iron Man armor and smooth as ice Tony Stark underneath it as well. I'm still wondering why we didn't get AC/DC in Iron Man 3 or any other appearances thereafter but hey, I'm not a member of the creative team behind Marvel so whatever. Also before I give my final thoughts on the film I'd like to point out that the effects still look pretty decent twelve years later even if they are slightly dated. I remember how amazing they looked back when I first saw the film when I was seven. I was awestruck by this movie honestly, Tony Stark was always so cool and I remember drawing and designing my own Iron Man armor when I was younger. I also tried to be a smartass as a kid to match Stark so maybe not all of the good rubbed off on me but Iron Man, the Sam Raimi Spider-Man film trilogy and the X-Men movies all I used to watch as a kid because they were really amazing on a writing, directing and action front and I wished I lived in the universe of all of those movies. I also used to like the Transformers movies as a kid though and looking back on it now... Yeah, let's look back ahead. Point is movies like Iron Man blew my mind as a kid and remind me of what I will always love about movies, how they can influence you.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

The first time I properly saw this was around Christmas time, 2008. I had got the DVD as a gift and I was so happy when I got the chance to watch it... that was 11 years ago...
POSITIVES!
When it comes to this kind of character, it is a smart move to begin with an origin story. I do, however, believe that the film is mistitled. It should called ""Tony Stark"" and that isn't a bad thing. Clearly. The way that the character, and story, is written is such a strong character piece that it propels this widely unknown character to A-Level reception. What this character goes through to put him on a journey to become a ""superhero"" is a very entertaining narrative. This is a testament to the writers, director, and especially the incredible Robert Downey Jr. This man is a treasure in real life and an artist in film... it also helps that he is just so natural because the character is pretty much himself. Downey is great with the comedic side, believable in the dramatic side, and as heroic as a hero can be. Downey shares great chemistry with his co-stars; Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow, and, for his one-time appearance, Terence Howard. Jon Favreau stars in front of the camera but excels behind it as the director. Like Downey, Favreau can balance all these genres to create a very coherent tone with some great action sequences. Those action scenes are packed full of visual effects that still hold up a decade later, and for years to come. The balance of CGI and practical was very strong, obviously I'm in favour of practical, but the CGI is sound. The look of the film. With its sets in imagery has a touch of sci-fi, but it is grounded. The suits/armour utilized in the film are my personal favourites. For a long time, this is what I think of when I think of Iron Man. The sounds that emanate from the suits (repulsor blasts) are fun to mimic, especially when you're a child and obsessed with the character. It has a decent score, but it has a very rock'n'roll centric soundtrack that works.
NEGATIVES!
My only real negative with this film affects and could've affected the MCU, but mainly the Iron Man franchise. And that's the treatment of Jeff Bridges' antagonist character, Obadiah Stane and the third act. This character could've had the potential to be the Lex Luthor to Iron Man's Superman. But, spoiler alert for a 10-year-old film, the character is killed off. The character builds the ""Iron Monger"" suit to square-off against the hero after just being argumentative about replicating the Iron Man armour... 5 mins later he gets an arc reactor and magically has a suit of armour. The Iron Man vs. Iron Monger fight isn't anything special. There are plot points that come back around that are fun nods, but other than that, the final fight sequences get better as the universe expands. After Obadiah Stane is killed, in a lacklustre way, the character is forgotten about as the MCU continues. No remorse or even a reference to the character. I would've preferred that the character becomes a behind the scenes type of villain throughout the Iron Man franchise, building up to an explosive fallout between Stark and Stane. But the film went in a different direction.
CONCLUSION!
So, Iron Man was such a great choice to begin this Cinematic Universe. It's said a lot in interviews that anyone (meaning franchises) could've been in RDJ's and the film's shoes, being the one to kick-off the franchise. But I very much appreciate Iron Man being the first film. Not only for what it did for the character, but for the people behind it. Regarding RDJ's rough history in the public eye, Jon Favreau not being a massive name in the industry directing Indie Films, and just the status of the Iron Man character being a C-Level character. And now, look around. Robert Downey Jr. is back and better than ever, Favreau is doing some massive movies, and Iron Man's popularity is compared to Spider-Man, and Batman. That's because of this extremely entertaining blockbuster!",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

Still, Marvel decisively put their trust in the hands of up and coming director Jon Favreau, and unlike Marvel's other minor characters (Daredevil, Punisher, Ghost Rider) they gave Iron Man a big budget with a Grade A cast and unlimited unrestraint.

Robert Downey Jr fights with the enemy in a robot suit.It inferior to the conventional action movie by all means, but it is very excited. I want to imitate the way of just attack. The story is good. Robert Downey Jr is a genius but is a little selfish. He make weapon for peace, but he know his weapon is used by terrorism, and his enemy imitates his technology. He is cornered by the enemy robot which is based on his technology, but he fights with strong will, and wins! Its a recommendation.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

Iron Man takes you in during the first ten minuets and doesn't let up to the lights come on in the theater. Although I liked Transformers better, Iron Man's dialogue is more for an adult audience. The action isn't as much as I thought would be, but when there was, it was very solid. Robert Downey Jr. is hilarious as Tony Stark, so the comedic side was a bonus.

1172,7 May 2008,Bobbydange,6," Entertaining... But I want more than that
","Okay I'm not going to bash iron man too much but I have to be honest about how this movie is nothing more than just another modern day action movie and nothing really great. I have to start out by saying that I'm not a hardcore Iron Man fan so there might have been things in the movie that only the big fans understood and if that's the case then I suppose this would be a pretty good movie for you, but I'm coming from the average audience point of view. I love movies. I've watched movies all the way from Metropolis, to The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, to The Godfather, to Taxi Driver, to Reservoir Dogs and so on. I feel like Iron Man could have been so different. Like it could have been so much more grittier. Like right from the beginning of the film I saw what they were going for when they introduced Tony Stark in the movie. They were going for the ""Good but at the same time an anti-hero"" type character. I just don't feel like they pulled it off realistically. Like there were parts in the movie where I really didn't understand what he was suppose to be. I mean there were parts where he was acting like such a wuss. Why? Watch The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Pay attention to how Clint Eastwood never breaks character and always has the gritty yet good personality throughout the whole movie. That's what I expected. I expected him to have that complete bad ass personality the whole way through. Now don't get me wrong. There were parts in the movie that were really cool. Like the part where he crashes into the ground after being shot down, then gets back up in the coolest way, then shoots the little rocket at the tank and walks away like such a bad ass as the tank explodes. In fact that was my favorite part of the whole movie. Now, this is all I'm saying right here... WHY? Why could't the whole movie have looked like that one part and give you the feel that that one part gave you. That feeling that made you think ""Now this is Iron Man! This is past what I expected. This is as cool as it gets."" I mean did you notice that the rest of the movie didn't look anything like that one specific part of the movie? I did. I was waiting for another scene that had the smooth cool action and camera shots that that one part had but it just didn't happen. Some parts where pretty humorous, I'll give it that, it's always nice to have comic relief in an action movie, but there where times in the movie where the jokes just seemed so forced on you. Like you would laugh but it really wasn't that funny. It almost seemed like they were just filling in runtime for the movie with corny jokes and some subtle humor as if they were trying to avoid having a better and smoother storyline. Now overall the movie was actually not that bad but here is the one thing that killed it for me. Even if the movie was next to perfect but it still had this one thing it would have killed it for me. This movie had the worst use of Terrence Howard! Why was he so gay? I remember specifically seeing him being introduced in the movie and right away I thought ""Oh cool! He is an awesome actor! He was good in Crash, he was good in Hustle and Flow and he is probably going to be pretty cool in this movie..."" No... he comes into the movie and he sounds like he just got off of the set of Leave it to Beaver. I thought he was Tony Stark's love interest. And who the hell whouldn't have guessed right off the back that Jeff Bridges was going to be the bad guy? The movie makes it so obvious. I mean I'm actually wondering if I should really be putting a spoilers warning on here. Like when you see all those terrorist and he gets out of the limo and that was suppose to be the crazy part where you find out he is the bad guy I was seriously thinking ""What? That was the twist? Nobody knew? Was this really a twist?"" I mean I guess it was, but nobody seemed to be fooled. The movie was predictable. At just about every part in the movie I could predict what was going to happen in the next few minutes. What I'm saying is this. The movie isn't dark and gritty. It's full of American Cheese. It has that pg 13 feel to it. There are some funny parts. Like you get to see Robert Downey Jr get thrown at a wall insanely hard at various times where he is testing out his suit and every once and a while there will be a good line here and there that will make you laugh. It's worth going to see. But it will probably be one of those movies that you say ""Yeah. I saw it. It was cool.

","When I went into theaters, I didn't think Iron Man would be all that good. I thought it would be another comic book-turned-movie mess up like The Hulk, Ghost Rider, or X-Men (excluding X-Men 2 of course). Yet this film is one of the greater super hero movies I've seen. With its superb visuals to its magnificent main character played by Robert Downey Jr. who seems like he was born for the role of Tony Stark a.k.a Iron Man. It begins when Tony Stark is in Afghanistan on an army convoy when it's attacked by terrorists. He is captured and is forced to build a missile of his own for the terrorists to use in dominating Asia and possibly even the world in time. Instead, he secretly builds a suit of armor that helps him escape ultimately leading to his rescue. When he gets back to the U.S. he decides to no longer build weapons and put people in harms way. He builds two suits, the Mark II and the Mark III that he uses to fight against the same terrorists that captured him. Eventually Obadiah Stane, who is sort of second in command at Stark Industries, uses his own suit and becomes Iron Monger, trying to kill Iron Man so he can rule over Stark Industries himself. The movies' combined action, visual effects, characters, and humor make this movie one of the top three super hero movies of all time.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

This movie is so much more than just your usual superhero flick with a box office collection of more than five hundred million dollars. For one, it is the base for the Avengers film series and subsequent intersecting characters and story lines , which would eventually be called the Marvel Cinematic Universe or the MCU. Not to forget Iron Man gave Robert Downey Jr a new chance to prove that he's one of the most talented actors out there. Kudos to director Jon Favreau for brilliant casting and depicting the origin story of probably the coolest superhero.
Talking about the movie itself, Robert Downey Jr does a fantastic job portraying a genius billionaire turned self made superhero. Iron Man is proof that you don't need to have to go through an extra terrestrial or supernatural or magical event to gain superpowers. But if you're smart and hardworking and (being a little rich wouldn't hurt), you could develop a bullet proof armored suit that can fly ,shoot energy beams and missiles. Not bad for a human, huh? With the perfect amount of humor, high flying action, and a conventional yet interesting story line, Iron Man is an ageless film and if you've watched the Infinity Saga, watching this again will definitely be a different feeling!",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

The only thing that I disliked about this movie was the ending. Usually for me to like an ending in a Marvel movie with a boss fight, I'd have to see over the top fighting sequences where the protagonist gets seriously injured, but incredulously counters the antagonist's attacks and manages to absolutely beat the crap out of them until the antagonist does something that leads to their death or they go to jail. For this movie, however, that is not the case. The stakes are high during the end of the movie, with Tony Stark making a decision that could ultimately cost him his life. The antagonist, Iron Monger, instead has a fall scene where instead of getting the crap beat out of him, he encounters a fatal error that costs him his life.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

Another thing that bothered me was the fact that it had to be about weapons in Afghanistcan. Personally, I am tired of all that business going on overseas and I don't want to see anymore of that dribble. The plot of the movie was poorly done and loosely thrown together.

","Iron Man works because of two reasons- The storyline flows smoothly, and the powerhouse performance of Robert Downey Jr. as the titular Iron Man/ Tony Stark. The charisma of Downey Jr. coupled with a great emphasis on character development makes Iron Man one of the best Superhero avatars of all time. The non-suited human element of a superhero film should be interesting in someway be it his sorrow or travails or in his embodiment of a larger than life, cool figure, and this is a fact many films do not foresee, or even realize. Jon Favreau has crafted a great movie and Robert Downey Jr. is so good you cannot picture anyone else play him. The film is fun in a charming way and the action pieces are embedded to flow the story, and not as a stopover for special effect show-off. The side parts are played well by everyone involved from Gwyneth Paltrow to Terrence Howard. Its been ten years since Iron Man was released and so much has happened both in his journey and the ascent of superhero movies but the first film remains a pinnacle.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

Iron Man was written by James Favreau's 12 year old son, with the help of that bumbling idiot Toby Mcguire. Mcguire was able to manipulate Favreau's son into creating an even worse flick than spaceman, to prevent spaceman from being the obviously most awful super hero movie ever.

The people who died when they become Iron Man or Captain America the person who dies will points to their chest and to represent that they have a heart to protect the people who they cared about and I like how they reuse that same scene with Captain America. During the second act while he is building and test flying his suits I will always laugh at them because he recorded for himself and see if there is any improvement on them. Which shows of his intelligence of making things other than building engines for hot rods which he done that already and show that in the film which also makes him a car mechanic like my Dad does. (except my Dad doesn't drink all the time like Stark does) Anyways I really do genuinely feel for his character a lot because of his abuse of alcohol, his personally to be an arse sometimes, and I felt really scared at times when the shrapnel in his chest would eventually kill him someday and how he has to deal with it for a pretty long time for a good doctor to remove it without killing him.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

1299,29 March 2019,B-R-M,8," Review: Iron Man
","Downey's performance is intriguing and unexpected. He Doesn't behave like most superheroes: he lacks psychic weight and gravity. Tony Stark has been created from the person Downey has created through many films: irreverent, Peculiar, self-critical, wise. The fact that Downey has permission to think and speak as he does while using all that hardware represents a bold decision on the part of the director, Jon Favreau. If I hadn't wanted that, I probably wouldn't have hired Downey. Downey is So comfortable with the dialogue of Tony Stark, so familiar that it sounds to come from him, that the script seems to have been dictated by the person of Downey.
There Are Some things that some actors can say with security on the screen, and other things that they can't. The person of Robert Downey Jr. Would find it difficult To get away with big and deep statements (in an ""entertainment"", anyway, a more serious film like ""Zodiac"" is another matter). Some superheroes speak in a kind of accented semi-formal prose, as if dictated to Bartlett's family appointments. Not Tony Stark. I Could talk that way and be Juno's uncle. "" Iron Man ""doesn't seem to know how seriously most superhero movies take themselves. If there is ingenuity in the dialogue, it is often assumed that the superhero does not know it. If There is ample humour, it usually belongs to the villain. What happens in ""Iron Man"" However, is that sometimes we ask ourselves how seriously Stark takes it. He is frivolous in the face of disaster, casual on the brink of ruin.
I Think it's prudent for Favreau to position the rest of the characters on a more serious line. The cast of support wisely does not try to overcome it. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Pepper Potts as a woman who is seriously concerned that this fool commits suicide. Jeff Bridges makes Obadiah Stane one of the great superhero villains apparently plausibly concerned about the stock price. Terrence Howard, like Colonel Rhodes, is at all times a conventional straight arrow. What a horror show it would have been if everyone was tuned to Tony Stark's sardonic vibe. We Would Return to the World of Swingers (1996) which was written by Favreau.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

","At this point in time Marvel was in a very rough place. Starting what would become the most successful franchise of all time started with this insane risk that Marvel Studios took. Not only were they the underdogs but for their lead they cast Robert Downey Jr. Who people never thought would have a career after the legal trouble he went through. Along with that they also took the risk of taking a lesser known B tier character from their catalog to spark this cinematic universe they had planned and releasing it around the same time of the greatest comic book film of all time The Dark Knight. This would go on to change the film industry forever and if it were not for those insane risks Marvel Studios took then there would be no MCU. If this did not have Robert Downey Jr. As Iron Man this movie I don't think would have ever worked you cannot imagine anybody else in this role. His chemistry works with every character you see on screen and elevates this film and everyone else performances so much. The humor here is very smart and Robert Downey Jr. Adds his own charisma to the jokes. This film also showcases how to begin a cinematic universe correctly (DC take notes) if you are watching this for the first time you don't know that they are setting the MCU up but you get little hints along the way that they are and the big reveal at the end with Nick Fury is so satisfying. Tony Stark has this crazy development starting out as a self-centered, arrogant morally bad man and throughout the events that take place here he drastically changes and the ""I am Iron Man"" line gets so much more meaning from the story told here. Obadiah Stane AKA Iron Monger is a more forgettable villain though in the MCU which is not necessarily a bad thing and I like the plot of wanting to replicate the Iron Man suit but if you have not seen this more than once he is kind of forgettable I feel its was a little unnecessary to kill him off and they maybe could have done more with him in the future.

Stark escapes, destroying all of the weapons the terrorists stole, and has a change of heart. He decides that his company, Stark Enterprises, will no longer manufacture weapons, and instead, focus on humanitarian research. This doesn't sit well with his business partner, Obidiah Stane, who seeks to get rid of Stark so he can run the company, and use the technology for his own maniacal deeds. Yes, Stane is the villain. The next half hour or so is devoted to Stark building and trying out new versions of his armor, so that he can carry out his desire to do something more with his life.

","Ironman is an amazing movie. Why? it's enjoyable. plain and simple. It will appease the hordes of comic nerds and never-touched-a-comic-book-in-my-life people. With me being part of the latter group, I had no idea what to expect. I went in expecting a popcorn movie (which it was, lets not lie) and got a great movie experience. I was sad when it ended cause well it ended. Robert Downey Jr. is amazing. You can feel his anger, fear, intelligence and frat-boy mentality that is Tony Stark (the guy in the suit) radiate from the screen. He might, MIGHT, be able to get some serious nominations for his acting. It's a huge sharer turnaround. Downey owns the whole movie in it's enierty. every scene he's in he controls it. he doesn't act, he becomes Tony Stark, it's creepy. All you can do is believe him. I personally don't think that anyone could make this nut case of a charciter feel real. Yet he is the most realistic superhero brought to the screen. No mutant bug bite, no gamma radiation, no mutant gene. Just Himself, hard work, and a weird magnet in his chest. (only thing in the movie that is a real stretch. I bought it cause the movie explains it the best they could and it's the basis of the comic. For example: How can anyone explain the reason spider-man didn't die from such a rapid change in DNA: from human to spider? Just go with it.) Ironman is Marvel's Batman. they don't have superpowers, they have to create the powers themselves. (though Stark goes no where near Batman's emo outlook) The special effects have mentioning too. They used special effects when absolutely needed. THey built a real ironman suit. CGI was placed around it. Other roles, such as Pepper Potts, are nicely played. Paltrow nicely acts the sexual tension between Stark and Potts. Pay attention during scenes between them. lovely acting + good script + some chemistry = great movie moments. GO SEE THIS MOVIE. NOTES (big Spoilers!! you were warned): the scene after the credits is not important. just a cliff hanger that serves a trailer for another ironman movie (i was going to see the second movie anyway). listen to the ironman song during the credits and leave. look for Capitan America's shield when Stark is in his basement.

","Ron Man works because of two reasons- The storyline flows smoothly, and the powerhouse performance of Robert Downey Jr. as the titular Iron Man/ Tony Stark. The charisma of Downey Jr. coupled with a great emphasis on character development makes Iron Man one of the best Superhero avatars of all time. The non-suited human element of a superhero film should be interesting in someway be it his sorrow or travails or in his embodiment of a larger than life, cool figure, and this is a fact many films do not foresee, or even realize. Jon Favreau has crafted a great movie and Robert Downey Jr. is so good you cannot picture anyone else play him. The film is fun in a charming way and the action pieces are embedded to flow the story, and not as a stopover for special effect show-off. The side parts are played well by everyone involved from Gwyneth Paltrow to Terrence Howard. Its been ten years since Iron Man was released and so much has happened both in his journey and the ascent of superhero movies but the first film remains a pinnacle.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

Upon seeing the movie, I realized how badly I had misjudged it. The visuals were spectacular and really suck you into the story, rather than detract from it. The acting was very well done as well. Robert Downey Jr. puts on a show alone with his portrayal of the billionaire bad ass. Gwyneth Paltrow along with Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges serve as strong support to Downey's character. The humor that is incorporated into the film hits its mark rather than other movies in which it feels unnecessary. This may not be the absolute best superhero movie, but it will indeed go down with the other good superhero movies of recent (Spiderman, new Batman movies). You will not be disappointed.

RDJ as Tony is phenomenal, and he is a really good love interest for Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts. Up until Marvel's The Avengers, Iron Man was the best movie of The MCU (and is considered to still be). Besides the good pros, there was some problems with the casting, like Terrence Howard. The introduction to the movie was too long, I would've preferred a 20-30 minute introduction as to how Tony escaped the ten rings, but 45 minutes was way too long, considering it took up more than 1/3 of the movie. It left few space to fit in the plot for the next 90 minutes, and most of it fit cramped into the movie.

","Contrary to many people I didn't read this comics. I only knew the name of this Hero and that he wore an armor. Then I can't compare the movie with the BD, I can't simply speak about the movie. And it's more than enough. Before I see it I was scared that it would be like others totally failed (at random, fantastic 4). But Iron man is not one of these piece of these bad movie. The movie has much qualities particularly great acting, visual effect... Robert Downey Junior is not the most famous actor in Hollywood hence I'm very surprise how he mastered Stark character. He play perfectly this eccentric billionaire, all the film is based on the starks character. It's almost the Downey Jr one man show, but that not damages the movie quality. Effectively the other actors are really good and find their place in the show. In particularly Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) whose the relationships with Tony are very funny. By the way humor is very well inserted in the movie especially by Tony. Besides the great acting the movie benefits from impressive visual effects. Particularly during the Iron Man scene of flight and fight. Of course it the least it can be for ""Iron Man"". To summarize Iron Man is a success, brilliant mixing between great visual effects good acting and humor. This movie is as solid as a piece of steel! You can definitively go watch this movie.

""i've become comfortable in an industry that has zero accountability""...and that line set up the rest of the movie and iron man's ultimate battle. the writers did a good job of expanding the inner conflict and pressures of a super hero beyond just 'how am i going to maintain a normal life and still save the world beginning at dusk?' to 'how am i going to undo my wrong, save the world and maintain a normal life'...great story.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

","FINALLY! A superhero movie comes along that perfectly assembles all the qualities of a Marvel Comic book and neatly transfers them from Comic to Cinema. While Sam Raimi's Spider-Man (2002) was a fun and glossy roller-coaster of a movie it didn't quite capture the danger of Spidey's world and the character himself wasn't the heroic comedian the way fans love him. Bryan Singer's X-Men movies offered up the right quota of the mutant's dangerous and hunted lives but lost a lot of the hallmarks of the characters in terms of the iconic costumes, character trademarks and the multi-coloured qualities of a dark world. What Jon Favreau did with Iron Man is on a similar level to what the great Richard Donner achieved with Superman The Movie (1978) and Superman II (1980), and it is very simple : he made a movie faithful to its source material AND fresh and original with enough of the hallmarks of a successful summer blockbuster and everyone left the cinema satisfied. There is real heart in what Favreau did. The way he didn't shirk the icons of Iron Man as character, lovingly showing first the bulky Silver armour and then being bold enough and not in the least embarrassed to show the beauty of the Red and Gold armour in full flight. He really gets a good sense of Jack Kirby into his movie, and while it might seem petty of me to point to Iron Mans armour being correct as a sign of the movie being a success, its things like that that makes us all fans in the first place and its great when a director like Favreau or Richard Donner comes along and isn't embarrassed by the material he is working with. The casting of Robert Downey JR as Tony Stark/Iron Man was a true master stroke of genius on Favreaus behalf. I've always loved Downey's performances from Chaplin onward and i always thought he was a superstar in waiting who just needed to sort his turbulent life out and find the right role that would ignite him into super nova. With this movie he found the perfect character and he gives us one of the truly great Superhero performances, up there with Christopher Reeve as Superman in my opinion. Downey is everything the character needs to be and maybe wasn't on paper. Unlike the cliché of a brooding millionaire type it could of become ala Bruce Wayne, Downey makes Tony Stark a fun guy who lives life to the full, who is funny, a man you would like to hang out with, who enjoys life and its truly refreshing to see him take flight in the character. Downey makes the armour real, makes it come alive in the same way Christopher Reeve made you believe a man could fly. He is backed up by a great ensemble supporting cast, just as invigorating as watching Downey have fun with his character it is the same watching Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts: Supportive, warm and sexy you never for one minute doubt that she cares about Tony Stark. Jeff Bridges is an absolute sensation as Obidiah Stane. I've been a big fan of Jeff Bridges since childhood, loved him in Tron (1982) and Starman (1984) and it is great that with this movie he finally found a huge blockbuster size audience and im sure his popularity in this movie payed dividends in his winning the Oscar for best actor for Crazy Heart two years later. My only irk with the entire movie is that the plot is waiffer thin, but the great atmosphere generated by the cast and direction makes up for that. The action scenbes and special effects are fantastic and the whole pace of the movie is fun and flowing. Iron MJan is a movie that is proud to carry the name Marvel and as a representation of the Red and Gold Armour clad hero, a more faithful adaptation could not have been made. Well done to all concerned.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

","So, ignoring a complete lack of respect for the viewer's suspension of disbelief and a few major plot holes, the film was, well, still pretty terrible. To sum it up: if you're going to make a super-hero movie, make a super-hero movie. This seems like its just the back story for the sequel (which I'm sure is due to be thrown at us any moment now). What plot there is seems to have the subtlety of a crow bar and was shoved down the viewer's throat with the care of a run-away train. Tony Stark, our protagonist, is the lovable sap that acts as the face of a weapons company who is blissfully unaware that his products are being used on both sides of the battlefield. It takes a kidnapping for him to figure it out, and he returns blissfully angry as hell, not doubting for a second the other heads of the company until it is, again, spelled out for him. This lovable idiot, although completely inept at common sense (as well as being without the ability to solve simple problems with his hot rod without his computer), manages to design, fabricate, program, and perfect only the most advanced weapons system ever using stock components and he does it in a CAVE. Not to be underdone, when he gets home, he does it again, I suppose, just for the hell of it. Still rightfully angry as hell, he blows up some stuff, enrages his enemies, and blows up some stuff. The movie (and I mean the movie, not the production staff) think that it's so clever in this depart from the traditional superhero storyline that it flat out screams it through several passages with somewhat less than witty dialog.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

I have never in my life seen a Robert Downey Jr. film, nor have I ever read an Iron Man comic or watched the cartoons. I was told that Robert Downey Jr. played a small role in a film I watched a few years back called Natural Born Killers. That wasn't assuring because I hated that movie. The movie kicks off suspenseful and is loaded with action from start to end. Robert Downey Jr. probably plays the best role as a superhero, Even HE'd play a better Spiderman. He gives the movie a large comical influence. The rest of the cast also played a crucial role in the movie's excellence. The plot isn't like something you've never seen, and it is something you would expect in a superhero film... it's above average.

","I walked into the movie with low expectations for the record. Comic book movies this day and age are alright, and there are definitely titles I enjoyed and proudly adorn among my DVD collection - but there's a lot of hit and miss in the field and not a lot of movies in general seem comfortable with themselves these days. So the movie starts... And it's loud, flashy, the action scene editing is too quick to take it all in, the main character is a prick, the film has a lot of cheap jokes and gags, some of the dialog is corny, the plot is so predictable you can see the ending coming from a mile away, the actors and typecast, John Favreau is not an insane action director, there's too many characters and there's more vfx shots than in Spiderman. - wow, it sounds like this movie stinks... but if you pay attention to the subject heading you'll see what I'm getting at. The things we'd normally find flaws in these kinds of movies make this one fun and excel and, as one of my friends said, ""I haven't been this excited about a movie in a long time."" I can cop out and try and solve why all this works by hailing Favreau's superb direction, the all-star cast for their strong performances, ILM for the great work they brought to the table... but all these just enhance it and take it from being a good movie to an excellent movie. I have to credit the writers first and foremost for the fact they made a solid and tight script with just enough humor, just enough action and just enough drama that you don't notice anything else but that you are having a good time. The true villain is very predictable, which normally irritates me - but it's not building up to an ""aha"" moment in any sense of the term, so they aren't wasting time trying to keep it mysterious and failing. Iron Man also is subject to some very cheap humor, but it pushes it further and actually causes you to burst out in laughter (something most good comedies fail). The story is tight, the characters are fun, the action feels good and rough, and for all the reasons we rip other films to pieces, Iron Man makes you want to see it again... and again... and again. Which brings me to question... then what exactly is wrong with the movies that we find so terrible.

Tony Stark is a crazy fearless genius who celebrates challenge - and life. After Downey's performance, I can't imagine anyone else playing that role. So, suspend your disbelieve on all levels, and enjoy RDJ!",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

",WOW!! first of all i have to say that marvel should go solo in regards to making movies as what a difference it made this film is excellent and worthy of the 8 out of 10 i gave it. As Robert Downey JNR is perfect for this role as later on Tony stark lapses into alcoholism as did Downey for a brief period also the chemistry between Downey and Paltrow was fantastic they had a real buzz together and what a film for her to make her comeback the action sequences were exciting and believable they excel the fight scenes from fantastic four which look like they were lifted from a Childerens TV show. The reason why this film does not receive 10 out of 10 is because there are a couple of things that slightly annoyed me the first being their was a little bit to many jokes in their it sort of lowered the tone a bit. The second being that Terrence Howard was wasted in his role they cast this well known face and didn't bother to use him really at all. Overall however i think that this film was a no holes barred thrill ride from start to finish and dare i say it the best of the marvel line up of films so far can't wait for a sequel!!!,/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

Director: John Favreau was a great director for this first movie and the seriousness that he took with the movie really shows through and brings the entire movie together. The movie would not be the same without him and I dare say the MCU would not be the same.
Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark aka Iron Man: Downey did a fantastic job in this movie and the level of improve that he did make the movie all the more better. He carried him self in every scene and really was the highlight of the movie as it should have been.
Jeff Bridges as Obadiab Stane aka Iron Monger: Bridges did a fantastic job in the role of Stane and gave the character a level of almost seniority over the cast which really did imminate over the character.
Terrence Howard as James Rhodey: Howard played the character very well, but for some reason every scene with him in it I lost him in the scene because the rest of the cast overshadows him in their performances.

","Just started my MCU marathon for Avengers Endgame and watching Iron-Man for probably the 10th time. Decided it was time to rank all the MCU movies and what better way than to write my first real movie review! Saw this film for the first time when I was 15 and I've become way to emotionally attached to the MCU. Looking back Iron Man was probably the best way ever to start this thing called an MCU and get it on it's feet with RDJ being the coolest man probably ever. I was never big into comic books but still had so many favorite super heros in the form of cartoons with Spidey being my favorite by far, I never really got introduced to Iron Man not that I can remember so starting with Tony Stark was great. We got introduced to another incredible man as well... CAN I GET A ONE TIME for AGENT COULSON! Still one of my favorite characters in all of Marvel! Also going to shoutout my guy HO Yinsen his time in the MCU did not even last thirty minutes, BUT he might be one of the most important characters in all of these 20 plus movies! The guy who not only saves Tony's life but starts him down a path that really shapes his entire character arc through all the movies to come. The man helps Tony build the MARK ONE! Some badass points for sure! Then sacrificed himself to make sure Tony escaped, this is for sure one of Tony's most important relationship throughout the entire MCU!

There was no character development, the moral was cheap (proof that Tony Stark has a heart, come on), the storyline very predictable, Terrence Howard complete unbelievable as a war general and Jeff Bridges as an evil guy who suddenly decides to drive to some terrorist camp in the heart of Afghanistan (that's just a twist, not a plot).

It looks fabulous, the whole film is very slickly made with top-notch special effects(which look like time and effort was really put into it), awesome-looking futuristic gadgets and Iron Man's suit will be a guaranteed delight to anybody who is familiar or loves anything to do with the superhero. There is a pulsating soundtrack that adds much to the tension of the first half of the story and the enormously fun action sequences, which are exciting and tense with expertly choreography. The script crackles with smart humour that doesn't go overload, all of which is laugh-out-loud funny, yet the hostage plotting that takes up the first part of the film is intelligently written and somehow avoids being over-serious or over-familiar. The story has enough to allow you to emotionally connect with Iron Man(who I've always considered one of Marvel's most interesting and multi-faceted characters) and has a clever mix of the comic's 1960s origins and the effects of contemporary war, which will provide plenty of nostalgia while also feeling relevant. Jon Favreau does a great job directing, he never loses control of the story and he doesn't do anything too fussy. Robert Downey Jnr's performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man is a power-house and one of his best, doing much with the smart dialogue while making the emotional side of the characters wholly believable. Gwyneth Paltrow is a good, loyal side-kick with wise-cracks that don't come across as annoying and Jeff Bridges is surprisingly very good in an against-type role. Personally, the only disappointments were the useless character of Christine Everheart and the somewhat rushed and over-blown finale that wasn't quite as thrilling as it could have been, other than that Iron Man was a classy addition to the Marvel cannon and a great film on its own. 10/10 Bethany Cox.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

","After watching the overblown Spider-Man 3 last year; and the special effects driven Transformers, I was beginning to think that Hollywood didn't know how to make a decent comic book movie anymore. Then Jon Favreau directed Iron Man. The first thing that he does right is casting Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark. He brings a presence to the character that only he could and has the greatest one-liners that would even put Spider-Man to shame. Jeff Bridges, Terrance Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow are also great in their supporting roles. I loved the banter between Pepper and Stark. However, some fans may be disappointed by the lack of CGI and action scenes but I think it works for the better. It's grounded in reality and unlike Transformers, this film has realistic special effects and the CGI seamlessly blends in with all of the practical effects; most notably the Iron Man suit. And after watching Stark tinker around with his first two prototypes (watching the scene in which he tries to fly is priceless), it's a real payoff when after an hour we finally get to see him in action. This makes more sense than other comic book adaptations because we get to see the suit in three different stages. And besides all the action it's the most fun I've ever had watching a movie. There are so many scenes that end with a punch you won't regret watching this with a large audience. Not to mention that it ends on a great note. Also, comic book fans will dig the hints at a sequel and especially the post credit scene. Fans in our theater went crazy. (I won't spoil it for you.) Bottom line, Iron Man Delivers what a good comic book film should. It may not have the brooding darkness of Batman Begins, or the over the top special effects of Transformers, but it's a fun movie that has a terrific blend of humor, a great story, and not to mention some kick-ass action to go along with it.",/review/rw2601556/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_(2008

1566,1 August 2010,ty_thesoundguy,," Ironman resurrects careers
","Ironman!!! What can I say about this movie other than exceptional. This film will forever be known as the work that made Robert Downey Jr. a relevant actor again. His work as the character of Tony Stark was nothing short of spectacular. I also found the supporting roles by Terrence Howard as Rhodey, Stark's best friend and military liaison, Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts as Stark's personal assistant, and Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane were also performed quite well. I also thought that it added some much need ""big-screen"" relevance to Jeff Bridges career. The basic premise of the film is that Tony Stark, heir to his father's weapons and research and development company is ambushed and kidnapped by terrorists that his weapons were meant to destroy. Ironically, he was kidnapped by use of the very weapons by the same people they were meant to be used against. After Yinsen, played by Shaun Toub saved is life, Stark developed a defensive suit and used it to escape his captors. After returning to reality, as it were, Stark has a change of heart about what his company does and vows to stop creating weapons. He also develops a newer version of the Ironman suit and uses it to fight terrorism. Unfortunately, Stark comes to learn that Obadiah was actually behind the delivery of the weapons and even behind Stark's assassination attempt. Obadiah creates a much larger version of the suit and what results is some of the best action seen on the big screen today. The use of light and point of view action in this film provides the viewer with a truly unique perception not typically found in modern films. One truly gets to feel as if they are in the Ironman suit, flying around the world protecting people from terroristic threats. It also gives us a look into the future of technology, and I truly believe that most of what is portrayed in this film is either possible in the near future or already in practical use. This film has created a new legacy in the comic book hero genre and has resurrected the career of an almost forgotten talent.

","The release of the comic book story Ironman has been catapulted onto the gilded screen, directed by the likes of Jon Favreau. Starring Robert Downey Jr., Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Jeff Bridges, ""Ironman"" has a stellar all-star cast, not one you would expect for a high tech-robotic, body-of-armor, thriller-sci-fi flick.
(Warning spoilers are contained in this critic review of the film Ironman. You have been warned.)
With the inclusion of Downey, various stars, and the breathtaking cinematic imagery, Jon Favreau can do no wrong and proves it continuously in this decade-long comic book adaptation. Finally, for once the summer blockbuster is starting off with a ""boom"" as Ironman's robotic suit of armor equipped with jet propulsion flies in with style! The cast is amazing, anchored by Downey playing a multi-billionaire weapons manufacturer and genius Tony Stark. The movie has fans talking about Downey's flawless Oscar-worthy performance. The immaculate CGI special effects along with stellar pyrotechnics lead your imagination down a rollercoaster of over the top action and thrilling escape scenes.
Tony is a playboy genius, and weapons manufacturer who claims, ""Peace is about having a bigger stick than the other guy."" He has you thinking a little of what ingenious Howard Huges dreamed up as womanizing, wrench turning, hot rodding, gear junkie living in his high-tech fully AI automated cliffside Malibu mansion.
In the beginning, we see our intrepid Tony getting captured in Afghanistan by a ruthless terrorist organization hell-bent on having him build them a massively destructive weapon. Luckily our mortally injured Hero is held captive in a cave with his own weapons and has no intention of building a doomsday device, Tony is already planning his exit strategy. When Stark returns home after being held captive, he questions the direction of Stark Industries. Tony's recently acquired humanity and illuminating arc reactor are keeping Tony our hero alive and fighting.
Tony decides the iron clad suit that he used to escape is more than just idea. He is going to redesign the suit in a highly advanced red and gold suit of armor outfitted boldly with all the latest technology. Making the suit of armor a one man army that will transform Stark into Ironman.
This sends rifts through Stark Industries. Tony's life long mentor and friend Obadiah Stane (Bridges) has a few ideas of his own for Stark's suit of armor. The plot is discovered by his loyal assistant Pepper Potts (Paltrow) and Jim Rhodes (Howard) Pentagon liaison/friend. Will it be enough to help Ironman in this movie's metal-crushing climax, come face to face Iron clad nemesis?
