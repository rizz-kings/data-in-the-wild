","This movie contains some throughly enjoyable moments that are on par with some of Downey Jnr's highlights as Tony Stark. The relationship between Pepper and Tony is taken further and built upon brilliantly in this movie. It contains some really cool and innovative action scenes which are taken for granted now. However the poor villain, a pattern in Iron Man Solo Outings, and the lack of direction meant this is easily the poorest Iron Man Performance. It's still an entertaining watch but you wouldn't be wrong if you skipped this movie when rewatching MCU Classics.",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010

4,29 April 2010,DICK STEEL,10," A Nutshell Review: Iron Man 2
","Downey Jr continues his smirky role as the playboy and laissez-faire persona of Tony Stark (no Downey Jr, no Tony Stark I'd say!), now facing a life-threatening intoxication situation, and constantly having to deflect the US military's interest in and compelling him to turn over the Iron Man suit. Then of course there's the romantic angle with Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts who gets expanded screen time here, to whom he hands over Stark Industries to by appointing her CEO. I had enjoyed all the scenes between Paltrow and Downey Jr as they shared great chemistry, and didn't mind that the film took the pause from the action to throw the spotlight on this. In fact, Stark is pretty much the Santa Claus in giving away things, having to face his mortality and to put some business continuity plans into motion. A little too bad that the scene in the teaser trailer highlighting the banter in the plane didn't make it to the final cut.",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010

8,11 June 2010,khanbaliq2,8," An exhilarating and funny superhero sequel.
","Iron Man 2 is a fine sequel. Almost the whole cast returns intact, and director Jon Favreau has more screen time in his role as Happy Hogan. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is riding high after the events of Iron Man (2008). He has become famous worldwide, and he re-institutes the Stark Expo. But problems begin to pile up. Another wealthy industrialist wants his Iron Man technology. Then a new villain appears. Stark's relationship with his assistant Virginia Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is also expanded upon. There's a lot going on in the film, but its rather weak script hurts it for sure. Mickey Rourke as the villain Ivan Vanko stands out. He's more menacing than Obadiah Stane was in the first film. Vanko's first encounter with Stark leads to a thrilling fight scene. Unfortunately Rourke's character isn't fully developed. This is a problem with other characters in the film as well. Vanko is a memorable villain but if Rourke was given more screen time and his character had more of a backstory I'm sure he could have been even more memorable. Still, Rourke tried to make his character as complex as he could.",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010

12,28 April 2010,Dash1969,," Fun but also Smart! It has the right amount of humor, angst and drama
","Iron Man 2 sure delivers the fun but it's such intelligent fun. Honestly, its Stan Lee meets Shakespeare. The Hammer/Stark rivalry is more like Hamlet and Claudius then Superman to Lex Luthor. Iron Man is simply more complex as a character then anything else you'll see in a summer film but it loses none of the spark or none of the pure popcorn fun. How many other films can you say that about? Stark's vulnerability is very much on display here as his personal life crumbles through various unique conflicts. He has to struggle with the government for control of his armor and deal with his growing celebrity. At the same time his personal life takes a turn as a love triangle emerges. He (like soon all of America) becomes attracted to his new aide (the lovely Scarlett Johansson), causing tension with his former assistant but now new Stark Industries CEO Pepper Potts (the also lovely Gwyneth Paltrow). They manage to pull all this off remarkably well and still leave character time for Rhodey and the villains. It's a believable sci-fi story featuring an intellect story that's wild but has the right amount of humor, angst and drama. Like I remember about Iron Man 1, I can't think of a weak moment in the film. The visual effects are incredible. They did the memory of their boss, the great Stan Winston, proud. They set the bar high again. Now the only question is whether they have anything left in the tank for Iron Man 3? I'm betting that they do.",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010

","Reading Iron Man 2's plot summary, things sound bleak for our characters. But not at all. This is a breezy, light-hearted, inoffensive affair that saunters at a magnetic pace, with emotional discomfiting a far thought. Which is pretty refreshing, to say the least. In fact, Iron Man 2 is the complete of antithesis of recent comic book movies. For one, it certainly isn't darker than its predecessor, absent its slow-burning first half and latched-on social commentary. It also gives itself the poetic license to stretch credulity. This is a movie about a man who flies around in metal suit, blasting away multicolored-haired Russians with electric whips. Realism simply doesn't apply, and thankfully director Jon Favreau and writer Justin Theroux take affectionate liberty with the bonds of belief. Yes, Ivan Vanko can secretly build super technology unbeknownst to his suppliers. And yes, the only way to incapacitate a drunken Tony is to beat the crap out of him in a Iron Man suit.

You do not leave your I.Q. at the door with this summer movie as you too often need to do. The award winning cast doesn't back down and delivers up to their talent. They're rising to the material, and even elevating it to levels rarely seen in a comic adaptation film. Robert Downey Jr delivers another remarkable performance. Giving one of our generation's greatest actors such a cool character to bring to life happens once in a lifetime. Watching him draw on ALL emotions is as good as it gets. Not to give any spoilers but there's a dark side to Tony Stark because of his impending death and that aspect of the film makes Downey shine. Add the flair and superhero text and we may be talking Oscar. Mickey Rourke, Sam Rockwell, Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle also bring their top stuff.",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010
23,26 April 2010,IronBallsM,," Masterfully Executed Sequel! Action AND Heart... A Perfect Mix
","Yes, I'm one of the fortunate few who got to see this gem a bit early and I'm happy to report that they took what worked so well in Iron Man and ran with it in an extremely gratifying way. The complexity, depth, heart and action are even more off the charts than the first film. It's is not just a great comic book movie but a great movie period. They took the complexities of Tony Stark that they established in movie one and built upon it masterfully. Now we get a reformed and guilt ridden weapons manufacturer weaved with a celebrity who should have never let the cat out of the bag in the final moments of Iron Man 1. They promised to up the action from the first film and they certainly did but the storytelling never suffers for it. Like in 2008, the evolution and growth of the characters is of paramount importance. It has the same flavor and humor of the original and it may even focus more on the fabulous relationships already developed. I was stunned at how they managed to deliver a better film. I didn't think that was possible. Everyone came to play and this great cast brought their best stuff and it shows on screen. Everyone knew Downey, Paltrow and Cheadle could act but Bill O'Reilly and The CNN anchor? Yes, they show up and do a GREAT job in extended cameos. Rourke and Rockwell are PERFECT as the duel foils for Tony Stark, I mean PERFECT. From the Grand Prix in Monaco to the amazing finale, buckle up because this is one intense, interesting, intelligent and fun ride. My only real complaint is that Scarlett's Black Widow has too little screen time.

I am not one of those people, I actually think it is just as good as the first film. The first film had a bit more polish, but this one had more bang for your buck as the last action sequence in this film has more action than all of the cation scenes in the first film put together. They did recast Rhodes in this film substituting Don Cheadle for Terrance Howard, but quite frankly I thought it was an improvement. Cheadle just has a better presence than Howard and though they recast the role because Howard wanted more money, I think it worked in favor of the studio because Cheadle is a better actor. All the other primary players are accounted for as Robert Downey Jr. is back as Tony Stark/Iron Man and Gwyneth Paltrow is back as Pepper Potts. The two do great as a very eccentric pair and I thought Mickey Rourke as the villain was an improvement over Bridges in the first film.

Sequels are usually the ones that are much harder to get right and pull of, and Iron Man 2 nearly falls flat. The last thirty minutes are diabolically bad compared to the rest of the film, which, whilst it lasted, was pretty damn good. Things that could have certainly been improved upon were; Mickey Rourke as Whiplash, who i didn't think had enough screen time, and could have been fleshed out slightly better. The introduction of War Machine fighting alongside his ally Iron Man, was completely inappropriate as it made the climactic fight sequence corny and stupid. His fight with Iron Man at Starks home was also un called for, as if the director was adding the sequence just for the sake for a longer running time.

There's something about Robert Downey Jr's sarcastic tone and out there charisma that suits this character (no pun intended). Mickey Rourke & Sam Rockwell are now villains Ivan & Justin, two competitors of Tony Stark (Downey, JR). Don Cheadle plays James Rhodes, AKA Warhead, Scarlett Johansson plays Natalie, Samuel L.

","This is, without a doubt going to be one of my top 10 movies of 2010, quite possibly the number one film. I really can't see anything that could possibly top this film. One of my favorite movie going experiences EVER. I was thrilled with Iron Man back in 2008 but this takes that experience and adds to it. I'm so happy to report that unlike other sequels made only for a cash grab, Iron Man 2 delivers on every front possible. There is no doubt why IM2 will be the box office smash of 2010. With good reason, the film is well worth the price of admission, more so then any movie I've seen in years. Director Jon Favreau has done it again, with great style and flair. The new actors are injected perfectly. Mickey Rourke, Sam Rockwell and even good old Garry Shandling are exceptional. We all knew Scarlett Johansson could handle the sex appeal but she's especially good as Tony's new assistant/SHIELD operative. Don Cheadle trumps Terrance Howard's Rhodey in every way. I'm also relieved to report that Robert Downey Jr. and Gwenyth Paltrow are even more amazing in their lead roles. They've really grown in to embodying these wonderful characters. What many don't realize but soon will is that this film has tremendous depth. The lead characters all respond to turmoil and are fleshed out beautifully. Judging by the commercials, people may expect wild action but they are going to be pleasantly surprised at the complexity and depth of the film itself. What only adds to the experience is the fact that they managed to deliver fun in to the equation. This masterpiece is one of those rare summer event movies that really does deliver something for everyone.",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010

The film takes place six months after the original, and Tony Stark is loving the fame and publicity he's made with Iron Man. Tony is slowly being poisoned by the palladium in his arc reactor, until he can find a replacement. He soon develops a drinking problem. During a race at Monaco, Tony is attacked by Ivan Vanko/Whiplash. Whiplash teams up with a weapons manufacturer to perfect a line of armored combat units that will upstage Tony. The units begin to attack, which are remote-controlled by Whiplash. Iron Man must team up with War Machine in order to save the day.

","The first Iron Man was a great film, smart, exciting and classy with a powerhouse performance from Robert Downey Jnr. Iron Man 2 is not as good and is lacking in places, being not as classy, irreverent or exciting though it is not devoid of those qualities. The characters are not as interesting or as well-realised, Vanko is a little one-dimensional for a villain, Pepper's character is so reduced that what made her so endearing in the first is lost here and Natasha/Natalie's motivations are not as clear as they could have been. The story at times is over-familiar and cluttered with parts of the film that would have benefited from not trying to do too much and it could have had a tighter paced beginning. The script is certainly not bad with some amusing moments and one that make you think, but that of the first film has smarter humour and more intelligently structured, the film could have been longer perhaps with some subplots being explored more, the characters better developed and a little less time on some scenes, Gwyneth Paltrow was fun in the first but because of how Pepper was written she isn't anywhere near as much here and Jon Favreau's performance is rather annoying and unnecessary. Like the first film though the film looks great, with very stylish cinematography and editing, vivid location work and special effects that show a lot of time and effort and don't feel like over-load. The gadgets are also great fun and the Iron Man suit is still awesome. The music works very well, not quite as good as that of the first but it adds to the action without over-powering or bogging the pace down. The story while having a little too much going on and being over-familiar still does compel, is not too convoluted and it flows smoothly pacing-wise, and has a couple of note-worthy set pieces. There isn't a lot of action but what there is has thrills and fun aplenty, Vanko's entrance at the Grand Prix race is very dramatic and what follows is equally as thrilling and the climax while not as long as it could have been still outdoes that of the first. Favreau's direction still continues to be clever, with a mix of nostalgia for comic book fans and themes and such that would be currant by today's standard. The acting is fine, excepting Paltrow and Favreau, and there is great chemistry between them all. Robert Downey Jnr's performance is not quite a power-house but he still has the zany comic timing and the ability to give off the emotional depth needed for one of Marvel's most interesting and multi-faceted characters. Mickey Rourke is menacing and a lot of fun as Vanko, Scarlett Johansson shows how well she can play fearless and Sam Rockwell plays a real weasel and does so to hilarious and sleazy perfection. Don Cheadle also performs with authority.

","I went to go see this with a friend on Saturday night. Now, I heard the film from others that this a step or two below the original, but I went in with an open mind. By the time the movie was over, I was pleased. But then, after thinking about it more, this is a disappointment. The film is drastically different in pace. Honestly, it gets a bit of a bore for awhile, which never happened in the original. Sometimes, its just hard to take this film seriously as a superhero film. In my opinion, the overwhelming number of laughs and silliness in this film makes it hard to take seriously. There is a large list of new things in this sequel. First, we learn much more about Tony Stark's father than we ever did in the original. Its quite interesting. Jon Favreau has a much, much bigger role in this film than the original, and I absolutely loved his role in the film. We learn his character has a personality. The talented Don Cheadle replaces Terrence Howard as Rhodey,and I actually liked him better in the role. They both seem so different in the role. There's Scarlette Johansson as Black Widow. I was honestly disappointed with her role in the film. It was too small, I thought. Mickey Rourke is raw and sinister as Whiplash, the main villain, and its a perfect fit. He does an absolutely perfect Russian accent. Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer is a good fit for the most part, although it was hard for me to take his character seriously after awhile as a villain. Sometimes, it seems like all his character does is be funny. Samuel L. Jackson has a much bigger role in this film as Nick Fury (he had a credit ending scene in the original). In a way it succeeds over the original, but for the most part it doesn't. It's missing some of the excitement and originality that made the original a truly great achievement in film. This is quite a bit different from the first, and you may not like how different it is. I certainly didn't. Many new actors, and a whole different type of ballgame. There's a bit, I think, too much silliness in this film. But still, it'll do. Go see this. Its not as fun as the first, but its not as disappointing as Spider Man 3 was. And do be sure to stay after the credits if you're a fan of Marvel Comics. Make sure you notice Stan Lee's cameo in this as well. Its rather brilliant.

But the middle part just is really hard to sit through, and takes it's sweet time making their point, for no real reason. This was the biggest ""pure set up"" MCU by far, since it was setting up for the avengers initiative, and the film really bogs down when it deals with that. Which is a shame because I really enjoy the parts about Tony learning that his father really did respect Tony, and the fact that Tony basically decided he wanted to carry his fathers legacy on. Plus the idea of him dealing with his mortality was a very good twist. But overall, the party scene and the set up just bogs the film down a notch.

","In the noisy gaudy opening of ""Iron Man 2"" billionaire bad boy Tony Stark arrives at his Stark Expo in the Iron Man suit. Once removed from his body armor, Robert Downey Jr. as Tony admits, ""It's all about legacy."" Amidst the fun, high energy and stupid plot line, legacy does resonate as a poignant theme. I agree with A.O. Scott, that casting overcomes a lot in ""Iron Man 2""—I think I liked the movie more than he did. Robert Downey Jr. is awesome. And Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko provides what every hero story requires: a formidable villain. Director Jon Favreau is smart in never taking the movie too seriously, letting his actors morph and evolve. Favreau provides some spectacular action and visuals. The Monte Carlo Grand Prix where Vanko attacks Stark is stunning and heroic high drama.",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010
82,17 May 2010,cultfilmfan,10," Iron Man 2
","Iron Man 2 is based upon the comic book series created by Stan Lee, Don Heck, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby. The film is also a sequel to the 2008 film Iron Man. Basically, I figure that if you are reading this review and you are interested in seeing Iron Man 2, then you are probably a fan of the original film two years ago, the comic book series, or perhaps both. For that reason I am not going into a lengthy synopsis of the plot because the fans know what they are in for and they are the ones who are going to go and see this movie. The 2008 Iron Man film, I found to just be okay. I think the thing I really liked about it was Robert Downey Jr's performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man. He was narcissistic and arrogant and the performance was pulled off perfectly. However there was little else for me to be impressed upon in the first film because I found most of the other performances to be lacking character and emotion, the story really did not do anything for me and the action and special effects sequences went on too long and became a big part of the story, whereas I prefer more background on the characters, the hero and the villains. It was an okay film, but not great. I wasn't sure how I would like Iron Man 2 after my disappointment with the first outing of what is sure to become a series, but I actually liked Iron Man 2 better than the first film, a lot better. First of all, I found the acting a lot better in this one from everybody and the newcomers were really good also. Secondly the film gave us more of a back story to the characters and villain and I found it got more personal this second time around. Instead of just non stop action and explosions there were more scenes letting us know these characters better and I found that to be far superior and more interesting than non stop excitement from the special effects department. I also found this version to have more humour in it and there are certainly some smiles and chuckles coming your way and it made the film a lot more fun and entertaining for me than the first one. I think fans of the first one will likely be a bit disappointed with this version and the reviews tend to reflect this because it is not as action packed as the first film and I have also read complaints that people had of the writer and director trying to put too much into one two hour film. There is quite a bit going on this time around, but I did not find that the film suffered because of it. Instead, I found it gave us more to look at and think about and was a pleasant alternative to the non stop action scenes I mentioned above. The writing I also liked a lot better because it gave us more time with the characters, had a more interesting story and because some of the one liners and humour that I mentioned were in the film earlier. These last few years it seems that most superhero films have been compared to 2008's The Dark Knight because of what a great film it was and I would have to agree. I don't think you will get too many that will get the genre right and give us as interesting a look at it as in The Dark Knight, but we may yet still be surprised. Iron Man 2 while I am giving it the same rating as The Dark Knight, is not as good as The Dark Knight, but as a film in this genre, I do think it is one of the better ones. The Dark Knight was more gruesome, dark and disturbing while Iron Man 2 is definitely lighter and more kid friendly than The Dark Knight and is not as much into the development or psyches of the characters. Iron Man 2 knows this and more, or less just wants you to have a good time watching it and leave feeling entertained. For those goals Iron Man 2 succeeded and then some.",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010

","Loud migraine-inducing sequel which is made kind of like a two hour-plus music video with enough lights, cameras, and action to keep those with short attention spans happy for a few short moments. The movie takes off where its predecessor left off as Robert Downey, Jr. (in the titled role) has become a major international celebrity, but he has issues abound as the U.S. wants his weaponry for the obvious reasons. Meanwhile, arms producer/dealer Sam Rockwell and Russian recluse Mickey Rourke come into play as the antagonists. Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson make appearances to obviously set up ""Iron Man 3"" (I feel another major migraine coming on). And of course we have Gwyneth Paltrow (boring as usual as the love interest) and the usually dependable Don Cheadle (taking over for Terrence Howard who clearly knew better than to get caught in this franchise) who round out the main players in the all-star cast. Yes ""Iron Man"" makes a load of money at the box office, but critically there is not too much to talk about. Downey, Jr. seems content with playing the ham (think ""Tropic Thunder"" and ""Sherlock Holmes"") as his better work (""Chaplin"" and ""Good Night, and Good Luck."") seems a very distant memory. He has fun with the material and runs with it, in spite of the fact the substance is lacking in most cinematic areas. The screenplay is wishy-washy and Jon Favreau's (who also has a substantial acting role) direction does nothing to help in the end.

Granted, it's not quite as good as the first film. But, I still consider it a perfect movie by my standards. It has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and a perfect soundtrack. The story is a continuation after the first film.

Gwyneth Paltrow is great as Pepper, and Don Cheadle does a good job as Rhodey. To be honest, Don Cheadle is not as good as Terence Howard in this role. However, he does still work as a passable substitute as Rhodey. Scarlett Johansson joins the Marvel Cinematic Universe in this movie. She does a great job, and she puts out her second best performance in this one, out of all her roles in this franchise, with her best performance being in ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" (2014). Mickey Rourke does an excellent job as the villain; Ivan Vanko, and Sam Rockwell does a great job as Justin Hammer. The sets/locations are beautifully laid out, and work perfectly with the context of the film. Obviously, being 2010 when this film was released, the special effects are first rate. Finally, the soundtrack is well composed with the tone of this movie. Overall, this is a solid sequel, and every bit worth watching as the first movie.

126,3 July 2013,ironhorse_iv,6," Iron Man 2 has a bit of rust in its metal. It's a bit stiff, and unmoving. Still, it's a OK movie.
","Directed by once again Jon Favreau, Iron Man 2 in my opinion fault to live up to the original movie. Don't get me wrong, it's not awful movie. It was pretty OK for what it is. A popcorn flick. It just wasn't as good as the original, but hey it's still worth noting. Iron Man 2 was more a comedy than an action movie. Iron Man 2 starts out, with after the events of the first movie. Stark has just revealed his identity as Iron Man and is resisting calls by the United States government to hand over the technology. Meanwhile, in Russia, scientist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) has developed the same technology and built weapons of his own in order to seek revenge against Tony Stark (Robert Downing Jr.) as he believes that Stark stole his father's technology. Mickey Rouke as Ivan Vanko isn't a bad choice, but his character had little to no development. While the movie would love to point out that he is Whiplash from the comic books, in truth, he was on film a combination between Whiplash and the Crimson Dynamo (the original Anton Vanco). Both Whiplash and Crimson Dynamo in the comics wore more body armor than the guy in the movie. Most of the movie, you see him fail into everything he does. In no way, does I see him as a seriously threat to Iron Man. The movie could have made him sinister, but gladly use him as comedy with a running gag about getting a bird. Also in most of the film, we don't even see Iron Man in action. Tony Stark literally spent the last half of the movie in his basement making the ultimate suit to fight a ton of drones that went out like a candle in the wind. The thing that annoyed me about it was how his father's intention for this incredible, impossible to create super-sustainer type thing that will changed the world, is made in like 2 days by Tony Stark and is essentially used to replace a double-A battery in his chest. Trying not to spoil the whole movie, but I found the ending fights really disappointing. 23 minutes of action in 124 min film is too little for a blockbuster film, far less than Iron Man. Even the middle fight in the film is pretty much pointless as it waste time. It's remind me of the fighting scene in 1988's They Live where the two heroes duking it out for little to no reason just for comedy. I think all the comedy, hurt the story ark for Tony Stark's depression, alcoholic, and poisoning arch. It was never taken serious in many scenes. I was really hoping for 'Demon in a Bottle' like story arc. Sadly as long as Disney Marvel control the movies. There will never be a Demon in a Bottle storyline. Plus, I don't even think Monaco Grand Prix would have allow a clearly smashed, poison and untrained driver Tony Stark to drive a racing car in a race with other drivers. We came to see Iron Man, and what did we get 2 short action scenes, a depressing finale, and tons of Avengers references. So there were a lot of Easter Eggs in this movie, but I didn't get a trip on it as much as I hope. I mark a little bit, I have little interest in it. Back to the movie in hand, all actors and actresses did swell jobs, but the one that really broke out of its shell was Sam Rockwell as Rival defense contractor Justin Hammer. So let me see the bad guy in the first Iron Man was a white business tycoon, using an ethic minority as a cover for their own plot, the second was a white business tycoon using an ethnic minority as a cover for their own plot, and the third was a white business tycoon using an ethnic minority as a cover for their own plot, true inspiration there. Tony Stark's sidekick, Colonel James Rhodes went through a change, too. Terrence Howard got replaced by Don Cheadle. What I believe is the reason why, was because Terrence was overpaid for the first movie, they slashed his pay for the sequel drastically. Once Howard's agents were informed they were taken aback at the huge pay cut. He back down. The studio had always wanted Cheadle for the part, Howard says. It's weird that Colonel James Rhodes can control War Machine armor so quickly in this film, while it took a while for Tony Starks to get uses to being Iron Man in the first movie. Scarlett Johansson is sexy as Black Widow, but her character development wasn't there. She was pretty much in the movie because she's eye candy to the comic book fans. Talking about eye candy, Gwyneth Paltrow is just there to suck up screen time as Tony's love interest, Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts. Iron Man 2 had some bad dialogue. Characters often talked, but there was never an indication that a character might actually be listening. The conflict was forced and the plot loosely strung together, there was a lot of filler content than actual story. Even Robert Downing Jr. himself, said that this movie turned out not-so-good (paraphrased) mainly because Marvel had way too much control over it and deleted so many scenes which would've done much to. It seemed too bland to me personally, just pointless action, plot holes and dumb plot elements.

First off, I did like the character played by Mickey Rourke, which is Ivan Vanko (which seems to be a combination of the comic book characters Whiplash & Crimson Dynamo). But I felt that the details of the character were too underdeveloped. We got to see his some of his quirks and a little bit of back story which we thought was going to be spotlighted later on in the movie. Only to realize that the back story which felt like a teaser was not fully satisfied in the end anyway, and we walk off the movie not really having a full grasp what his character was all about. If the story wanted him to be a mysterious ""force of nature"" villain, the film should not have heavily teased on a back story in the first place, and should have gone with the fully mysterious psycho all the way. Basically his character was out to have vengeance on Stark, accusing his family of stealing an idea his (Vanko's) father pioneered. But in the end, it really was not clear what that ""stealing of idea"" was all about, or how Vanko's father was allegedly betrayed by the Stark family.",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010

","WOW! The director has crafted a super sequel that both dazzles the eyes and touches the heart. Much like Spider-Man 2, the truly remarkable special-effects of the new movie make it virtually impossible not to suspend one's disbelief. The effects actually beat Spider-Man 2. A lesser filmmaker would have been content to let the effects be the whole show, but Favreau gives us a movie populated by genuine characters and situations that make the film just as compelling in its quieter moments as it is during the big action scenes. IM2 combines the thrills of a big summer romp with the craftsmanship of a prestige studio picture. It's not simple popcorn fun although it certainly works in that capacity but it's as complex as its conflicted protagonist. It's a slickly engineered special-effects extravaganza with a saucy sense of humor that's well-acted and masterful at every turn. That's the kind of movie that I love to see one that isn't just dark to be dark or isn't just self-indulgent or overly serious for the sake of having some sort of false sense of gravitas. These Iron Man films are sweeping and even epic but, at the same time, they're tremendous popcorn entertainment. How many films can you say that about?

150,10 May 2010,Ziya90,4," An Iron Man film without any ""spark""
","Iron Man 2 focuses on humor, rather than action or excitement and this causes the movie to be mild. Iron Man 2 is entertaining, but entertainment comes from humor most of the time. Therefore, Iron Man 2 is more like a Saturday show, a Saturday night entertainment than an exciting super hero movie which has a lot of action. Probably it is because the director, Jon Favreau is a director who made comedy movies like Elf or Zathura and the screen writer is the writer of Tropic Thunder, then much (sometimes too much) humor is inevitable. This is what Iron Man 2 has. In addition, the execution and the story were better in the first installment. However, there is a more interesting villain played by great Mickey Rourke (even if even this character is mostly passive throughout) The villain of the first movie was a businessman as known. There are some great visuals, War Machine played by Don Cheadle is included in the team, there are nice cameos like Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johannson is really sexy. There are a few real wow moments and most of them are in The Grand Prix scene. It was the best scene of the movie to me. It could have been longer, but it is definitely satisfying. However, till the final part, you have to wait, if you want to see action. Probably, directors have started to believe that in an action movie, if there is less action, but more drama, the movie becomes more deep and more serious. Some people call this as Spider-Man 3 syndrome. Iron Man 2 suffers from this syndrome at times, in the middle part of the movie. It makes us feel like we watch a comedy drama and this is not surprising, because as I mentioned, the director of the movie is Jon Favreau who made comedy movies, played in comedy movies and the script writer of the movie is Justin Theroux who wrote a comedy before, Tropic Thunder. As for the characters, Robert Downey Junior is again the star of the movie, but he was more funny, cool and witty in the first movie. Natasha Romanoff played by Scarlett Johannson is passive most of the time, the operation scene was entertaining, but it is sad that this character consists of a few showy acts. Ivan Vanko (Rourke) is not a wasted character like Natasha Romanoff, but mostly he sits down and masterminds the chaos. Then, he is included in a disappointing and too short final fight (a few minutes) It starts and finishes in a trice. There are three action parts in the movie. The first one is The Grand Prix scene, in the second one, Iron Man and War Machine are included in a chaos (pretty long) and the third one is the final fight.

This could have been an exhilarating scene worth of The French Connection, but not much is made of it. It is not well explained what Whiplash has against Stark. Then comes Hammer, a dull corporate villain very similar to the dull corporate villain in the first film. Why can't Hollywood get beyond these off the peg evil capitalists? A fight with another Iron Man. Some secret agents. Then more Iron men. A lot of gimmicky effects. Nothing we haven't seen many times before.",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010

As hard as it may be to imagine, Iron Man 2 is even better than the original movie - and, you know, the first part was, along with Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, one of the best comic book films ever made. It does almost nothing wrong, and while it isn't 100% brilliant all the way, it's as good as any ""traditional"" comic book adaptation can be.

","Watching Iron Man 2 is kind of like observing a largely bloodless car crash while someone provides amusing narration. The plot is a wheeling mess, but the film is rescued by a lively, screwball script and some sharp improvisation from an ensemble of talented performers. Least amongst them is Mickey Rourke as the vengeful Ivan Vanko, in a performance that belongs to a far darker movie. Indeed, his scenes highlight the film's frequent lurches from breezy to black, which, combined with an apparent explosion at the on-set minor character-making factory, create an experience far less satisfying than its simple-minded predecessor – which itself was an ideal response to the ""darkening"" of comic book adaptations brought about by the Nolan brothers.",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010

The setup for the Avengers is now strongly in place as they spent a very large part of the movie harping the Avengers. It took almost two hours before we even get to see the suit do anything worth watching. They spent more time showcasing Scarlet fighting than they did with Iron Man. Robert Downey also proves that he just gets more irritating as he gets older. That and whoever said Jon Favreau and Gwynneth Paltrow are stars should be put on trial. The four main characters just do not go together and the fact that they took out the best performer from the first one - Terence, is quite sad.

I was worried going into Iron Man 2 that it wasn't going to live up to its hype and its prequel. But it did. The only criticism I have is that it is a bit slow for its type of movie. However, the content within the slower scenes is often filled with witty dialogue, low-key visual spectacles, and some confusing concepts. What I'm trying to get at is that Iron Man's audience is typically smaller children, and for them, I would say this movie is going to be a bit boring, for it lacks in the action department for the most part. But what may be its downfall box-office-wise is also its greatest accomplishment. Much like the Dark Knight, Iron Man 2 takes the superhero world and not-cheesily but convincingly conveys what it would be like in today's world. Not to mention we actually see Tony Stark go through a hero cycle in this one, without taking away his compulsive and loud personality.

R.D.J. was born to play Tony Stark and that fact shines through.

There were 2 AC/DC songs, which were only 30 second clips and fit the scenes they were in, plus I mean, directors like certain bands; just like Scorsese loves the Rolling Stones and puts tons of their tracks in his stuff, apparently Favreau likes AC/DC. Honestly, I didn't see Burger King anywhere in this movie and I can usually spot product placement instantly because it drives me crazy. It was great though is the bottom line. Even the change to Don Cheadle was fine and I loved first line of, ""I'm here, it's me, get over it,"" which obviously had a double-meaning. I loved all of it. Even Scarlett Johansson was good in it.

The best part was without a doubt the Monaco race track scene where Whiplash makes his entrance. That scene was, in one word, AMAZING!! Probably the greatest entrance of a villain in any superhero movie that I've seen. And the action that follows was equally brilliant! Unfortunately everything else ranged from merely okay to downright baaaad. Tony sitting in a donut was downright cringe-worthy as was Sam Jackson's lame line about exiting the donut. Hardy-harr-harr.. who the heck came up with that one? And the scene where Tony gets drunk and rowdy at the party immediately reminded me of the scene where Peter Parker does the same thing in SPIDER-MAN 3. Yuck!! And I agree with Roger Ebert - the finale was both overwhelming and underwhelming! Overwhelming because of all those hundreds of drones flying around blasting Iron Man with all the firepower they can muster. How the city stayed intact with all those huge fireballs left and right is beyond me. Much less how lucky can one Iron Man get against a slew of such machines. Even by comic-books standards this is really pushing it. But then we get to the showdown we've been waiting for - Iron Man vs. Whiplash! How long does that last? Oh a few measly seconds. Are you kidding me?! How can you create a climax which isn't even 1/4 as great as the racetrack scene. I wish they scrapped all those drones and gave us a proper ending with Iron Man vs. Whiplash. I mean this ending makes the ending in the original one (Iron Man vs. Iron Monger) look like a masterpiece in comparison.

Also, a technology that was pushed to be so incredible and impossible to replicate in the first installment is thrown around in this movie like if it's no more rare than an std. Lastly, similar to the first film, there were some huge plot holes. If a villain's weapons are a sort of lasso, wouldn't common sense tell you to just fire on him from outside of the lasso range? I would certainly think a genius like Tony Stark would be able to figure that out. Also, if you access the main computer and can reset the War Machine, why couldn't you also reset the others? Nonetheless, Robert Downey Jr. once again proves to be a top notch actor in Hollywood and the movie's transition to the ""Avengers"" adds some excitement to an otherwise quick and overrated ending.

Tony Starks is an eccentric, self-centered but genius multi-billionaire who builds Iron Man suit. Thiz time, he faces health issue and ready to confront another thread from his business rival, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) and mysterious villain Whiplash (Mickey Rourke). In the first Iron Man two years ago, I said to everyone that Tony Starks in that movie was too humanist, which was so wrong. Starks should appear more arrogant to present his original character (If you ask me thiz kind of stuff. Well, comic is my world. I recall when my dad bought me first Iron Man's issue from overseas). But at thiz sequel, Iron Man character really fills my expectation. Robert Downey Jr. acts amazingly well, improving his first appearance. The most powerful element in Iron Man's movies is simply Robert Downey Jr. himself. Mickey Rourke is our other attention after his breathtaking performance in ""The Wrestler"" (2008). He plays save for his villain character and it looks just fine. For the fight scene, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow is surprisingly kick ass. I don't know whether is the camera angle or the fight choreography that makes it so attractive, Johansson really left behind her girly image. Unfortunately, I don't like Nick Fury's character (Samuel L. Jackson) which is reconstructed from Nick Fury's original character. Other mentionable performances are Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle. The movie is directed by former Actor, Jon Favreau. His previous directing credits are ""Zathura: A Space Adventure"" (2005) and the comedy ""Elf"" (2003). It's almost very difficult to say thiz movie isn't a good one. Apparently it's an excellent and entertaining movie for everyone. Can't wait for another Starks Expo!

Stark is unwilling to give up his technology and weapons now the world knows he is Iron Man and arrogant in his beliefs that the rest of the world is nowhere near in designing a battle suit close to his. Expert research must have been made because because Robert Downey Jr is the personification of Stark and Iron Man. Each character has been perfectly cast for this movie. Mickey Rourke is excellent as the Russian hell bent on revenge a vendetta that goes back to his father being exiled from stark industries. Don Cheadle is now playing Rhodes and although I prefer Terrace Howard in this role Don Cheadle is worthy of the part as war machine. Reluctant to dulvage the secrets of his technology Stark is boastful and makes more enemies in fellow business man Justin Hammer. Overall the film is similar to the first and doesn't really bring nothing new to the table, but I'd say Rourke has more screen time than Jeff Bridges had in the first film and made for a more compelling villain.

The original Iron Man may have surpassed every original installment of any superhero film to date. Now, the sequel advances as well if not better than the previous great ""number 2's"" in history. Spider-Man 2, X2 and TDK all took the second films of the franchise to new heights. Iron Man 2 does the same and when you start at the remarkably high level that the first film achieved, that's saying something. It manages to deliver everything with the same style and integrity of the first film but adds more intensity and action. Again, like the original, Iron Man 2 is a film everyone can enjoy because it cares enough to deliver excellence on every front. The remarkable cast more than delivers and Cheadle was certainly an upgrade. The story itself is told in a masterful, crisp manner. It utilizes great dialogue that's witty, perfect use of humor yet again, advancement and complex characterization all the way through. Add the huge comic book style slugfests that were lacking from the first and you have what ten years from now people will be calling the best sequel of the decade. This is truly movie-making of the highest order and it easily deserves all the praise it has generated from both fans and critics alike. Long live the new king!

","Ah, summer blockbuster 2010 has started, and what bigger bang than with the sequel to 2008's smash hit, Iron Man? I really did enjoy the first Iron Man, it was exciting, action packed and different from other super hero movies that we see. Most super hero's hide themselves and stay very introverted in their ""normal human"" disguise, but Tony Stark was something different, he was so alive and colorful and admits pretty much off the bat to the world that he is Iron Man. Naturally he is going to get a lot of challengers in the world and we love to see him take them on as he knows how hot he is and doesn't hide it. So Iron Man 2 is the sequel that everyone who loved the first Iron Man had to see. I admit that I was extremely excited, this looked even better than the first Iron Man. So I got to see it this weekend and I have to say that my friends and I were a little disappointed.

","The thing with Iron Man 2 is that people inevitably tend to compare it to the first movie. And there's a minor problem with that. Iron Man - in most regions - released at just the right time. People were downright disappointed with the superhero genre and it appeared to be on the brink of demise after Spider-Man 3 and the X-Men films. Batman Begins seemed to have made a mark, but it was too fleeting and insignificant to be etched in people's memories. Then came Iron Man - it was the first decent superhero movie in ages. People loved it, it spread to engulf the Box Office earnings and bingo - there was a new, awesome superhero in town. Of course, after Iron Man, there was this little film you may have heard of - it was titled ""The Dark Knight."" THAT took the box office by storm. ",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010

","Iron Man 2 is definitely one of the most underrated sequels of the MCU. Robert Downey Jr returns once again as Tony Stark/Iron Man after revealing to the world that he is Iron Man, Tony must face new challenges such as the government thinking his suit is a dangerous weapon and wanting him to hand it over, finding a new replacement for the palladium core in his arc reactor that's keeping him alive while also poisoning him, and fighting a new enemy that ties into his family's legacy. Mickey Rourke stars as the villain Ivan Vanko/Whipflash and I highly think his villain definitely doesn't get the credit he deserves. The only problem I really have with his villain is the accent doesn't always hit its mark and he only has a couple of scenes of actual action that doesn't last long at all. Gwyneth Paltrow returns as Pepper Potts too as the new CEO of Stark Industries. Don Cheadle replaces Terrance Howard as Rhodey and now I can't imagine anybody, other than Don Cheadle portraying the character. The film also gives us a proper introduction to Samuel L Jackson's Nick Fury who is the the Director of Shield and Scarlett Johansson's Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow.

","Now first let's just get one thing out of the way, 'Iron man 2' is NOT as good as 'Iron Man'. That's not to say that 'Iron man 2' is not a good film...in fact - it's a very good film. There's a lot to enjoy about Iron man 2, there's enough action scenes (though some suffer from the blurry/shaky cam syndrome), there's a fairly consistent storyline separating those action scenes (some might find the film a little slow, I personally enjoyed all the talking), there's a great cast including returning cast members Downey Jr, Paltrow and Favreou (this time with a little more screen time) and new cast members including the legendary Mickey Rourke (Whip-lash) and the ultra sexy Scarlette Johanson (Black Widow) and then replacement cast member Don Cheadle (war-machine) stepping in for the absence of Terrance Howard. As usual, Robert Downey Jr was brilliant and his portrayal of Tony Stark is just as good in this film as it was in the first. It's obvious throughout the film that he is enjoying himself and he's truly amusing to watch and helps keep the film humorous. Don Cheadle did a fine job of taking over from Terrance Howard, though I don't think he was any better in the role of Rhodey/War-machine than Terrance in the first film. The best part about Iron man 2 is the casting of Mickey Rourke as the villain Ivan/whiplash as he is a great actor and truly lit up nearly every scene he was in. That been said I believe his part was a little under-written but I will get to that in a minute. Scarlette Johanson wasn't given much in the way of substance but it must be said that this is truly the most beautiful I have seen her look in any film! Red hair definitely works for her and she is ultra sexy when she's kickin' butt in her skin tight black spandex outfit! Ryan Reynold's is a lucky man!",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010

Had it not been for Jeff Bridges and Robert Downey junior, Iron Man would have been another Hulk. And by Hulk, I do not mean The Incredile. The improvement shown in Iron Man 2, by comparison, is like the improvement between X-Men and X2, only five times over. The difference being that X-Men had been 98 percent awesome to begin with. Maybe if this trajectory of improvement continues with the inevitable third Iron Man film (which in itself would be an awesome feat), it will be in the same ballpark as X2, or maybe even as awe-inspiringly brilliant as RoboCop, the exercise in suffering for the most wonderful art that the comic book Iron Man helped inspire. But I digress. The point I am trying to make here is that anyone who uses words like ""less fun"" as a put-down in context of reviewing a story like Iron Man 2 should be shot in order to lessen the pollution of our gene pool.

","An action packed depiction of the popular Marvel comic book character, Iron Man. In this film the main character, Tony Stark and the infamous Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) attempts to protect his Iron Man technology from the government and villain, Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke). Discovering his life threatening illness from palladium poisoning, Tony Stark must develop a technology to sustain his artificial heart, the arc reactor power source. After many failed attempts to discover a new life sustaining element fails, Tony Starks accepts his doom and appoints Pepper Potts (Gwenyth Paltrow) to assume Stark Industries as CEO. While Tony Stark falls into depression realizing his life will soon come to an end, he begins to behave erratically and irresponsibly. In the meantime, a Russian, Ivan Vanko has developed an arc reactor of his own that he will use in an attempt to take out Iron Man in revenge for his father's death. One of the main action scenes in the film occurs during a car race, when Ivan Vanko appears with is new found technology. Ivan has modified the arc reactor technology to create hand held whips that hold powerful destructive results. Despite Ivan Vanko's attempt to destroy him, Tony Starks used quick thinking and ingenuity to defeat the attempt. Ivan Vanko doesn't take the defeat lightly and joins Stark Industry's rival, Justin Hammer who has been contracted by the government to develop a war fight technology similar to Iron Man. The next action scene takes place at Tony Stark's Birthday Party, which he believes will be his last due to his illness. Intoxicated, Tony arrives in his Iron Man suit and the situation soon gets of control. Tony Stark's long time friend, Lt. Colonel James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) must bring Tony to his senses, leading to a battle between the two. Reaching a truce, the two soon find themselves in a battle with the newest army of drone technology unveiled at the Stark Expo by Justin Hammer. Ivan Vanko had a plan of his own for the introduction of his creation and configured the drone army for his full control to bring down Stark Industries and anyone who stood in his way. Iron Man, Tony Starks, and Lt. Colonel James Rhodes wearing Iron Man prototype, together, take down Ivan Vanko and the army of drones. Lt. Colonel James Rhodes takes down the last drone, while Iron Man save the girl (Pepper Potts) from self destructing drone. Landing on a city building roof top with his rescued Pepper Potts, Tony and Pepper share a kiss when Lt.

Seen from behind, Iron Man leaps out of an airplane, soaring through the air (pausing only to be inelegantly hit by a firework) to land before a cascade of screaming fans, backed by bikini clad dancing women, his armour removed to reveal grinning, gregarious millionaire industrialist Tony Stark. It should be exhilarating and sure to raise an immediate vast grin, and yet something feels... off. Perhaps the aerial descent or Stark's smirking on a revolving platform feel slightly too long, the pace seemingly compromised for the sake of matching AC/DC's ""Shoot to Thrill"" (an inclusion which, given their 'Greatest Hits' release titled after the film, feels gratuitous). Perhaps the sequence feels too forced to fully enjoy its excitement and offbeat humour.

","This film certainly must have been an anticipated one following the huge success of the first 'Iron Man'. And yet this is now commonly viewed as one of the weakest MCU films. Is it? Yeah kind of but it certainly isn't 'terrible'. Sure the film does suffer from a lack of focus and perhaps it tries a bit too hard to set up 'The Avengers' but it is still a pretty entertaining film throughout. Robert Downey Jr. is once again excellent as Tony Stark, even when the film makes Tony just a bit too damn arrogant. Admittedly the main villain, Whiplash, is a bit of a let-down, especially considering that he's played by Mickey Rourke, but Sam Rockwell makes up for it (for the most part) as the secondary villain, Justin Hammer. The action sequences are once again excellent, especially the finale, and the film once again maintains the MCU's trademark tone and atmosphere. In short, 'Iron Man 2' certainly isn't perfect and by no means 'better' than the first film. However, I will admit that when I first saw it, I actually did think it was better because I actually wasn't too big on the first film when I first saw it.

(Clash of the Titans does NOT count) It's Iron Man 2!! Key to the sequel, the return of Robert Downey, Junior, as Tony Stark. He is absolutely perfect as the brilliant billionaire man-child. Iron Man 2 picks up right where the first film left off, with Tony Stark taking ownership of Iron Man in a press conference. Of course, everyone wants a piece of him now. Congress wants him to testify about his actions and their global impact. Meantime, he still needs to perfect some of the technology, especially the parts that are keeping him alive. I was concerned (after watching trailers) that there would be too many villains and too much action that would take away from what I really loved in the first movie, which is Tony and his relationship to the important people in his life, Rhode-y and Pepper and others. I feared a Batman and Robin scenario. But no, Jon Favreau is back in the director's chair (and the driver's seat), and he remains true to the heart of what worked in Iron Man. In fact, we get more of Tony and Pepper, and even more of the story of Stark's origins. Mickey Rourke is great as the villain seeking vengeance. Even better (or worse), is Sam Rockwell, as Justin Hammer, a total tool who is a defense contractor and Stark Industries competitor. There are more fun guest shots and surprises. And, the action is fantastic, but it does not overwhelm the story or the characters. I give Iron Man 2 a 9 out of 10.

","We walked out of the cinema absolutely energized. I was amazed at how great a movie it was and how close it stayed to the source material. I still had some personal problems with the movie (such as i wanted to see more of the characters alcohol addiction to be fleshed out)but i soon thought ""thats what sequels are for"". I was pumped for Iron Man 2 and even though it didn't go in to the alcohol abuse that much anyway, i still sat through the whole 2 hours and came out wanting to see it again the next day. Iron Man 2 was not only a spectacular movie, but a superior sequel, and a fantastic comic book movie all in one. That is hard to come by. The Dark Knight was a spectacular movie, a mildly superior sequel but in terms of being a good comic book movie.... lets just say that Christopher Nolan seems like he's afraid of the fantasy nature of the source material. This review is going to look over those aspects and it may contain spoilers so i suggest that you should see the movie first before you read on. OK. The Movie opens right where the first film leaves off. Tony's Iron Man identity is now known to the world. His character arc in the first film took him from being an egotistical prick to a thought provoking hero. with the theme of how his actions have affected the world and what he is now going to do to rectify it. But as the film begins, he now is egotistical from soaking up the glory of being a hero, which brings him into social conflict with his aid Pepper Potts and close friend James Rhodes. Tony is also faced with having to deal with pressure to hand over his Iron Man armor to the government. If that wasn't enough, a rival industrialist named Justin Hammer is out to get his cut and a Russian ex-con Ivan Vanko is out with a personal vendetta against tony. It is very clear in this film that the stakes are far higher than they were in the first film. critics have argued that not everything in the film is tied up and the end. but that is simply not true. the film not only ties things up, but leaves possibilities open for not only future Iron Man films, but for future Avengers films. The Film is not a part 2, it is a continuation of the first film, and clearly continues the character arcs of Tony Stark, by bringing in the realization of Futurism to the character, which is one of if not the most important aspect of the Iron Man character. the film goes in to it just enough, so that it have a chance for future films to delve into further Iron man complexities. As well as this, the film continues to explore the social argument of how dangerous technology can be utilized. The Government wants his armor to use as a weapon of defense (of destruction) but Tony does not give it up because he is Iron Man. the suit isn't. Iron Man is the symbol of Futurism and consequence. It is not the gun, it is the arm that is the real hero. and whoever is behind the gun, will leave serious consequences (being the main thrust behind the antagonist) The Character arc that tony goes through, sees him first treat the role of Iron Man as an opportunity for attention, but over the film, he understands that is a symbol for a greater future as his father intended him to be. this is shown clearly in the film through the basic progression, as well as through the plot devises, (such as the arc technology killing him and he replaces it with a new energy source. this serves as a metaphor for the actual progression). Very few would argue that tony leaves this film completely undeveloped. the only reason anyone would not grasp the progression, is the fact that the film has a slightly lighter tone than the first one. Having a darker tone makes is easier for an audience to capture intelligence and maturity. But Iron Man 2 was able to deliver it in spades. There's no reason that you can't greatly develop a story if the tone is light. Iron Man proves it. If someone is arguing that it is stupid to have all the plot points that establish the Avengers and then doesn't use it by the end of the film, i say that they are hypocrites. nobody was nit-picking at The Lord of the Rings trilogy for foreshadowing things in the first films and only using them in the last.

364,3 May 2010,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,7," Bigger does indeed not always equal better
","I enjoyed almost all of this. It does have things that the first lacks, such as a villain presence, grander battles(and more armored participants in them, without getting excessive; some will argue that it's chasing first, combat second), and a greater amount of action(if a little of it is merely showing off) which, again, puts you right in the situation, as well as during flight(not as spectacular or breathtaking, not sure why). There is not a lot of tension in this, certain things don't pay off(this forgets that it's its own thing, not only a setup for Avengers) or have consequences, and there's not enough sense of ""danger"". The score, with a handful of exceptions, is a wallflower. I barely noticed it. This is missing the constant energy that its predecessor had, albeit it relatively seldom really slows down. There is not sufficient development for the plot(that never really grabs us) or the characters(of whom there are too many and they are not all granted motives, nor do they always make sense in what they do), and so much occurs in merely one film. Next to nothing moves ahead from where it was left off last time. The Black Widow gets to do a bit of awesome fighting(a little of it looks odd somehow, perhaps because of the angles), Johansson nails the femme fatale thing(looking *stunning* all the while) and if you think catsuits can't get any hotter, you *need* to see her in hers... but she(and a rockin' Jackson) serve no purpose, and they are not used for *anything* in this. Dialog can get a tad annoying, especially that of the overly dorky and awkward Rockwell(why is it popular to put weird roles in American flicks?). With that said, the humor is of the same tone and typically works, the lines are(often) as fast and as sharp, the acting is great, the FX are photo-realistic(thank you, ILM) and beautiful(without getting terribly indulgent), it is exciting and the editing and cinematography are excellent, this time, as well. If you want to be entertained, this will do the trick, if you expect a similar approach as what we got from Favreau before. This is not as good, however. There is plenty of mild violence, several instances of suggestive/skin-laden material and infrequent moderate language in this. I recommend this to any fan(and if you like the comics and the tying together of the franchise, stay after the credits). 7/10",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010

However, the dumbest part (as it is always the case with Hollywood) is their depiction of Russia and the Russian people. First of all, Moscow is not a some kind of a snowed in dumpster. These days it is more impressive than London or NY. It is what it is and if you are not sure about that, then buy yourself a plane ticket to Moscow and see for yourself. Secondly, why the heck those Hollywood producers and directors cannot afford to get even one actor who speaks realistic-sounding Russian language? They make stuff up in the dumbest way when it comes to things foreign! And it looks stupid and cheap. What is the story with their idea of the Russian names, too? All those ""Ivan Vanko"" names sound idiotically made-up. Also, how come that practically each and every actor who plays a Russian character does not even remotely resemble a Russian-type person? I mean, the good old Mickey Rourke is so overloaded with Botox that he does not even look like himself anymore! And who told those Hollywood people that a great inventor and a scientist would look and act like an ape and a very common thug of a completely indiscernible national origin? Do they meet a lot of ingenious and highly educated thug apes there in Hollywood? In short, the director of this movie did not bother one bit to make his production appear even reasonably realistic where it could use some realism.

","Well, if you ask me what is the greatest super hero movie of all time, i can tell you even for 1000 times, it's Iron man 2. Why? Because it's better than Iron Man 1. The better story line of Iron man 2 attracted me right from the first time i've seen the trailer. It is not just a movie for kids like the first one, it's more complicated yet simple enough for us to understand and not making our head hurt like The Dark Knight did when we try to figure out what the real meaning of everything is. In Iron man 2, everything is almost obvious but still, there is something and someone can make you say: Wow! I didn't expect that! The graphic, what can i say, Kick-Ass. All the Marks look better with all those gadgets and weapons. The HUD is cooler and Jarvis, well, he is one of the biggest hits of the movie. I was shocked when the first time i watched the movie, when Tony uses his basement aka laboratory. I was like: WTH? Is that near future? If that is then that really kicks Avatar's future ass. Iron man 2 doesn't need to be 3D. It hits very hard in 2D already. The graphic of Iron man 2 is a real masterpiece that you can not take your eyes off the screen once you started to watch. Mr. Robert Downey Jr. comes back impressively. Together with Gwyneth, they create the funniest couple in a super hero movie. Samuel and Scarlett didn't exceptional job although they didn't really play big parts. Sam Rockwell still rocks with his moves, he may be a bit annoying but that is what we are looking for, an annoying and jealous Justin Hammer. Don Cheadle, yeah, i saw how he managed to be Terrence Howard, not very good but still a great effort. Thanks to the War Machine suit, his face is limited behind the mask and the movie is safe.Phew! Some would say Iron man 2 is boring, he is invincible. Yeah, so? Doesn't the world need a perfect super hero, rather than a man of steel who's scared by Cryptonite, rather than a dark knight who is affected badly by emotions and decisions that never had his real life. Tony Stark is a typical super hero. He showed the world who he is, yeah, he can do that, because he the coolest and the strongest. The world needs him, a perfect hero. It's 100% that he kicks all villains ass, it's not a rated R movie, not a super block buster movie but has a great crew. Whoever you are, just try Iron man 2 for once.

No one really expected a film based on a character the general public knew next to nothing about to do really well, especially not in the same year as a certain film directed by Christopher Nolan and starring the late Heath Ledger was also due to be released. And yet the film was highly successful, critically and commercially, propelled Robert Downey Jr. to new heights of stardom and pretty much began the renaissance where Marvel superhero films were concerned. But perhaps one of the best things about the first film (apart from the well-structured plot, the excellent dialogue, the brilliant acting etc.) was the cliffhanger ending of Tony Stark revealing his identity as Iron Man to the world! RDJ's line 'I am Iron Man' plainly spoken in a matter-of-fact tone itself, perhaps more than anything else, set the momentum for the high expectations everyone had of the sequel. And the trailers, when they came, set expectations even higher...and then when the film came out...it didn't live up to a lot of those expectations.

So the motive is revenge. Are you confused yet? So many things going on. Stark is dying from radioactive poisoning. The government wants to create the ultimate drone soldier and a competing corporation wants to steal the contract from Stark Industries. It plays a little like ""Short Circuit"" meets ""Robocop 2"" with a dash of tin-can ""Cylons"" mixed in. Very cartoonish, which, of course, leads to a wonderful mindless climax with dozens of exploding evil drones and tons of action. (Kids ages 6 to 12 will love it.) People running for their lives from a set that looks like Epcot's ""World Showcase"" but isn't. The best sequence occurs far earlier in the film at a Monte Carlo race from Hell with race cars sliced in two by ""Vanko"" with his pulsating ""laser whip"". It all left me with a big headache. Scarlett Johansson, as ""Black Widow/Natasha"" ""kicks butt"" and she has better moves than the Iron Men. (Yes, there are 2 Iron Men plus villain makes 3.)

The whole Avengers thing is deftly handled. I actually find that whole concept pretty funny, because it banks on the fact that all the other Marvel franchises are going to be just as successful as this one when we already know that they won't be (see the last Hulk movie - are they going to have to reboot it again in order to work it into the Avengers movie?).

Gwyneth Paltrow, while not as good an actress as she was a decade ago, holds her own nicely opposite Downey. Don Cheadle replaces Terrence Howard as Lt. Col. James Rhodes. Both are strong performers, but, for sentimental reasons (i.e., Boogie Nights), I prefer Cheadle. The sequel adds Sam Rockwell as Tony Stark's chief rival. Mickey Rourke is a Russian physicist/gangster who comes after Stark. Sam Jackson is in the sequel a lot more (his only appearance in the original was post-credits). Scarlett Johansson plays a mysterious intern hired by Paltrow. She clearly has some secrets. And Jon Favreau himself is great as Stark's bodyguard (well, Iron Man doesn't really need a bodyguard, I suppose; maybe Happy Hogan is his assistant?). Favreau is a pretty good director. I especially like the way he integrates humor into the film without going overboard with it. Downey's subtle hilarity helps a lot in that respect, but there's a spirit of improv to a lot of the dialogue that's just a lot of fun. Justin Theroux, whom you may remember as an actor in Mulholland Dr., actually wrote the screenplay for the sequel (his only previous screenplay being Tropic Thunder, which netted Robert Downey Jr. an Oscar nomination), so he gets a lot of credit for keeping it all together. The film doesn't actually contain a ton of action sequences - only three really big ones (and they all deliver), so it's quite impressive how entertaining the film is from beginning to end.",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010

","This sequel that has been overly hyped didn't meet it's expectations of how great it was going to be, but it's still a passable sequel. It tries to be intelligent but it felt like there was just a tad bit too much talking. Although I liked the debating scene in Washing D.C. And this movie just didn't flow cleverly like the first one did. It should have carried the tone of the first half of the movie although it wasn't all that great with the second half. Tony Stark still has the egotistical and wisecracking personality like the fist Iron Man movie but he comes off as an asshole in this. Tony Stark has been a bit of a asshole that tries to enhance or always tries to be on top even in the comic books. But his character in this just wasn't all that likable. In the first Iron Man movie Tony Stark had a decent blend of being a guy with a heart and being a bit of an asshole. I guess now his ego has skyrocketed way more after becoming Iron Man. The main villain Whiplash played by Mickey Rourke is a more developed villain than the previous one but lacked that interesting appeal that grabs the attention like what Jeff Bridges did. This also has more action going for it compared to the previous movie and it sweet to watch but it just lacked the soul compared to the first movie. Maybe cause the plot isn't integrated very well into the action sequences, it's done alright but not as well as the first one. The plot about the alter-ego leading the way for conflicts to start for a normal life in a Genius Billionaire Tony Stark daily lifestyle is done alright but nothing groundbreaking. Especially with great power comes a lot of responsibilities that he has to deal with. This isn't really a superhero movie that the kids will enjoy as much as the adults, simply because sometimes it has way too much talking going on. And some of the scenarios just doesn't make any sense, not because it's implausible but it just doesn't make any sense.

","9 May 2010. This is ROBOCOP (1987) on steroids. This movie is action packed with the requisite theater-vibrating sound effects along with a high-thrills and a SPIDERMAN (2002) personal backstory that lends a nice balance to this summer blockbuster. A few weaknesses persist that take this movie down a notch - a rather sedate opening sequence that also leads to a underdeveloped, stereotypical antagonist, and an Ironman lead-in that somehow ends up on stage without revealing any remarkable landing sequence. There's the amazing, but over-the-top sedan scene on the Monaco raceway. The movie has a superb martial arts sequence in the league of BOURNE IDENTITY (2002) much more enthralling than THE DARK KNIGHT'S (2008) fight sequences. This sequel, like SPIDERMAN 2 (2004) extends the personal drama and confronts the lingering father-son relational bitterness (though not even its resolution was perhaps underdeveloped as well). IRON MAN 2 (2010) presents a rather fascinating dynamic of two villains, both well played by Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell (who had an amazing starring role in the relatively obscure movie MOON, 2009). The narcissistic charisma of Ironman and the intimate focus on terminal death issues were well played out in the movie. The climax while explosive, failed to reach the heights of THE DARK KNIGHT (2008) nor the personal intimate and emotional intensity of BOURNE IDENTITY (2002), THE BOURNE SUPREMACY (2004). Interestingly, IRONMAN 2 is able to avoid the crass, overt sexual titillating excuse, though there is plenty of insinuations. Overall, IRONMAN 2 is blockbuster, summer lead-in entertainment that has both the riveting emotional dilemma of a hero and feel-good entertainment.",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010

The furthering of Stark's character arc is half-baked too. While the Part One offered an intelligent glimpse at naive weapons designer turned selfless philanthropist, here Stark is battling his ego, and it is only mildly interesting to watch him grow humble as opposed to completely change his outlook on life as in Part One.

Robert Downey Jr. was in top form quipping all about, and the source material seemed to be given a great deal of respect. The sequel is not bad by no means. It has the action, a haggard Robert Downey quipping(but with a lot less zing), beautiful Scarlett Johannson, and a mega-lode of special effects. Perhaps too much in that area for me. What was supposed to be presented on the screen as reality - at least for me - was detracted by the over-use of CGI, explosions, and a throw-it-all-at-you ending. The movie picks up sort of where the first one left off, and, yes, it is laying the groundwork for The Avengers release. Like I said, I didn't dislike the movie but left viewing it somewhat disappointed. Sorry, I cannot help how I feel when watching a film sometimes. Maybe I need to see it again. For now, I liked Johansson(a lot!), Downey at times, and thought Mickey Rourke was okay - liked the Monte Carlo scene best. Kate Mara is aboard and so is Samuel Jackson. Nice to see Gary Shandling has a role. He was humorous - at times.John Slattery does a nice job playing Howard stark in some flashback scenes.",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010

","Robert Downey Jr. is back as Tony Stark and alter ego (sort of) Iron Man in the highly anticipated sequel to the 2008 hit, Iron Man. In Iron Man 2, billionaire Tony Stark must contend with fatal issues involving the government, his own friends, competition, and new enemies due to his superhero alter ego Iron Man. Iron Man starts with our main villain, Ivan (a very vengeful Mickey Rourke), preparing to get his revenge on the whole Stark family for allegedly ripping off his dead father's ideas of post-modern technology and the Iron Man concept. Meanwhile, Tony Stark reveals he is Iron Man, and that his technology is so advanced that it will take years for other countries to harness the power and technology to match Iron Man. Of course, he is wrong. Iron Man 2 really soars when Robert Downey Jr. is on screen. He really makes Tony Stark his own, because Downey Jr. is a lot like Tony Stark: funny, charming, and totally narcissistic. This isn't a jab at Robert Downey Jr. I have been a big fan of his for a long time, way before Iron Man was around. Gwyneth Paltrow is in her usual top form, as she plays Tony's on- again, off-again love interest. As far as the villains go, Mickey Rourke is good enough. He is tattooed and ripped to the tee, and is memorable. He is very hard to understand though, and the Russian accent is forced. It's really not a huge problem though, because his character doesn't do a lot of talking. That leads me to villain number 2, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), who talks too much. Justin Hammer, who is sick of having a second-rate company compared to Stark Inc, teams up with Ivan to take Stark down. Sam Rockwell's performance was a lot like Downey's, but comes off as annoying, rather than funny. He ends up being a second-rate villain, a lot like Topher Grace was in Spiderman 3. The main problem with Iron Man 2, is that it seems like it is just a whole bunch of parts of a movie, but doesn't come together as one. It isn't nearly as refreshing as Iron Man was, nor is it really anything new. Iron Man 2 is gold when Robert Downey Jr. is working his magic, and when he suits up for the visually amazing action scenes. And yet, Stark doesn't suit up as much as we'd like, and that birthday party scene shouldn't even count. That scene was neither funny nor necessary, and should have been cut out. Another problem is the Avengers sub-plot. Yes we get it, there will be an Avengers movie, but you don't have to have Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johansson hogging screen time, when Tony Stark has other things he should be doing. Overall, Iron Man 2 is an okay sequel. It is not as good as Iron Man but if you were a fan of the first one, I can't see you hating this one at all. The inevitable Iron Man 3 really needs to have a better script and fall back onto its strengths though. Those strengths being Robert Downey Jr. and the originality that this genre desperately needs.",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010

","There are plenty of rough spots to iron out in ""Iron Man 2"". I did not feel the super charismatic powers in this one as I did in the original. Not to say that the sequel was a total disaster, but there were some narrative elements that Director Jon Favreau and especially actor-turned-screenwriter Justin Theroux should have unwrinkled in this mediocre sequel. In this ironic chapter, Tony Stark (of course Iron Man himself) becomes a narcissist iron-tuned man machine in arrogantly telling the world that his iron weaponry is the country's main armed defense and they are helpless without him. Starks then faces new super challenges in being a identity-revealed super hero: competitive corporations try to develop their own ironisque design suits, his mechanical heart is causing his blood toxic level to rise, he faces pressure from a jealous U.S. Senator, is obsessed in pursuing his deceased father's vision to become a reality, and delegates his CEO executive powers of Starks Enterprises to his right-hand woman Pepper Potts. Of course, Iron Man does encounter new enemies. Those would come in the form of an avenging Russian named Ivan Vanco, who has constructed a miniaturized arc reactor of his own including whip-like attachments harnessing the electrical energy. And also the garrulous & obnoxious Justin Hammer, a CEO corporate rival who desperately tries to hammer out a super iron suit of his own to no avail. Starks' BFF Lt. Colonel James Rhodes does return in this installment in taking the high road on becoming an armed super hero of his own, in order to help Iron Man not to dive into a colossal downfall. We also get some spy eye-candy in this one with the gorgeous Natalie Rushman, Starks new assistant who may or may not be the Rush woman she claims to be; and there just might be another limelight to her persona. Robert Downey Jr. was again stellar as Starks/Iron Man, so I am down with him still playing the armed superhero. Gwyneth Paltrow as Potts lost some of that Potts' thespian high that she embodied in the first installment. Mickey Rourke did kind of wrestle with his underdeveloped role as Vanco. The undervalued Sam Rockwell did rock once more in the acting arena with his performance as the determined Hammer. I felt kind of cheated with Don Cheadle's flat work as Rhodes; Terrence Howard was more divine in the Rhodes role in the predecessor. I was elated that there was a casting trip to Johannsonburg by having the stunning Scarlett Johansson portray Natalie Rushman/Black Widow. I do credit Favreau for enterprising some challenging direction to ""Iron Man 2"", but this ""just in"", Justin Theroux's immensely chatty screenplay was too much talk and not enough creative bite. There were way too many mumbling elongated conversations in ""Iron Man 2"" which provided a mechanical restlessness in its viewing audience.

","My memories of the original ""Iron Man"" are generally limited to the notion that I had a good time watching it, and that, for a big-screen translation of a popular comic-book property, it was more cohesive and clever (and boasting a far finer cast) than its less-successful Marvel brethren (think ""The Punisher"" and ""Incredible Hulk""). While it didn't come close to touching ""The Dark Knight"" (which is probably an unfair comparison for two wildly different superheroes), it was entertaining in a breezy, thrilling manner that got good mileage out of Robert Downey Jr.'s infectious, snarky charisma. ""Iron Man 2"" continues this cycle with consistent results: the action sequences are frantic and fast-paced without being incoherent; the cast well-chosen (with a barnstorming Mickey Rourke stealing the show); and the integration of CGI convincingly rendered. As both a continuation of the plot threads and character arcs in the original and as a standalone film, ""Iron Man 2"" is a solid, consistently entertaining effort that cements one-time indie darling Jon Favreau (who wrote and starred in the cult classic ""Swingers"") as the directorial antithesis of Michael Bay's sloppy, migraine-inducing action style. That being said, there is a nagging sense of lack within the proceedings, as though screenwriter Justin Theroux (""Tropic Thunder""), in an attempt to outdo the original, crammed in as many characters and subplots as possible simply to keep the film busy; while there are many Howard Hawks-ian comedic exchanges that recall the screwball comedies of the 1940s and '50s (many belonging to Downey and Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts), there are just as many characters who feel less than necessary (despite their considerable appeal, Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johansson don't have much bearing on the film's outcome). If ""Iron Man 2"" is flawed for this reason alone, then that still makes it better (and certainly more ambitious) than most of this summer's blockbuster fodder.",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010

","Overall a huge disappointment, but still a rather exciting and exhilarating ride. The main problem with Iron Man 2 is that it does too much in the most complicated of ways and yet misses obvious ways to tie the plot together in a more condensed form. Tony Stark is dying because of his Iron Man suit. Ivan Vanko wants revenge on Stark because Stark's father ran his father out of the country and stole his idea. The American government wants the Iron Man suit. These are the main three plots going down. After a great set-up the film is all ready to roar into action when SUDDENLY the antagonists spend the second act delegating their work. The American government hires Justin Hammer to build a suit, Hammer can't build a suit, Hammer springs Vanko from prison etc. And it goes on. The villains all need someone else to do a part of their plan which makes for a lot of talk and not a lot of action. Keep in mind, all this is going on without any involvement from Stark/Iron Man. He's searching for some unknown element to stop his suit from killing him, whilst setting up a spin-off (The Avengers). I appreciate what Marvel are trying to do, but the film was all foreplay and then a quick handjob. Couldn't Vanko have had some clues towards Tony's cure?

In the Movie they used him as a smooth guy who wants vengeance on the STARK family, Mickey did a well done expression with him, but he was still a bad a** too.

IT Just had a great cast. including Pepperpotts. The thing I Wish was a little longer was the end battle between The 3.

In a sense, IRON MAN 2 followed the same formula that made the first film great. Unfortunately, they followed it so closely that it felt as if they didn't bring anything new to the mix. The film begins about six months after the first left off, with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) publicly admitting his role as Iron Man. News reaches Russia where Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), whose father originally aided Stark's father in his creation of the arc reactor, becomes enraged as his father dies in poverty.

These two stories, every other revenge movies always have. I am surprised how someone could choose such cliché story for a Comic Book Hero. We knew everything what's going to happened Next. Robert Downey Jr.'s wit and wicked portrayal of Iron man is really enjoyable and this time Don cheadle also rightly stand next to him. Gwyneth Paltrow as usual did a good job. Scarlett Johansson looked Hot as ever and she looked good thin seems like she shed some pounds for this role. Mickey Rourke was a cool villain and Sam Rockwell was truly amazing as devious enemy.

","I saw this in the theatre and I should have known better to set any expectations, but since Downey, Favreau, and the previous installment doing Shellhead some justice, I relented and set those expectations. Not high, but they were set optimistically. OK, so I know Cheadle replaced Howard and that was a decision that wasn't for the best. Cheadle is usually dependable in his own way. But Howard was actually plausible and sold you that they were friends. Cheadle didn't bring that to his role. Rourke, In my opinion took the dramatic, emotional stake that should have been Stark's with an ever increasing personal stake or investment with each sequel that doesn't have to always be Pepper Potts. I mean, is that all he actually cares about ? I know she's the unattainable love interest and the one person whom Stark can't get into the sack. But she was bait for Stane in the first, and now for Anton Vanko's droid attack. Come on Justin Theroux. This is why you make the big bucks. This isn't a plot driven movie since it just unfolds as it comes to Stark's realization. But it doesn't offer much for character driven either. When Stark starts gets drunk at his party, you feel they're gonna do an homage to the ""Demon in a Bottle"" storyline. But nope. Perfect chance to dive into a moment in Stark's fallibility and character development outside the seemingly ""Uh, gotta fight the Mandarin again."" I felt the action scenes were treated with less reverence than the first and added to satiate action fans. But the fight scene at Monaco was over before it really began, the battle with Cheadle during the party was trying to be funny while also adding humor, and the face-off with Vanko was too un-fulfilling. I felt it was all over waaay too quick. You know it isn't that good of a ""movie"" when even Downey is quoted as saying how much of a letdown it is. Furthermore, there wasn't much if any, semblance of an arc for Stark like his realization in the first that he was irresponsible and went about to rectify that character defect.

That is the one reason people are coming to see this movie. To me the plot in an action movie is always secondary. Since in this case the focus was on the story I do have to say something about it. Well,that is going to be difficult. There is no coherent plot to speak of. And as a result it is far less compelling than it could have been. The villain (Mickey Rourke) isn't bad ass enough to actually be taken as a serious threat. The introduction of Black Widow showed promise,but ultimately was more used as window dressing.

","It's easy to write off ""Iron Man 2"" as easy enjoyment, but let's look at what we have here: Mickey Rourke plays the blandest Russian villain imaginable; Robert Downey Jr. pulls off the role of Tony Stark as well as last time, but the bickering between him and Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper gets worn thin pretty quickly; Scarlett Johansson shows up supposedly to introduce romantic strain between Stark and Pepper, but it soon becomes apparent that she is more there for the audience to ogle at (which I did). Saddest of all, the most interesting part of the movie was the Avengers subplot, which in the end really has no influence in the realm of the movie. And the discovery of Thor's Hammer at the end of the closing credits reveals all - ""Iron Man 2"" really isn't much more than a mediary between the (deserved) hype of the first ""Iron Man"" and the hype of the upcoming ""Thor"" movie.

591,12 May 2010,Astralan,6," How much cheaper it could have been without the first 90 minutes
","The surprising thing about the initial movie release of Iron Man was that not only was there action, but thought and intrigue. There was almost something in the movie for everyone simply because wading through the scenes you didn't find interesting were blocked well and didn't run on and get you impatient. Not so with this new entry. I was hoping that it would have gone more the way Spider Man II went: More plot for morons, more build to romance, enough head on action to appease the geek. This for me did not happen. Now granted, I don't claim to be an expert in movies. I don't know the intimate histories of all the stars and starlets out there, or the screen writers, nor the directors or producers much more than the average Joe but I'm not all that willing to accept less than what was offered in a preceding film. Even though the same constellation was involved with this production it just didn't quite do it for me. I was disappointed. Here's why: The first 90 minutes of this film were vague and uninvolved. You may argue the fact, but to this reviewer it seemed that the entire movie was during the last 30 minutes when good versus evil clashed in a way we hope it would. I have seen it twice, and the second viewing confirmed what I couldn't pinpoint in my first watch: The movie was boring for the most part. Nick Fury was a ""meh"" (though Jackson still is just right for this part); Scarlett at her best was image happy. The whole sequence with her kicking her way through the Hammer corporation I couldn't decide was her stand in, or CGI, or just the actress. I saw this in a DLP theater and the way her hair flew around the screen just didn't look justifiable (even though the leather suit did justice to her makeover); Pepper seemed almost borderline personality disorder - mood-swings were almost menopausal. Even the Iron Man seemed a little over the top even at his worst. The one thing that was almost perfect was Rourke's portrayal of Ivan. He is the perfect ugly bad guy as we have come to expect since his role in Sin City. For the most part to me, the whole thing seemed like it was over acted. Hence, when action commenced, it all seemed to fall in place. Still, there are redeeming graces that occur. The filming and coloration are up to par, the enhanced Iron Man effects appreciated. Thanks to CGI, it was still a great theater experience. I don't know how it will fare on DVD. I think over the coming weeks, the viewing of this movie will drop significantly from opening day, just the opposite of ""How To Train Your Dragon"", which is doing really well still. It's not that this movie was a total waste, it is just expectations were not met in this reviewers opinion. Sorry guys.",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010

","I know iron man 2 is the most hated iron man film. Yes, it has its share of flaws. The first iron man was simple but powerful. Whereas in iron man 2 the story and screenplay was ordinary. Plus I didn't like the character of Pepper Potts in this film because she was very annoying and being insensitive towards Tony. I liked her in the first and third part. Also the ending could have been better. But if you ignore these shortcomings, iron man 2 is very enjoyable film.
It has RDJ who is as cool as ever. Then you have Mickey Rourke as villain whiplash who was also good but his character could have been better. Then there was Scarlett Johansson as black widow making her debut in MCU, who was hot as well as badass. And there is don cheadle who replaces Terrence Howard as Rhodey. I don't know whether he was better than Terrence Howard but I liked him. Terrence Howard unfortunately missed the opportunity of wearing the war machine suit. But the scene was not appropriate were Rhodes wear the war machine suit for the first time. That birthday party scene was hilarious. And I loved the action scenes especially where tony wears his portable suit.
Like spiderman 3, iron man 2 also got messed up with studio interference. Jon favreau was pissed up for rewriting the script multiple times. He was forced to include shield characters as a buildup for the upcoming avengers film. But that was affecting the main story. That's why favreau refused to direct iron man 3.

But the 2nd part had too much talking and less action. Only Quentin Tarantino has the art of making a movie on the subject of talking ..for e.g. Pulp Fiction ,Inglourious Basterds. Anyways ...the point is that its a summer action blockbuster..so we expect a lot of fire works..

","When I saw first Iron Man back in 08' I was very pleased with the experience. Robert Dwoney Jr was a fresh revelation as a Tony Stark/Iron Man witty,clever,slick pretentious guy with all the money in the world. His relationship with Gwyneth Paltrow's character was full of chemistry and it was joy to see them playing off of each other. Add to this couple of great cgi and sound effects here and there, simple script with plain anti war message, and you have yourself great blockbuster summer flick. This time around, like in majority of sequels we get all the same, but in multiple proportions in different variations, and like in most of the cases there is almost nothing really new here. Downey Jr. is great again, there is no reason of course to improve on that in any way, also we get to see Mickey Rourke as one of the villains, and I'd say that the way he underplays his character, making him very ominous, mysterious man is most intriguing addition to the formula, as we anticipate while watching the movie for him to come up on screen more often. We get also Scarlet Johannson as a sexy counter proposal to Paltrow's character for Tony's affection, Sam Rockwell as Stark's old rival, and even Sam Jackson lands a bigger(yet very cartoonish) part here. Nevertheless the movie feels juvenile, as despite very intense approach from Rourke(who went to Russia for preparation on his part), we see actions that feel like taken out from video game, which will not be very much exciting for anyone above 15 years old mark. When you see Don Cheadle's face(another great actor on the payroll here-taking over Terrence Howard's part)in the Iron Man style suite batteling with Tony Stark dozens of robots, you don't think about how great he was in ""Hotel Rwanda"", you think Power Rangers.",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010

The story was a little rushed. The ending was resolved too quick at the end. You were kind of hoping for more of an epic battle, but you didn't get it. Now all the characters and the visual effects were amazing. So I give credit for that. But I just don't want them to make the same mistake as the Spider-Man movies; having them go slowly downhill. So the nerds out there, the movie had many references to the Avengers which is very exciting. Robert Downey Jr. was still the same quirky Stark. Gwyneth Paltrow seemed a little off as Pepper though. Don Cheadle was an excellent replacement from Terrance Howard for Rhodey. Not that Howard is a bad actor, it just seems like Cheadle wanted it more. Scarlett Johansson was a great Black Widow. She had the looks and the moves. Of course Samuel L. Jackson was good as Nick Fury. Then the two villains were Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke. Rockwell was pretty good. I really wish there was more of Rourke though. He is just 100% creepy and mean looking.

Sure, there's a big difference between this one and the first, but Favreau manages to further set up the MCU and simultaneously deliver a fun experience.

Other great cast additions include Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer and Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff (who's entry in this film was vital for the characters' success in the larger MCU). While the villain is much more 'comic-book' this time around, Mickey Rourke is very entertaining in the role and his motivations are clear.

Oh, yeah, Tony was drunk, so I guess that explains why he lost. And why his friend is able to control the other suit perfectly (?)). They tried to put a bit of more depth into the story and Tony's relation with his late father, which is something that goes in the right direction, regardless how shallow it still looks. Nevertheless, this is just another Hollywood super-production for teenagers and die-hard Iron Man fans I guess (if they liked the horrible first movie, I'm sure they'd love this one).

","I watched Iron man 2 with great expectations as i had recently watched the first Iron man on DVD and it had pleasantly surprised me. After watching this one, i felt that this movie too falls in the list of movies following the trend ...see it....enjoy it....forget it. Though it did not turn up as disappointing as some of the recent superhero sequels are but it is not half as good as the earlier Iron man edition. Nevertheless this is a decent watch mainly due to RDJ who portrays the superhero with effortless ease and incredible charm. But the movie as a whole does not offer anything very different from the usual summer blockbuster. The wit and charm of its prequel are clearly missing. Action scenes are relatively less and the characteristic one liners are few and far between. Still it has a lot of ""guilty pleasure""....which is a must for any movie of this genre. The Monaco race sequence episode has been done brilliantly and is the highpoint of the movie. Among the star cast Scarlett Johanson is a welcome change and Paltrow too got more screen time than the previous edition. Cheadle and Samuel Jackson haven't got much scope. But as stated earlier the movie belongs to RDJ who should increase his fan base after this movie. RDJ has an great screen presence and had lit up some of scenes by his charisma.

","The first one was a revelation! i thought it would be hard to see a comic book adaptation which would be a class apart, until Dark Knight and Iron Man changed that perception, Batman Begins was great but more of a build up to the great sequel! I certainly hoped so for the Iron Man franchise too.Guess that was not to be!I don't want to brush away this installment as unwatchable or anything like that but hey this one gets nowhere close to Iron Man 1. well being a comic-book junkie myself, i feel this movie as a stand alone is good enough maybe but as compared to its predecessor it does not do justice! What went wrong then?!! well the movie is good, maybe even great at some parts but the sum of it isn't. I think Mr.Favreau took too many things and tried to stuff all of it into one movie, nice touch in adding Nick Fury and references to other characters from parallel Marvel universes(Thor,Cap. America) but i think overall the movie was too Superhero studded for its own good. Robert Downey jr. is great as usual but the script makes him look silly at times!!( He seems carried away by the tongue in cheek side too often) There was way too much emphasis on the comic element of his character than i deem preferable in Iron Man or Tony Stark for that matter. Poor Gwyneth Paltrow has to be content playing just Stark's arm candy yet again! Scarlett Johansson looks hot in her leather tights as Natasha Rumanoff but her character is very vaguely fleshed out! As for the War Machine character, it was such a huge letdown i don't know where to begin. Firstly why on earth would they replace Terrence Howard with Don Cheadle!!! well i know Howard cant raise a candle to Cheadle in the acting department... but hey this is an action adventure we're talking about, and Howard looked good in Iron Man!I mean Don Cheadle as an action hero?? i doubt if there are many takers for that! I read somewhere that even Howard doesn't have a clue what happened?!!And the way the guy just steps into the Cybernetic guided armor-suit and flies off!! where the hell did he get trained for that, i guess in the Army?!! Jarvis would only respond to Stark I would have thought!! Coming to Mickey Rourke, well ,the guy kicks ass alright but then we miss Jeff Bridges' Obadiah Stane here! Being a Sam Rockwell fan i just explained his uninspiring act to myself by guessing he needed the money!! I read a review titled Clash-Bang-Boom! well that's all there is to this movie, which of course it does well..... but it's all style without substance!!I am being liberal in rating it 6 stars because i just adore the franchise...i was this close to giving it a 5/10.(well what do i know, i am just one of the audience!!)I pray they don't mess up the third one.",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010

I enjoyed the first movie so much that I was convinced that its sequel would be just as equally, if not more so, entertaining and action packed and complex as the first movie. With all that being said, Iron Man 2 was a tremendous letdown for me. The final action scene was a complete joke. The small details in the plot that were supposed to enhance and enrich the movie and make it more complex failed horribly. The whole ordeal with Samuel L Jackson was a good thought, but it would have served the movie better if it had spent more time with the smaller details of the plot. I found it extremely difficult to take ""Hammer"" seriously. I understand that he wasn't supposed to be the dark force that RDJ is up against, but he could have still been made to be a believable character. Mickey Rourke did a good job acting, and RDJ was okay at best, and in the end I find that I was severely disappointed with the finished product. The movie came across to me to be just another one of those ""America is bad ass and always wins no matter what"" movies that have served only to polarize my faith in the American Cinema.

Unfortunately, the sequel is beginning to show a few signs of what I like to call sci-fi syndrome. It has gotten a little bit too in love with itself, and as such is going too much in depth with side characters. In the first movie, Robert Downey Jr and Jeff Bridges dominated the screen time, showing off Gwyneth Paltrow on the side when it could, and this lead to a great feeling of the hero against the villain. In this sequel, Mickey Rourke did an amazing job in his character, was actually intimidating, and seemed completely cool, but he hardly had any screen time at all, so it was impossible to actually see him as a powerful villain to be feared.

The pace and action of the movie are terrific. Robert Downey Jr.'s acting and presence in the movie carries it with charm and charisma and you like the Tony Starke character who unlike other comic book hero alter egos actually is not nebbish. Gwyneth Paltrow is good in this movie though she is more wallpaper in many of the scenes and the Sam Rockwell character was just a joy to watch. Mickey Rourke rocks in his role as he eats scenery with panache and yet his acting is so natural. If I had any problem with this movie was the presence of Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johanssen they were just draining on the movie. Jackson again plays the same character he has been playing for it seems the last 15-20 years and basically puts me off any movie he appears in while Scarlett may be easy to look at but what is the big deal about her acting she is listless and incredibly charisma free. The director Jon Favreau is superb and his acting is fun and basically grab your popcorn and get ready for the ride and with AC/DC music what else can one ask for.

""Iron Man 2"" might will have been subtitled ""The Sins of the Fathers,"" with its A-story involving Mickey Rourke's bizarre performance as the son of a man who felt he was wronged by Howard Stark, who himself was no peach of a father to our hero Tony. But the movie is less interested in exploring this than in perfunctory world-building and in repeating beats from the first film, right down to a climactic battle that is a retread of ""Iron Man""'s climax. The one saving grace of this film is Sam Rockwell as Tony Stark wannabe Justin Hammer. Rockwell, who was a leading contender for Tony Stark before Marvel settled on Robert Downey, Jr., shows what he could have done with the role. It's not that Rockwell would have been better than Downey's by now iconic personification, but it's fun to see a variation on Stark's snarky, egocentric megalomania that can hold his own with the master. And fun is something this film could have used a lot more of.",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010

754,11 May 2010,Squave,5," More of the same in easy going sequel.
","We return again to John Favreau's take on comic book hero 'Iron Man'. This time man behind the mask, Tony Stark, is having a hard time of it as ""the suit that is keeping him alive is also killing him"". As well as that he has a Russian Mickey Rourke on his hand's financed by a very American Sam Rockwell. He should be having a hard time of it but the films chief flaw, surprisingly, is Downey Jr.'s inability to be anything other than charismatic, cool and in-control. Due to this we are never in any doubt that he will overcome these problems and thus suspense and dramatic thrust are almost null. Rourke is also a problem, his performance is fine, but in a film so big and silly introducing him as merely a physicist who has a reason for revenge somewhat belittles the audience's intelligence and his characters motivation. The film builds up ahead of steam and in doing so the inevitable battle at the end is easily one of the biggest anti - climaxes in modern action cinema. That being said, we do have a hell of a time getting there with Gwyneth Paltrow and Scarlett Johanson easily stealing the acting acclaim when Rockwell isn't on screen. The three of them together almost make you forget about the meek Don Cheadle and the kind-of-but-not-really pointless Samuel L. Jackson (cameo?). All that being said nobody will feel short-changed or un-entertained when they leave the cinema. Downey Jr. has enough quips and just enough fights to leave you smiling and the adrenaline pumping, and once again Favreau himself, makes the smartest decision of them all by having him out of the suit more times than not. He also deals very well in following up his bold decision to reveal who the man in the mask was in the first film. All in all 'Iron Man 2' lies just ahead of the Fantastic Four but well behind Spiderman and Batman on the league table of post-millennium superheros. A film this clumsy, repetitive, shallow and stupid has no right to be this entertaining.",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010

","Iron man when released in 2008 made fans of the character really excited for what was next in is story and while i like the character and the story's that are told i think that this one did not impress me like it should have and that really bums me out as marvel has some of the hottest movies that have been released in recent years so i am still unsure if this one impresses me at all.
obviously Robert Downey Jr is the star of the entire movie he has really brought to life Tony Stark as the very troubled man you do really feel he kills it as the role and another star who really makes me fanboy scream is Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff and my word does she kick so much ass that it further proves how awesome she is and the villains of this movie were Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke they were perfect villains in evilness in strategy not really but i have to say there acting is not bad in this one. Don Cheadle wasLt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes which was a change from the first movie which really bothers me because in this one war machine is given more to do so i was really happy to see him team up with tony in the finale. there was some outstanding supporting actors there was Gwyneth Paltrow,Paul Bettany, Samuel L. Jackson,Clark Gregg and Jon Favreau so not only do we have a solid cast of leads we have supporting actors who to me hold it all together.
i'm really on the fence with this movie i like some aspects of it and others i hate so it would seem fairly even if they hadn't make me engaged the entire movie and that's what Marvel and the Iron man series has done so that makes me happy obviously the part which upsets me is the change of actors from Rhodey is something that upset me and i like the new one it's just something that bugs me and probably the fans too but i obviously think its still solid and it holds up and its not the best but its not the worst so i don't mind.",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010

I also think that the villain is super boring, with no interesting character traits whatsoever. This problem is made even bigger by the pathetic side villain, by far the most annoying character in the movie. The action is still pretty well-filmed though, and the flying scene towards the end is pretty entertaining.

Can you see John Wayne, Clark Gable, Clint Eastwood saying, oh the Script calls for this tiny woman that weighs 80 pounds is going to beat my men up and then me, no, NOT HAPPENING. THE PROBLEM is these actors, the men, are willing to take a role like that and if they have juice allow themselves to be beat up by a woman that can't fight.

I think if you're not that familiar with the Marvel Universe you could find it confusing and maybe even boring. The thing I really enjoyed about this movie was that all the disparate events and characters go towards starting to define a cohesive movie version of the Marvel Universe. One of the things that has bugged me about superhero films in the past is that they try to occur in 'the real world'. The Hero is usually the only hero to exist, and only enough super-villains exist for the hero to vanquish in 2 hours. But these stories were never meant to work in the real world, they should be told within the context of a world of Marvels; a world of powers and magic, of super-spies and secret organisations, of advanced technology, miracle elements and mystical weapons. Iron Man 2 attempts this, but arguably at the expense of it's main character and a tight stand-alone script.

","Now I'm all for movies being loyal to their origins (in this case the original Marvel comics), but at some point, there has to be a little bit more of the ""human elements"" that create the fine line between the two in this film. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is the ego driven technology typhoon, whose cocky humor gets annoying at times, has a problem. His power supply is running low and he is slowly dying. This film takes a more serious look into what Iron Man is truly composed of, but unfortunately the characters don't seem to understand the situation as much as we do.

Jon Favreau is good director(not to mention a decent actor) and I wish he would direct more superhero movies. I enjoyed how it explored further into Tony Stark's alcohol addiction. Now what I love about Tony Stark is that he's not some brooding millionaire or whiny some teen who keeps trying to figure out if he should be a superhero or not. Can you guess who I'm talking about? Stark is the kind of guy who loves being a superhero and likes to have a good time. Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow are as amazing as they were in the first one.

","When all is said an done, Iron Man 2 delivers. The question now perhaps is, did we need it in the first place? First things first, Downey simply makes this entire franchise worth watching and waiting for. He's got the Midas touch here when he's the troubled and pseudo egotistical Tony Stark. I simply can't think of a more capable and gifted actor in the last several years who's been able to reposition himself as an elite actor after years of a spiralling demise. What Downey brings to this Marvel tin soldier is depth and heart (even if his seems to be failing). The sequel picks up where the last one left off and for the first hour really has me enjoying these faces again. And with the scope of real domestic issues here, I was captivated. But as the story continues and Marvel simply wants to force feed us the impending crisis (as Sam Jackson seems to keep popping up to remind us) in all various remote locations in the world, we have to start cataloguing what elements are important to the story today and what can be shelved for later. After all, Avengers is still years away. Sam Jackson pops up and then flares up more and more like a case of vaginal warts. He offers the parties involved nothing of substance, but the possibility of a relationship later. More and more characters are introduced, subplots and villains galore and an army of Iron men. All of this occurring at the pinnacle disintegration of Tony Stark. Here Favreau begins to touch on the real dangers that Tony has within him, but finds a quick fix amongst the film canisters of a drunken father. Before you know it, the two hours have whizzed by and you can't help but wonder if you simply watched a retread of of the first Iron Man plot line. The film still works because of the richness of all the characters and it showcases how much the best actors can take what would potentially be a subpar script and make it into a gem.",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010

I really love when beside picturing the today's world and the current life of the superhero, but also producers bring in some part of history about them, about their parents etc, which is key in what, why and who the main characters became.
Robert Downey Jr is one of my favorite actors and there is not anyone in the whole world who can fir on the role of Iron Men more perfectly than him. Overall, the play of the actors is on a very high level, which of course was expected considering who is starring in this movie.

853,19 April 2020,frostyfrog,4," Iron Man 2
","Iron Man 2 is a film directed by Jon Favreau that starts Robert Downey Jr, Mickey Rourke and Don Cheadle and tells the story of a man named Ivan Vanko trying to exact revenge on Tony Stark due to familial betrayal in the past, while Tony deals with poison in his body and alcoholism. Iron Man 2 as a film has had a mixed impact at best on myself as a film fan. There are a lot of things I liked in the film and many things annoy the absolute hell out of me and unfortunately a lot dip into spoiler territory. The things I liked in the film include as usual Robert Downey Jr's performance and honestly for the rest of my Marvel Series I'm going to stop pointing out how great it is because without him there is no MCU and he's fantastic in every film. I also enjoyed seeing the film take a stab at the heavy topic of alcoholism and watching Tony struggle with the poison in his body. It didn't delve nearly as deep into these topics as I would've liked but it was still nice to see I suppose. Don Cheadle also plays Rhodey A.K.A War Machine very well in the film and as I stated in my review of the first Iron Man film, much better than Terrence Howard. Often times Howard felt like he tried to take the shine away from his co-stars (which I've heard is true but I'll have to double-check that one) but Cheadle is much more calm and I really enjoy the dry humor he gives Rhodey as a character. Also now that I've mentioned Tony and Rhodey, the only standout action sequence of the film in my eyes was when Tony and Rhodey fought at his party but I enjoyed it more from a comedic aspect than any other reason. I enjoyed the special effects in the film as well and I've always loved the scene where Tony puts on the Mark V suit on the race track. That whole transformation sequence from Suitcase to suit was awesome and not to spoil future series but it was also a bright spot of Michael Bay's Transformers films. I also enjoyed AC/DC being utilized as well. It's about at this point that the notable positives end and everything else begins. Ivan Vanko and Justin Hammer are very flat as villains despite the efforts of Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell. Rourke's motivation to go after Stark is that Starks father took all the credit for the design of the Arc Reactor when in reality his father Anton Vanko was working on it with him as well. You never get a sense of the depth of this betrayal aside from the fact that Anton and Ivan live in a really crappy house in Russia and the Starks are... well... Billionaires. Ivan doesn't have a personality aside from wanting to bring Tony Stark down and an affection for his bird. The only notable line of dialogue I remember from his character in the movie is ""I want my bird."" His whole plan, by the way, of getting revenge on Tony was to go to a race track and attack him with whips? How the hell do whips stop multiple long range weapons? Without Hammer Tech being in this movie, Vanko would have gotten his ass kicked and that would've been the movie. Speaking of Justin Hammer, he has no memorable lines or development and is basically Tony Stark but without the charm or snarkiness. He does it all because he wants to beat Stark in the business world, isn't that entertaining? If done correctly, it could've been. Problem is, he was just a boring billionaire movie sterotype. He also made a few dumb decisions in the movie like partnering with Vanko, a man who is clearly unstable to stop Tony Stark. Vanko didn't just attack Tony on that track, he destroyed two other formula ones and it was in front of international news cameras. If your intention is to outdo Stark and promote your brand then why would you partner up with Vanko, that makes you look horrible. If you were going to hide it from the public and privately work with him, wouldn't you question his psyche? Iron Man 2 also introduced us to SHIELD, Nick Fury and Black Widow and while that part of the movie was interesting, it certainly wasn't a wow factor. The action sequences featuring Black Widow were decent although they were cut together choppily. Johanssen did play Widow well though thankfully and her interactions with Happy were pretty funny. Jon Favreau as Happy is one of the more underrated elements of Marvel films, the man is funny. Samuel L Jackson played Fury well for the brief time he was on screen, felt like I should mention that. While we're on the topic, SHIELD helped Tony deduce a message from his dad that allowed him to create a new element to stop the poison in his chest. My question is, why would Howard Stark hide something like that from his son at all to start, why would he hide it in the form of what is essentially an Easter egg to continue and why would he hide it at all? Is it to increase the value of the Arc Reactor technology? That Arc literally powered a building in the first Iron Man. This film really annoys me from a narrative perspective, I know it was released around the time of the writer's strike but good God. These are questions that I'm asking while reviewing this film purely from memory because these are the damn reasons I just don't want to rewatch it. All of the notable aspects were really small, it felt like Iron Man 2 was more focused on building a franchise of Marvel films than really standing as it's own film which was evident with the presence of SHIELD and a post credits sequence featuring Thor's hammer. It's a shame that that's the case because the ability to stand on it's own is why I loved the first Iron Man film.

","I remember when this film came out. I was still on an Iron Man high because of the movie released prior and because of the animated series that was on at the time. I didn't get to see the film until many months later and this was a major of a disappointment because of how much is unfolding on screen during the film's runtime. It leaves you at a loss for words and not in a good way.
POSITIVES!
Robert Downey Jr. is still great. No matter the issues I have with the character in the film, Downey is good at portraying the cynical hero. Downey still shares great chemistry with the rest of the cast. The chemistry between Downey and Paltrow is fantastic and is one of the draws of the franchise. Sam Rockwell portrays Justin Hammer and he is very entertaining in his antagonistic role. The action scenes are very well done. Some of the best action in this franchise and it is all edited together well without audiences getting nauseous. The visual effects are incredible. A great mix between practical and a computer image. There's also some awesome, weapon sounds that emanate from the suits and drones. Also got some great music to go along with the project.
MIXED!
Explaining the plot to someone is difficult. Since it crosses many different stories, which I'll touch on soon. Don Cheadle takes over the role of James Rhodes after Terence Howard didn't reprise the role. Cheadle is okay, we've seen that he gets better, but he didn't bring the same energy to the character that Howard brought. Jon Favreau has said that he wanted more time on this project, but Marvel had a deadline so Favreau had to rush this project and it shows. But he did the best job capable. Now although we get new Iron Man armour and the War Machine armour, but there are a lot of those types weaponized suits/drones that it can be difficult to tell apart the ""characters"".
NEGATIVES!
A big issue this film has is it's writing. It doesn't know what story it wants to tell. It covers Tony's adventures as Iron Man, Tony and the supporting characters at Stark industries, two separate villain story arcs, and the setup of The Avengers taking a bigger role than it should've. There is too much to focus on and not all of it is interesting. Mickey Rourke is the real antagonist of the film and the film has no clue who the character is. I don't know if he is Whiplash or the character from the comics, Crimson Dynamo. And his performance feels very dull and at times he is impossible to understand. One thing about Iron Man in his franchise is that he doesn't have a score. It's a small complaint, but a superhero must have an awesome score. The film just isn't fun either. Tony Stark is fun in every other film the character utilized in except this one. Stark is unlikeable for a good deal of the film. Stark is meant to be the attraction, but the character is odious.
CONCLUSION!
So, Iron Man 2 should've been in development for a longer period. It's more of an Avengers prequel than an Iron Man continuation. Luckily the character grows after this, but this is a big dip in the Iron Man's career and the MCU. It's a film that makes you struggle with your opinion. It has its entertaining action and visual quality. But it suffers in delivering a powerful sequel.",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010

It began with quite a flat storyline being drawn, the storyline itself wasn't all that flat, but the bad acting of the Russian characters really made the storyline seem very flat in the beginning. And more could have been done to improve the beginning of the storyline. Actually the first scenes sucked all together. Then somewhere in the movie it feels like the government has stepped in and ordered it to be more boring so that no one would consider to build these suits themselves. Well guess what.. Japan's already there.. well.. anyway. Another thing that really disturbs me is that the agents in the first movie at least seemed cool. The only agent that seems like a bad-ass here is that girl agent.

This included entering a race, which leads to his greatest suit up scene. Another great scene that isn't fighting is his press conference one that has pay off in the end with the pinning. He is the man that has a clever remark to everything people throw at him and is shows here. And I love how they constantly interrupt each other like the real world. Downey gives his all in his role and this alone can carry a movie not having a complex plot. Scarlett Johansson enter the MCU in this movie and does an excellent job.

","I personally loved the original Iron Man. It was the best summer movie of the year when it came out. When i heard they would make a sequel, i was both thrilled but thinking, how are they going to top the first one. Honestly, my worst fears came true. Iron Man 2 takes place alittle bit after the first one, with Iron man enjoying his fame and attention he is receiving for revealing the truth of his identity at the end of the first film. Robert Downey Jr as always is fantastic as Tony Stark. In my opinion, he was not only born to play the super hero, but he IS tony stark in real life. Thats what makes the chemistry so amazing and real. Don Cheadle takes over the role of Iron Mans best friend, War Machine, after Terrance Howard was fired from the movie. He does a good job, hes a great actor, but i felt like he was alittle out of place, seeing as how this is his first official super hero movie. He also lacked chemistry in the friendship between Robert that Terrance had. The villain in this movie, Whiplash, is played by the fantastic and amazing Mickey Rourke. I gotta say, he went all out in this movie. He did not hold back, although i did feel like his character started faltering when Sam Rockwells character came in. This is where it all ended for me. Sam is a great actor, i have enjoyed many of his movies, and i respect him as an actor, but in this movie, i thought he really sucked. His character is so pathetic in some of the scenes he comes out in, i feel like if they had removed him and only kept Mickey, i might have awarded the movie a 9 instead of an 8. Some of his scenes are just plain stupid or pathetic to me, and i really felt bad that Mickey had to go through with doing these scenes with such bad scenes. Also, the actual fighting does not happen till the last 10 minutes of the film, and by then, you don't really care much for it anymore. Overall, i really wanted to fall in love with this movie, but i found myself thinking that it was okay at best. Sam is the only actor i will complain about in this movie, since his character sucked, but overall, i will award this movie an 8 out of 10, if you loved the original, definitely check out this one, just don't expect it to be as good or better.",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010

People who watched and like the first film will get entertained by this sequel like the first. Additional humors, extended actions, sufficient war machine scene time, usual Robert Downey Jr. charisma running wild, sexy but deadly black widow kicking butts and outstanding Mickey Rourke performance as whiplash tearing up iron man apart added into iron man 2 are fun enough to keep u watching without yawning!!!It has a good story regarding the character development of Tony Stark that also contributes to the main plot of the movie and also equal character build-up of other characters as well. I love whiplash in the movie for his armor,pretty cool deadly plasma whips and his recklessness and obsession in defeating Tony Stark but this is also a problem in the movie. What I'm trying to say is that being reckless doesn't mean he can ignore the explosive car collision occurred just right behind him or walking to the race track without 'safety' consideration. He's not putting on any armor that time and if isn't for his whip he's dead already. The exploded cars flew behind him and bursting to the ground coincidencely apart from whiplash position was ridiculous as if he thought that he's invincible with his exposed armor. Please, that isn't logic; that scene was made just to make him look bad ass!!!!Furthermore, the armored Whiplash screen time was little too short and unsatisfied as i felt that it could be prolonged like making iron man, war machine and whiplash continue fighting in the air until whiplash fall to the ground and knock out or sort. In addition, happy horgan driving into the race track was ridiculous as well for the same reason being on whiplash mentality. All i can say is that this movie lack logic like the first movie, will you stand still when u look at something that beeps like a time bomb in front of you, run dude!!

","Iron Man 2 is straight out entertainment. From the special effects to the fast paced way that the story is told, there is always something to keep the audience glued to the screen. Robert Downey Jr. is well suited in his role as Tony Stark. He portrays brashness with a bit of satire and the result is a performance that is captivating and at times, funny. Mickey Rourke also does well as physicist, Ivan Vanko. Rourke is a natural at playing sinister characters and in Iron Man 2, he comes off as someone capable of going to unknown lengths to get what he wants. Though this film appeals first to eyes, there are serious themes that underpin the story; themes like greed for power and money, the overpowering urge for vengeance and even the importance of parental love. In general, I liked how the film makers mixed in doses of action, humor and intrigue which together made for an interesting movie.

","Iron Man 2 is essentially the story of Iron Man 1 all over again. Tony Stark is a selfish irresponsible man who must correct his ways. The villains consist of an American businessman teaming up with a terrorist from a far away country. Tony Starks life is in danger and he must use his intelligence to invent something that will help him survive. Of all these huge retreads of the first movie, Tony being a reckless and selfish hotshot all over again is the worst. Whereas the first Iron Man movie did a good job of showing Tony Stark trying to better himself as a person, Iron Man 2 sends his character all the way back to square one. By making Tony Stark once again this irresponsible hotshot the movie essentially negates all of his character development from the first movie. This movies intention wasn't to tell a compelling story. Instead it is basically one big trailer for ""The Avengers"" trying to satisfy comic book fanboys. ""Look there's Iron Man!"", "" Hey there's War Machine"", ""Wow Black Widow's here too!"", ""And there's Nick Fury"", ""Cool there's Captain Americas Shield"". Instead of making a good sequel they basically just told the same story as the first movie except with a bunch of Avengers related stuff. However with all this said, I don't think Iron Man 2 is a bad movie. Robert Downey Jr. is still great in the leading role. The soundtrack is great with classic songs from AC/DC and Queen. The action is much more entertaining than in the first one. And also the special effects are pretty good. Unlike the first movie Iron Man 2 doesn't take itself too seriously and thus makes sitting through the movie pretty easy.

","This is another film which as you can see I've given a pretty good score for, and yet I remain frustrated because it so easily could have been great where it was merely quite good. In the first film about forty minutes was dedicated to stark figuring out how to use that suit. But Don chucks the suit on and he's good to go. Even the flying which was demonstrated as a very difficult procedure in the first film, was suddenly child's play. Many would say at this point that features can't go on for 4 hours just to make everything realistic but this film didn't need to. There was enough pointless clutter for it to do everything right and bypass all the films major flaws. Long sequences of scarlet auditioning for the new karate kid movie wasted everyones time and whilst being very entertaining to watch didn't need to be in this particular film. I can assume that her presence as a hard-core beating up men was to give the girls a thrill. That said if Robert downy doesn't thrill you nothing will. Sam jacks'n, and his team of hard-cores could have been wiped out of this movie along with the corny way stark came about the new power source. That would have opened up enough time to develop dons character as another iron man properly, and stark could have upgraded the power source in a way that was not clichéd, far fetched and made us want to skip ahead to the next amazing fight sequence. First film had a poor bad guy and the fighting was mediocre.

If they continue that way, I'm really looking forward to part 5 or 6. Apart from the soundtrack, the dialogues are funny most of the time, and really well done in one scene or the other. Especially when Mickey Rourke lurks around. On the other hand, you may start wondering, why he is lurking around at all... But let's not start counting the plot-holes or wondering about the motives of the villains, or why the 'Hammer' doesn't lose his lollipop to the next best gangster-wannabe from his own outfit. If you watch this movie and wait a year, you'll probably remember some not-so-special good old Hollywood-action-flick-handiwork, a rocking soundtrack and one or two pointed quotes. And, maybe, you remember the few scenes that were not so standard-action-flick-like at all and more like those boring, slow moving things where they actually take the time to paint a character from different angles and try to take a closer look at his thoughts or motives.

","I've always had and in fact always will have a sense of awe on the level of technology Hollywood manages to apply in creating motion pictures. The sequences, sets, artwork etc. look extremely genuine on screen that gives us a real time experience. Now, there is a popular sect of movies in Hollywood that boasts extravaganza in everything except a logical storyline and among them as one of the front runners is Iron Man 2. Directed by Jon Favreau, the director for the first venture of Iron Man series casts all the same actors in the previous roles and the new ones being Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle and Mickey Rourke in this sequel which boasts almost twice the quality of the visual effects produced by the first film. Tony Stark is back, this time as the most popular figure in the world because he is the IRON MAN. After the dramatic revealing of his secret identity, Tony Stark pledges to achieve universal peace. But all superheroes cannot carry out their 'good job' so easily; there are always obstacles in the form of villains. So does iron man, who faces hostility in every clichéd way possible. Very much like Spiderman 3 , Iron man 2 fails to impress due to two reasons. Robert Downey Jr plays very redundantly throughout without experimenting and Gwyneth Paltrow plays her role like a zombie. I doubt whether Don Cheadle actually had any idea about his role in the movie because he moves back and forth with the nature of his character. Scarlett Johansson looks stunning but again lacks a well defined role. The only relief in terms of acting was Mickey Rourke who did justice to his role though not given much screen space. So in first case the lack of character definition provided the major flaw to the movie. If the actors had done a good job, I wouldn't have cared much about the complex storyline. For one thing, the sequences are so startling that one thing struck me immediately; the filmmakers have lost all respect for the world. So here, the second factor too comes to effect where the director has complicated the theme with less of logic and more of mindless destruction and in a way terrorism too. So if you are ready for a thrilling and chilling ride with lot of explosions, firing and iron man vs. iron man and if you think the story accounts to nothing, then iron man 2 is the one for you.",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010

He could have undergone a character transformation in this movie, to stop being so prideful, while simultaneously finding his cure.

","Iron Man 2 was good. The beginning with Tony at the convention in the suit was a good part and when Whiplash was developing his weapons were both great scenes. When Tony was driving the race car and then had the battle with Whiplash I thought was good, and when Hammer took him in to help take down Tony was also interesting. When Hammer and Whiplash were having the side plot with the bird, though, I thought was stupid and unnessisary. What I did find interesting was when Rhoads took the other Iron Man suit and became War Machine and then fought Iron Man, I genuinely thought that was a great scene. But then the fight when Iron Man and War Machine we're back to back fighting of the bad guys was a good scene, but it seemed to be almost the exact same as Iron Man 1.

The action sequences in Iron Man 2 just did'nt have the ""wohoo"" factor. When comes to performances there is no need to say anything about the cast they are just so apt and perfect for their roles . But sadly an actor with talent like Mickey Rourke is left out as he has very less screen time but he surely does make his presence felt.

Given that there are a few exceptional and even better sequels to superhero movies e.g. Spider-man 2, X-Men 2, The Dark Knight etc. So I started to become skeptical. as the date drew closer and i saw trailers being released, I became even more afraid. The idea of multiple superheroes was shown in the trailers and immediately my thoughts strayed to the utter disappointment of *swallow* Spider-man 3. So naturally i became even more afraid. opening night I went to go see it, nail biting the whole way in and secretly thumbing a rosary in my pocket... OK not really...

","A man made of Iron!? Are they MAD!? Frankly, I would have just used a giant magnet to beat him in the first instalment. But alas! They didn't listen, now Downey is suited up in CGI again to return in this sequel. At first look at the opening of the film, seeing Ivan Vanko, aka Whiplash (Rourke), give an unconvincing, whimpering shout as his dad peacefully dies; immediately, 'don't laugh, it's supposed to be serious' is the first thought that crosses the mind. But then away from that hideous piece of acting, and after the long, long, ever so long title sequence, the film really starts to begin. The plot isn't a surprising one, as Vanko coincidentally is a super villain physicist (that old chestnut) who knows how to create the palladium energy source and tries to sell it to Hammer (Rockwell). Meanwhile, Stark has some trouble's of his own, and has to find a new element to stop the palladium's toxicity from killing him. Besides the fact he has an army of droids coming to kick his metal American ass. The narrative is relatively easy to follow and most people will understand it, except the one person with the east London accent who always says, ""I don't get it"" to any film that wasn't created by Disney. Downey does give another sublime, cheeky performance, saying his cute one liners and woman-wooing ways that makes you giggle. Apart from his comedy; everything else is pretty much dark and serious which isn't always the best road to go down when making a film about a super hero, for example, Spider Man 3. Oh dear. But Favreau does manage to dodge the bullet with putting Downey and his light hearted ways on camera nearly all of the time. No pressure Robert! As for the rest of the cast, pretty average and almost shadowed behind the lead. The action sequences are much more complex in this film, which is more eye pornography than meaningful. As there is more talking and witty banter between characters in this film, the fighting scenes are neglected and only a few are shown, which makes you savour them, like it's the last Fruit Pastel in a tube. The special effects are typical of a tent pole movie; well constructed with a perfect shine to make you believe they're real which overall adds to quite an intense effect. If you really want the full experience of this film's fighting sequences, you have to see it at an IMAX. Overall, Iron Man 2 is a watchable sequel with a few moments that have to be seriously tweaked, but definitely worth the price of an admission ticket with the friends. Plus the soundtrack is awesome, AC/DC and SugarHill Gang in the same movie!? Count me in!",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010

","OK, I will keep this review short and sweet. The movie was good. It wasn't a mediocre movie, and it wasn't amazing, but it was a fun movie. Iron Man 2 feels like a sequel should, an extension of the first. There were dull parts, and exiting parts, and the villain is very interesting, but somewhat unbelievable. The fact that he is a poor Russian living on the street, but somehow a scientist, I still have problems with. There are still lots of funny, Playboy-oriented parts, and lots of butt-kicking action scenes. One of the two problems that I have with this movie is that problem is that, without spoiling the movie, it got somewhat unreal near the end, specifically on how a certain-other someone can fly the suit without experience. The other reason is that, there really isn't anything new, it is very much like the first movie, and if you didn't like the first, it won't do anything to draw newcomers in, but fans of Iron Man and the comics will be pleased. Although I prefer the first, it is hard to make a sequel that is better than the original, and this is almost as good as the first. I payed $11.00 to see this movie, and I don't regret it.

I enjoyed Iron Man 2 for three reasons: the strong cast, the special effects, and Robert Downey Jr. Reprising his role as Tony Stark, Downey uses his natural wittiness to maximum effect. At times though, he just comes across as a pompous asshole. His nonchalant approach to acting is entertaining to watch and makes me think he's just being himself in the roles he chooses. That being said, there's a lot of flaws and clichés in this film. Unfortunately, with these big budget blockbusters, the studio puts too many constraints on the director. Too much time is allocated to action scenes and there's way too many characters for the audience to have to care about. As with the latest Batman movies, an important supporting character had to be replaced by a similar and more talented actor than the first installment. I really hate when that happens!

","Instead of being called ""Iron Man 2,"" the title of this film should read, ""Iron Man's Day Off"" because we spend so little time with Iron Man and more time with endless scenes of boring conversation and arguing. When you actually find yourself genuinely annoyed at fictional characters for, frankly, just talking too much, it's a clear sign of a film with flaws. Remember that feeling when you've just begun your 40 minute commute to work, and the radio-show you're listening to is about to do an interesting bit? Instead, 40 minutes later, the over-talkative DJ is still stuck on the same silly rant from the beginning of your commute and because of a 9 o'clock meeting you never get to hear the bit. This is Iron Man 2 the longer it played out. Example - Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Warhammer (Don Cheadle) are planning for the final showdown we've been waiting for at the film's climax. In my head, this scene still has not ended: ""You stand there, because if I stand there I (insert sarcastic comment). Okay, deal!"" Great, now we're finally getting down to business, as both characters then go off for battle. But one of them stops. ""Wait, I don't like this, what if you..."" as they suddenly walk back to argue some more. Well by this point in the film, only a lobotomy-patient would not want to yell ""Just go fight the bleeding robots!

","The movie is average, i didn´t hate it but also didn´t liked it, it has many fun moments, really good scenes with great acting like when Tony sees his dad message in film, but also it has cringey moments like Tony´s birthday party for example. my major problem is the tone of the movie is inconsistent, the transition from fun moments to more mature moments doesn´t feel like a natural transition like they did in the first one",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010
1011,1 July 2021,rabbyf-99328,8," Definitely more scientific than other superhero movies
","While this is not my favorite movie or in my top 5 for best MCU movies, I really do appreciate how realistic the scientific process is kept. Obviously, Tony Stark made some interesting choices by trying to go out in his showy attitude and dying from high palladium levels in his bloodstream and announcing to the world that he is THE nuclear deterrent. It invited challenges like Ivan, who believed that the throne was rightfully his and that his father suffered and died because of Tony and his father. Not only that, it raised havoc for the public who just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. Overall, the movie provided great insight onto how particle colliders worked and the creation of a new element however, it is a superhero movie at the end of the day so there is more room to play with what is scientifically accurate.",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010

1013,19 January 2022,germankamalov-72461,8," So so
","The film is worse than the first-two new characters Ivan Vanko (where did the Americans take such a name and why did they add Russians?) performed by Mickey Rourke, who looks more like a tattooed criminal than a talented nuclear physicist who created some kind of energy super whip in artisanal conditions-it looks like nonsense. Sam Rockwell playing the role of gun magnate Justin Hammer looks more like a buffoon or a clown than a businessman. The performance of the Whip (Mickey Rourke) at the rally in Monaco is just idiocy, not action. These two characters spoil the whole movie. The impression is saved by Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), who fights superbly and looks great in a skirt and tight leather pants. Tony Stark himself is not behaving in the best way-foolishly and if Nick Fury had not come to him, a Trindets would have come. But the guy got out and defeated the robots created by the bad guy Whip. At the end of the film There is a cool, but annoying and monotonous slaughter. The movie is not super, so four.",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010

","I personally really enjoyed this movie, because as usual the character iron man, is not your average cliche hero. He has flaws like everyone else, and his witty remarks are hilarious. This movie never fails to make me laugh, and the plot is intense and exciting. The enemy brings out information of Tony Stark's past, and brings excitement to the plot. The tension that is built from Tony trying to out smart and cheat his death makes the movie even more interesting to watch. The only part I did not enjoy was the scene after Tony's birthday party where he is in a fighting scene with his friend, and it seems the scene goes on forever. This scene and the events of his birthday party give me second hand embarrassment. Other than that, this movie is a very good watch.",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010

1018,20 May 2010,Corpsdawg,7," Not quite Spider-Man 2, but worth the wait.
","An awaited sequel with high expectations, Iron Man 2 will definitely satisfy the summer movie goer's need for a action packed film. My original expectations for the film were that it would be as good, if not better than the original Iron Man. Although the film didn't live up to my expectations, it did everything, but disappoint. Although campy in some parts, the film succeeds in building on Tony Stark's character crisis, provides humor in unexpected places, and drops many clues for the future Avengers film. I would have loved to give this film a 7.5, but couldn't score it as high as an 8, so a 7 will have to suffice. If you enjoyed the original film you will more than likely love this one as well.",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010

1020,23 May 2012,vipershardware,7," Not bad for a second film, lets hope the 3rd is as good as the 1st
","This would have been great had Terrence Howard not asked for so much money and just done the part, Don C. is a good actor but if you want to maintain continuity than for the love of film making use the same actors, because the combo of Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow and the rest of the crew made a very strong foundation and that foundation got some holes shot in it when they brought back ""Roddy"" (Terrence Howard's original character) and replace him with a completely different actor!!! What the heck guys, you could have given him a different name/title/rank something, but making the same character and having him played by two different actors is just wrong. Also the part of ""Justin Hammer"" was a bit much, but I think that was the whole point so we can let that one slide. Mickey Rourke made a great addition and the special effects were top shelf, definitely a good movie, but what keeps it from being a great movie and out-doing the first is the continuity which was ruined by one simple actor not willing to play ball. Who knows maybe there were other factors in the mix, but I stand by the point that you shouldn't have two difference actor's play the same character. Nuff said.",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010
1021,7 May 2010,JoeyBags89,7," Pretty good for a setup movie
","Just got out of the theater. Not a bad flick. Not much action, most comes at the end. To me, this felt like a setup movie for the upcoming film The Avengers. (If you stay past the end credits, there's even more). Overall, I'm going to give this a 7 out of 10, a solid movie, in no way perfect. I wish Favreau (sp?) utilized Mickey Rourke a bit more. The final fight was kind of depressing. However, walking out of the movie, I was telling my friend ""I like what there doing, incorporating all the individual Avengers and then tying them up in a single movie"" which is what Iron man 2 does.

","I noticed something that perhaps would amuse some people who like small details, and perhaps disappoint the editors of the movie Iron Man 2. *Minor Spoiler Alert* During that scene where Starks was directing the laser to the element-synthesizer, the laser shredded the walls and shelves, but failed to damage the wiring, which was obviously in the laser's path, that was powering the synthesizer.",/review/rw2246433/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_2_(2010
