1,22 October 2015,ivo-cobra8,9," A Big improvement over Iron Man 2 : Defending an Underrated Marvel third entry!
","Iron Man 3 (2013) is A Marvel pure, fun, popcorn, Action Film and the third entry of the Iron Man trilogy. It is an awesome superhero Action flick a huge improvement over Iron Man 2 (2010) and million ways better than the new Marvel comic book film Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)!!!!!!!! This film is very criticized and bashed from it is fans. I admit it the first time I watched this film, I hated it, with the Mandarian joke the twist and Guy Pearce been the bad guy and so on. But now after I watch it I was highly impressed and Entertained, this film wasn't boring it had less humor in it and was the most serious with action scenes. Shure there is less Iron Man and more Tony in it, but doesn't ruined my loving for Iron man trilogy! The most what I love of this film is. There wasn't any Avengers in it trough the whole film. Only Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk made a cameo scene on the end of the credits but that was it and it did not bother me or annoyed. The story centers around Tony Stark not Avengers, that is why I just love this movie! Thank god Jon Favreau step down as the Director and Shane Black replaced him! I was surprised by the fact that Disney allowed Shane Black making an Action film flick in Lethal Weapon and Die Hard With a Vengeance style! Yes Action style!",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013
2,9 November 2013,shangsta,8," Hated it at first, I like it more each time I re-watch
","The first time I saw this movie I really didn't like it, I had just come off the high of ""The Avengers"" and let me make it clear, this one isn't as good. That said it is significantly better than Iron Man 2 and that's because the story is deeper and direct. There's a lot less focus on explosions and fancy effects (although there is plenty of that) and more on dialogue and character development.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013
3,9 August 2014,jfgibson73,8," I hope this series never ends
","I thought this movie was a lot of fun, and I may have enjoyed it even more than the first two. The two big criticisms I see people making about it are that the Mandarin wasn't the same as in the comics, and that Tony didn't use the armor much. I consider the Mandarin to be a boring villain in the first place. The comedy was worth not having an iconic super villain. As far as not using the armor enough, I did want to see more of Iron Man tearing stuff apart. But again, I liked what we got in place of it so much, it was an agreeable trade off. Seeing how resourceful Tony can be with none of his technology was just as fun, and the stuff with the kid was full of great humor. Guy Pearce's sleazy bad guy in a suit wasn't nearly as much fun as Justin Hammer from #2--I would have rather had him back. The after-credits scene legitimately had me worried--I want to imagine Tony and Banner are hanging out. I don't like the idea that they might not be getting along! Even all the other problems people point out about plot holes and character inconsistencies don't really diminish how much I enjoyed IM3. I thought the script was incredible and I was constantly surprised at how inventive it was. RD jr. created a character for the ages with his take on Tony, but with this installment, I now feel this character and this movie series may be among my personal favorites. This movie is just too smart to be a big summer action kids movie, but it had its cake and ate it too: well made and impossibly successful. Good for them. I want more.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

","How will Marvel's universe ever be the same after ""The Avengers""? There's bound to be a vocal percentage of viewers who walk out of ""Iron Man 3"" thinking, ""why didn't he just call his superfriends in the end?"" It's a good question, one that Drew Pearce and Shane Black's script doesn't ignore, but never satisfyingly answers. Yet that doesn't seem to matter. The bigger question that Marvel has addressed is whether it could effectively narrow the scope of its universe again after ""The Avengers"" blew it open—and the answer is yes.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

'Iron Man 3' is a perfect demonstration of that – for the first 40 mins, Stark is the same arrogant, cocksure person he was in the self-important 'Iron Man 2'; and then after crashing and burning in his damaged suit in the middle of a wintry expanse, Stark is forced to start over, and that rebirth brings back what made the first 'Iron Man' so infectiously entertaining in the first place.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

","Iron Man 'Three'. I want to write about this before the general thoughts: by now you may know the ""twist"", but why even say that? The entertainment comes from going in cold, after all, and it's the kind of thing that has drawn audiences down in a polar sort of way. You find out what is really going on with a character, and it... is hilarious. For me. It does something different, it alters the expectations that come with such a blockbuster that delivers the same-old same-old, and most of all, the filmmakers understand that they can make a point here too, as Iron Man did in 2008: a little statement about the world we're living in, in that case it was the militarization of the third world, and here it's media manipulation. It doesn't over-do it; and the actor's revelation is just splendid.

","The director of this film called: "" Iron Man 3 "" is Shane Black. Together with screen writer and Marvel comic Creator Stan Lee they surpass themselves. The movie proves to be an exciting, sky jaunting, world traveling explosion for the mind. The story continues the saga of handsome Tony Stark (Robert Downy Jr.), who is a Billionaire and inventive genius. From the creative mind of Marvel comics, writer Stan Lee, comes this third segment of the Iron Man. In this chapter, we find Stark in a fitful state while his active mind is unable to allow his body to rest or sleep. As such he is ripe for an attack from his newest enemy called Mandarin ( Ben Kingsley) who promises to destroy Iron Man. The first attack is to Starks' Malibu home which Mandarin destroys with three guided missiles. Among all the things which Tony loses is his beautiful beach-side home, his girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and his wealth which leaves him destitute and homeless. Crashing on the ground in the state of Tennesse, Stark realizes he must start again. He does this with the help of Jarvis, (Paul Bettany) his Robotic aid, Harley Kenner (Ty Simpkins) an orphan boy who inspires Tony to rebuild himself and James Rhodes (Dom Cheadle) who reprises his role as his Military friend. Together they take on the International criminal called Manderin (Ben Kingsley) and his major henchman called Aldrich Killian. (Guy Pearce). The movie is filled with high drama, Damsel rescues, Presidential protection, high flying chills and thrills and explosive combat displays. The reckless pursuit of action scenes is what drives this movie. The cast which included Miguel Ferrer as Vice President Rodriguez is exceptional and lends itself to the complete foundation for a real exciting Classic. I fully recommend this movie to all movie fans and friends of Stan Lee. ****",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

","There is a difference between Jon Favreau's Iron Man films and Shane Black's Iron Man 3. The last two Iron Man mostly studies the human complexity of Tony Stark which already makes a pretty compelling film even if it leaves the action as its extra pleasure. In this Iron Man, it is more into the large explosions which is totally right for its source material. In this film, you will find one of the best action sequences of the superhero movie milieu. The plot gets a little messy at times and the morality beneath it is quite obvious, but without a doubt, the film is excessively fun.

","With comic book movies, there is a repeating cycle. The first one has our attention. The sequel, most of the time (in the case of Spider-man 2, The Dark Knight, X2, etc.), outdoes the original. But then we are eventually faced with the third part. In some cases (The Dark Knight Rises), the third part kicks ass. In most cases (Spider-man 3, X-Men: The Last Stand), they are the weakest.

","This movie has lots of special effects and lots of noise and lots of excellent actors, but it forgot to include one thing: a story. Well, actually, there is a story, of sorts, but it is so superficial as to render it moot. This movie is proof that special effects alone do not make for a good movie, or for even a fair movie. When Miss Penny has to bail out Iron Man, that's a sure sign that the script department is desperate. But that aside, the story is so shallow and the bad guys so predictable that the movie loses dramatic power, rendering it stale. Of course, this can happen when a comic book story is transposed onto the screen. If not portrayed correctly, the story will not be taken seriously, and the movie tanks. Iron Man 1 and 2 managed to avoid that problem; this movie does not. As a result, we have an Iron Man who offers nothing new and is dealing with bad guys who are laughable. Ben Kingsley's performance is a joke. Robert Downey Jr. is, as usual, excellent as Iron Man, but without a viable script, his presence cannot save this movie from its mediocrity, and who wants to watch mediocrity?",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

","""Tony Stark"" (Robert Downey Jr.) is having some severe traumatic difficulties stemming from his recent combat experience depicted in ""The Avengers"". Unfortunately, he doesn't have time to resolve these issues because a terrorist by the name of ""the Mandarin"" (Ben Kingsley) is targeting him, his wife ""Pepper Potts"" (Gwyneth Paltrow) and ""President Ellis"" (William Sadler). Not only that but he has also earned the enmity of a mad scientist by the name of ""Aldrich Killian"" (Guy Pearce). Now, not wanting to spoil the film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that there are some twists involved which deviate from the original plot and serve this movie quite well. Having said that let me also state that I am not a big fan of action movies that consist of simply action and CGI. And while this film has plenty of both there is also some good acting on the part of Robert Downey Jr. and Guy Pearce. Additionally, there is a good story to be had here too. Be that as it may, I would like to advise those who haven't seen this movie to see ""The Avengers"" or possibly one of the other two ""Iron Man"" films before watching this one if for no other reason than to have a little bit of continuity. That's not to say that this movie can't be enjoyed on its own because it certainly can.

21,11 September 2013,aesgaard41,9," Iron Man Soars And Fails On Different Levels -
","I think it was in ""Last Action Hero"" that the kid sidekick told Arnold Schwarzeneggar's movie character that by the third movie, everything is supposed to get harder, and that's very much obvious in ""Iron Man 3"" because Robert Downey Jr.'s character of Tony Stark spends more time out of his suit than he did in it in both the first two movies. Once more dipping into the franchise of Marvel Comics, a terrorist named the Mandarin played by Ben Kingsley is threatening the world, and it is again up to Tony to stand up to defending the planet, only he is not going to be helped by his teammates from ""The Avengers."" Tony is assisted by Don Cheadle as War Machine aka Iron Patriot and the rest of his iron brigade that by this movie he has developed to operate by voice control. Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts actually gets more to do than just scream and be a victim; she actually gets to wear the suit and become the Iron Princess. The movie and plot are rungs above the first two films with a lot more going on. Experiencing a bit of post-traumatic stress after the aliens in ""Avengers,"" Tony proves he doesn't need the suit as he deals with a number of genetically enhanced assassins led by Guy Pearce who can actually burn through the suit via a genetic quirk that amped his healing factor. (Does Wolverine know this chowder-head stole his gimmick?) Watching the movie, I can't help but wonder if Tony has ever seen a zombie flick; why doesn't he just shoot these people in the head? There is no way they can regenerate brain cells. Once those things are lost, there is no coming back. Beyond that, ""Iron Man 3"" is beyond exemplary, setting new standards for all superhero flicks coming up or in production and establishing that it really doesn't matter who's in the suit, just what you do with it. There are a few more deaths than usual, and several jaw-dropping moments, and Downey's quips and the fact the movie itself doesn't take itself serious make it more than appealing. My only fault with it is that Tony was going to come to Tennessee, he could have stopped by and said hello. My advice: leave the genetically enhanced assassins in California.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

26,30 May 2014,khanbaliq2,8," An electrifying but provocative comic-book film.
","Iron Man 3 is another solid entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's somewhat different from the two Iron Man films before because Shane Black replaced Jon Favreau as director. Favreau's influence on the film is evident, and he appears in his role as Happy Hogan, now Stark Industries head of security. Iron Man 3 offers just as much popcorn entertainment as Favreau's efforts. It's a more interesting film than Iron Man 2 (2010) because Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) has to rely on his smarts and innovation instead of his firepower as he faces forces beyond his control. Iron Man 2 is a solid, enjoyable sequel but it was a bit of a letdown after Iron Man (2008). In Iron Man 3 the screenplay by Shane Black and Drew Pearce takes unexpected turns for a superhero movie. Purists may be upset by the changes from the comic books, but the surprises are actually neat. The big reason why this works is because the new actors, Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce, James Badge Dale, Ty Simpkins and Stephanie Szostak, deliver memorable performances. Downey, Jr. is as good as ever, and he handles the humor just as well as in the terrific crime-comedy Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005). But Shane Black didn't bring only his clever comedy to Iron Man 3. He maintained the series' playful tone without neglecting Stark's struggle. He also delivered spectacular action set pieces in which Iron Man gets to put his abilities to good use, like in the dizzying action sequence involving Air Force One. Iron Man 3 is definitely the funniest Marvel film yet, but the drama involving Extremis is no less effective. The visual effects for the film were handled by 17 companies, including Scanline VFX, Digital Domain, and Weta Digital. Thanks to the excellent CGI we get to see the good-looking suits that Tony Stark has been working on. After the events of The Avengers (2012) he didn't spend all his time brooding because of his posttraumatic stress disorder. Brian Tyler contributed a good, bombastic music score for Iron Man 3. It features a memorable theme, and works well with the drama of the film too. I've seen all the Marvel films in a theater and, just like all of them, Iron Man 3 wasn't a letdown. The action, the comedy, the drama, the acting, and simply the intelligence of these films always make them enjoyable. Producer Kevin Feige was influenced by RoboCop (1987), something that makes it clear what his formula is. I definitely recommend Iron Man 3.

33,13 May 2013,Ziya90,1," The inappropriate tone and motivation for a comic book movie make it the worst
","Unfortunately, Iron Man is the worst installment of the trilogy by far because it works more like a parody of Iron Man. I had expected something different, brilliant, genius etc. from Shane Black, ""a breath of fresh air"" but instead the movie was like an unlikeable parody as said with lots of further disappointing material! Despite I didn't find the first Iron Man film perfect, masterpiece etc. at least it was cool and solid. Yes, if I have to define the first Iron Man film with two words, that would be cool and solid! The second film was found mostly disappointing including me, because the main problem of the second movie was there was no ""spark"" in the movie (no pun indeed), it was lack of spark, suspense and excitement and it was more like a comedy drama than an action packed film. However, this is much worse. Most of the film consists of comedy, a little drama and Tony Stark without his Iron Man suit! In the first half, there is almost one big action sequence and that is the best sequence of the whole movie! The sudden attack part. Then, in the second half, there are a few action scenes more, but all of those are boring or unappealing. The main villain of the movie is like a joke, a result of a work of terrible writing, it wasn't genius, it was ridiculous. Probably the producers including Shane Black wanted the movie to be like The Dark Knight Rises. More realism less fantasy. More drama less action, but Iron Man 3 fails, because it doesn't work in this universe. There are more villains in the movie and mostly they looked ridiculous that somehow reminded me Superman 3. There is one more important villain in the movie and that is dated and cliché. If you haven't seen the movie yet, you may think that if there are many villains in this movie, then the movie is going to be an action feast. No! Also, if you expect a bad-ass villain, I am sorry. In this movie, Tony Stark develops a new technology related to his armor and there are some twists about that. What a terrible, uninspiring idea! There are some moments that kill the spirit or the philosophy of Iron Man, there are some far fetched or exaggerating moments near the end related to Pepper Potts etc. etc. As for Mandarin, Kingsley's performance was amazing, what an actor! As for Jon Favreau, I think he is better as a director than ""funny moments"" tool as an actor. The movie is not funny, it tries to be funny in contrast with the first movie. The first movie was natural like spontaneous, the second and the third one just pushed too far. The first half of the film was pretty boring and uninspiring like the second half of Iron Man 2? Focusing on Bruce Wayne more rather than his alter ego Batman could work, I hate that either, but in this movie, it becomes the fatal mistake! Iron Man 3 is not a superhero movie, it has not comic book feel at all, the cinematography is more like a flat comedy movie except for the visual effects and don't expect Tony Stark fighting as Iron Man throughout the movie! He rarely wears his costume, mostly he runs around as Tony Stark like a detective! The climax of the film was like The A-Team (2010) with some uninspiring action scenes. By the way, the misleading trailer is just another story! Ohh, Tony Stark in the hospital, Ohh, wait, lots of action, this time it looks like a darker film etc. etc. Also there is a big, real big plot hole near the end of the film (if you saw the movie, you know what I mean) In addition, the movie tries to be politic rather than entertaining or fanciful which is beyond terrible! And this is just a guess, the young boy could be The Iron Man of the future like ""Young Indiana Jones"" when Tony Stark gets old, ""quits the job"" or dies. It was just a sense from me.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

","There was no movie in 2013 that brought down the wrath its rabid fan base worse than IRON MAN 3. This is because there is an outspoken demographic, albeit a seemingly small one, who are purists that can't abide changes to the source material and IRON MAN 3 takes some pretty drastic liberties with a classic comic villain. I am not one of these purists and I'm happy to say that IRON MAN 3 was both one of the best movies of the summer and one of the best Marvel Studios films so far. We've got a new director (Shane Black) and a different perspective on the popular character in which we examine Tony Stark and his personal demons as opposed to merely pitting him against another armored baddie. The movie is established after the events of THE AVENGERS with Stark suffering anxiety attacks and insomnia from the mental and emotional strain he suffered during the Chitauri invasion. He's been busy in his workshop to keep his mind off it, and his relationship with Pepper Potts has suffered. A ghost from Stark's past soon reemerges in the form of Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), a fellow scientist and the founder of A.I.M., who hopes to form a partnership with Stark Industries in his research into enhancement nanotechnology and, meanwhile, a terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) has started a campaign of terror against the United States that becomes personal when a close friend of Stark's is caught in the crossfire.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

This movie is more about the character of Tony Stark dealing with his personal issues, and I think that was the right call. His character and his relationsship with Pepper is expanded on in a natural way, and his struggles feel realistic and like a logical progression for him as a character. The movie suffers a bit from a few unnecessary characters and scenes in the middle of the movie, and there are some other pacing issues, but for the most part, the movie is well-structured. It also has a villain with a pretty cool design, even if he is rather bland and boring as a character. The action is well made and has a decent amount of tension as well.

","Iron Man 3 had a lot to live up to, coming off of, one of if not the, best superhero movies ever. Does it succeed? Yes. Marvel's ""Iron Man 3"" pits brash-but-brilliant industrialist Tony Stark/Iron Man against an enemy whose reach knows no bounds. When Stark finds his personal world destroyed at his enemy's hands, he embarks on a harrowing quest to find those responsible. This journey, at every turn, will test his mettle. With his back against the wall, Stark is left to survive by his own devices, relying on his ingenuity and instincts to protect those closest to him. As he fights his way back, Stark discovers the answer to the question that has secretly haunted him: does the man make the suit or does the suit make the man?(Disney) The script is really good, it contains great dialogue, a good interesting plot, great humor and wit, and a bad ass plot twist (More on that later). Robert Downey Jr. is once again incredible as Tony Stark, and everyone else in the cast does good in their roles as well, especially Ben Kingsley. And the film also contains some bad ass action scenes and great special effects. Now to address fan complaints. First of all: This is a look at Tony Stark's character, a look at in his inner demons. Those of you complaining about him not being in the suit enough: You are damn morons. Like, you really need constant action? And now the big one: The plot twist (Spoiler Alert!!!! Please move on to next paragraph if you don't want the plot twist laid out of you). This is a movie IDIOTS!!!!!!!! Naturally they are going to change crap. Let's be honest here: if they had stuck to the comics, and had a stereotypical Chinese terrorist going ""Ah, Iron Man, ah"" China and the rest of Asia would have been in an uproar. You know why? Cause the character of the Mandarin was based off of Asian stereotypes. And comic books and movies are a completely different medium, you have to expect some stuff to change. And the Mandarin story line in the comics was honestly pretty cliché and predictable. This is THE MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE, not the comics. You want the comics? Read the comics. There are a few problems though: The true villain is kind of generic, and the pacing of the film is a little bit too fast for my taste. Iron Man 3 is a great summer blockbuster, a great entry into Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe that kicks it off with a bang, and a worthy follow up to the Avengers.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

60,26 April 2015,scott-sw,9," The Best of the Iron Man
","Iron Man 3 is the best of the franchise. Despite the animosity of many fans, they overlook the gems that make this one really outshine the previous installments. Tony Stark must face himself, his fears, his doubts, and his own anxieties. Troubled with PTSD from the New York incident, he reminisces about duping a quiet, brilliant man and turning him into a desperate, psychotic killer. Stark must deal with this in his present state, which is straining his relationship with Pepper Potts. To deal with his problems, he tinkers with his suits, and hides from reality. Reality hits hard when the Mandarin strikes. A terrorist, the madman is responsible for various bombings in the world. He plays a cat-and-mouse game with the U.S. Rhodes, now the Iron Patriot, seeks the Mandarin while Tony Stark starts on his own trail that leads him to Killian - who has a unique tie to the Mandarin. This leads to a lot of adventure, excitement, and emotions. Many people have griped that this was the same plot as ""The Incredibles,"" but plot devices are often borrowed from other sources. What really makes the plot work, though, is that not everything appears to be what it seems. Another plot strength is we see a more human Tony Stark whose liabilities cause more problems than his strength. He does have to work through the problems of the unintended consequences of previous actions. The one plot weakness was the use of a boy, Harley. Ty Simpkins does play him well, but it seemed unnecessary and a device used to grab kids into the picture. There are a couple of other plot holes and devices that are hackneyed, but the movie still works for a couple of other reasons. One is Robert Downey, Jr. Face it, Tony Stark was the one he was meant to play. He does it well. In this one, he shows some true acting by taking it to another level where Tony Stark has to face himself and reconcile his narcissism and grandiose ego juxtaposed by his PTSD. We also have good performances from Gwenyth Paltrow, Jon Favareau and the villain. Another strength is the direction that takes the plot evenly, and producing a good story with real characters that are not overplayed by the special effects. Iron Man 3 is definitely a good movie, and a rare oddity where the third in a trilogy is the best of the bunch.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

For most of the movie, he's actually not fighting as Iron Man. He's fighting as Tony Stark. He grabs a gun, and actually has good combat skills too. He manages to fight off the Mandrin's henchmen very well, even without the suit. This was a very risky move, but it works out very well if you ask me. He shows that he's not some weakling and if you take away his armor and weapons, he would be an easy target. He shows that he's a tough guy underneath as well. I'm glad they took that route.

This is the first Iron Man movie Jonathan Favreau didn't direct, I really feel that if he had decided to direct the third instalment we would have been given a better movie than this debacle. All in all I frankly thought it was positively dire on all levels. The returning cast members I felt weren't really up to scratch. Special mention to Paltrow who I've always felt was badly miscast as Pepper Potts. The villains I thought were incredibly poor in this one. I really felt there was no meat to their characters whatsoever and no special character trait that would make them awesome villains. Pearce I thought was disappointing but the biggest disappointment was from Ben Kingsley. He basically did what he's been doing for years, pimping himself for Hollywood in substandard movies in insignificant roles that do nothing for his career.

","The superhero blockbuster is a very crowded field and generally one that I now avoid in the cinemas as too often they are not good enough to justify the effort; on DVD at home though, expectations are lower and perhaps they work better even though you lose something of the big screen experience. The Marvel films generally have been the better ones in terms of producing an engaging spectacle which thrills while it makes you laugh and generally encourages you to go along with the plot even though it is very much the stuff of fantasy.

The movie has a WOW factor especially in some scenes including the one in which he saves people falling from the sky. I also liked the idea of controlling his machines (probably the right word for those suits) that too not just one but so many by his brain. One of the movies where you can see it is not just actors but overall crew, technical team, designers and directors are making the movie great.

The movie still has all the great action that you come to expect in an Ironman movie, but still takes time to develop a great story and characters.

","I was very surprised with people criticizing this movie at first, because of the Mandarin twist many people are saying it wasn't as good as they expected it, well we all have different opinions, but to criticize entire movie because of the villain twist which actually fits the movie way better or simply not liking it is somehow in my opinion...well, screams a person never pleased with anything and is very pessimistic and as well as much as I hate to say it didn't ''get'' this movie. *SPOILER ALERT* Let's start off by Tony's panic attacks, considering that in the comics he struggled with alcohol for the younger audience it is way better to make him simply have anxiety issues other than let them see a hot mess drunk Stark, and oh well, he's a normal man, New York left a mark on him, it's understandable. The reason why his suits were a lot ''weaker'' is because they were prototypes, the original 7 or 8 suits he has were way stronger but they couldn't get attached to his body whenever he calls them and didn't have the new special features that he gave these new suits, he didn't yet perfect these suits and do every little detail right when he got attacked, when his house got destroyed the suits we know and see were also destroyed, but the House Protocol was this perfect back up plan he saved for the big moment, he saved it for the moment he will need them the most and that IS to save the president, if he used the protocol straight away when they attacked his house it wouldn't make any sense. Now the villain, as much as I know about the real Mandarin from the comic books, he just in my opinion wouldn't fit in this movie, still they portrayed him as a lunatic terrorist, and no matter how intimidating he looks, he's just another terrorist, and Tony has fought them in the first Iron Man, so this wouldn't be that big of a problem he would find his location and find a way to kill him, Killian is different, his problem with Tony is more on a personal level, and look at it this way, the man has learned how to ''upgrade'' humans DNA, and we all have seen that while it's not perfectly upgraded, after becoming extremist it is very hard to defeat it. This was the first time the villain actually was maybe smarter than Tony, this was the first time Tony had to show off his skills outside of the suit, this was the first time I wasn't so sure will he win at the end, and in my opinion that is what makes this movie very well put all together, finally we see Tony Stark is not invincible, he isn't perfect, he isn't a non emotional son of a bitch that only cares about himself, he takes risks, he makes plans years ahead, and well, his suits are not a distraction or a hobby. His suits are him,he IS Ironman.

It is, in fact, a sequel to Iron Man and Iron Man 2 (which IMHO is a good movie even with its many many flaws). I could go on about the well written characters and great performances, how the whole ""Going back to Tony's suit less roots"" is brilliant and adds more depth to the character, how the film is actually non cliché, how it took an introspective look into the mind of Tony Stark, it gave us more of what really makes Iron Man the man inside or just the suit or even a combination of the two, it helped to move along the greater universe, while still managing to have great standalone quality, it has plenty of depth to it itself, fantastic action with great effects, the sense of actual threat with the Mandarin's character to the the point you know you don't wanna mess with him when you hear that name (at least until the plot twist/reveal which I enjoyed simply for the risk it took and the guts it had to go outside the comfort zone of movies, the casting of Sir Ben Kingsley and Guy pierce for well written villains, brilliant mixture of humor that isn't the least bit forced with drama we care about, pepper not falling into the stereotypical love interest formula and kicking serious butt in the end, the witty and fast paced dialog, and overall a sense of good comic book fun that everyone can enjoy.

","For starters, tony starks character just keeps getting better. They really dive into his mental health in this movie, especially after the events of the first avengers. IT makes the situation more believable as there are real life repercussions of these incredibly epic wars that they have. It also makes him relatable to the viewers as we watch him change from being an egotistical idiot into someone that can easily be pointed out as good, although he does still make some major mistakes in the movie. The plot is great as well, with plenty of great turns and individual character arcs here and there. Its fast paced without disrupting the flow of the movie or being confusing. The villain was probably the weakest point in the film for me. To start he is very intimidating then a big twist happens and the character turns comedic, which works and did get a few laughs from me but felt...idk...a bit silly. Once the real villain is shown, a physical challenge is revealed for tony. His motivations area bit foggy, but I let it slide, he wants power, that's pretty much it. The action though, it exceeds all previous mcu movies, maybe even the avengers...arguably. The final showdown is so awesome, there is an excellent use of characters abilities and moves that they have available.

Hearing that after watching the trailer I was more than hyped to see this film; if for no other reason than enjoying Avengers and hoping they rebound from the horror that was Iron Man 2.

They make an absolute joke out of Mandarin! He's there, but then he's....NOT there. That's the big twist?? The 'villain' in this film turns out to be someone who Tony Stark blows off one New Years Eve years ago who essentially comes back years later with unexplained powers and using a 'boogeyman' as a decoy.

","This movie had literally everything you could imagine. It followed the basic structure of a movie which is to have a beginning, middle and and end. I liked how the director (who is nothing short of a genius) went to 1999 at the beginning of the movie to lay down the foundation. Then it was all Tony Stark aka Robert Downey Jr. This movie had a great protagonist (Tony Stark). The antagonist was not Ben Kingsly but rather Guy Pearce. I could see this coming a kilometer away. But you be the judge. There are many things about the movie that were neat. I loved how Tony had tons of remote control Iron Mans to take on the bad guys. I also loved how Tony Stark was mostly without his IRON MAN for most of the movie and had to rely on his own ability to be a mechanic. This was pure GENIUS. I will say that the bad guys in this movie were basically an ARMY of weirdos who can turn their bodies into fire and that's about it. I wanted to see more of a bad guy. There was also the amazing Donald Cheetah. He was great as War Machine. As he was without his ""suit"" for most of the movie, he had to rely on good old fashioned martial arts. He was trained well and was shown that the enemy will show NO MERCY. I was glad that finally somebody knows this.

","****This Review may contain spoilers**** Iron man 3, a good film from the point of view of a non-marvel viewer like myself. No doubt it was wildly successful, and personally I found it funny, action packed, had a sense of girl power delivered nicely from Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) towards the end, and was just a thoroughly enjoyable film. Although from the point of an avid marvel fan it was a true disappointment, stripping The Mandarin (Ben Kinglsey) of his original evil ways and making him and idiotic and useless tool that is part of a bigger plan; not only that but they got an actor as highly talented as Ben Kinglsey and wasted him on a role with little meaning. However I did really enjoy the comedy The Mandarin brought which complimented Killian Aldrich's (Guy Pearce) evil and malevolent ways. Moving on to the most important person; Tony Stark – played by the one and only amazing Robert Downey Jr. He is hilarious and has brought back another astounding performance from the original Iron Man. While everyone else delivers a great performance, Robert Downey Jr really makes the film how good it is! However it was quite annoying that in the film Iron Man, he spent a little amount of time actually in the suit being Iron Man and more time being Tony Stark. While this is good, I'd still prefer to have seen more of him in the suit, being IRON MAN! This is only a minor bad point and didn't have too much of an effect on the overall film. Like I said it was funny and action packed and just really good to watch. It had impeccable editing and exceptional special effects, plus the Eiffel 65 theme tune was so great! Going back to the view of a Marvel fan, the film was an utter disaster. If you go into this film and expect to see an accurate representation of what was delivered in Stan Lees famous comic books then you will be greatly disappointed. 'The Mandarin' is reduced to nothing more than a druggy who was found on the streets and brought in to act the role; the only good thing is he was played by Ben Kingsley. While it did add an element of humour I still feel it was a bit of a let down from what was expected. Also with him being made into a joke it stripped the film of its main villain and left an empty hole which could only be filled by a true evil source. The whole plot of the film was good, well thought out and followed on nicely from the two previous films – which were also amazing – and continued the whole theme of the trilogy perfectly. Also it was well connected to The Avengers which was good but unless you'd seen The Avengers, like I hadn't the first time I saw this film, then it got a little confusing and felt like I missed something in the second film. This was just a minor setback and was quickly fixed with a little background info from a friend. Finally I felt this film was extremely good, a little confusing but nothing too bad, very funny and I enjoyed it all the way through. From my point of view, a non-marvel fan, it was a great film; but from a serious marvel fan it was a serious let down. I'd recommend that if you want to see an action packed and really good superhero film then this is for you. But if you expect to see an accurate and close follow to the comic books then this isn't really for you. One last note is the final battle, this was seriously amazing! The special effects in it, the amount of money spent on it just everything! The pyrotechnics were something else and just I loved it all so much!

","I am completely disappointed in the portrayal of the Mandarin. The Mandarin, being Iron Man's archenemy and all, turned out to be a persona that Killian (Guy Pierce) invented and Ben Kingsley's Mandarin was nothing more than a decoy. This made me extremely angry considering that I have always liked the Mandarin from the comics. In my opinion, Killian completely differs from what the Mandarin actually is and this also leads to the problem of whether the Mandarin still exist in the movie universe. The action scenes were spectacular but that is about it. The plot twist that Ben Kingsley's Mandarin was just a decoy was definitely meant to be one of the main points of the whole film. However, I just did not like it at all. And everything that follows the plot twist was just action. What I really wanted was a Mandarin based on the comics to carry the plot forward. While I think it's quite unfair to judge a whole movie based on a single character, the portrayal of the Mandarin completely destroyed the film for me and I am extremely disappointed with Marvel/Disney for changing the character.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

But while everyone is getting mad at the villain I think they are missing the point. I (and maybe it was just me) thought #3 was more about Tony and how he grew from this and his problems. While the villain was apart of the story I just think it wasn't supposed to be all about the villain. This film looked at what was important to Tony his suits or an actual life like with Pepper. There is a lot of action but I think people need to look past that and see that there is a lot more going on then just things blowing up.

It's one thing being recognized, and another thing having to grapple with the reality that there are threats larger than life now, which is Tony Stark's perennial bug bear in this installment.

The narrative is easy to follow, and the villains are a lethal lot with a secret about them that enables them to initially gain the upper hand against our hero. Not only does ""Iron Man 3"" serve as a sequel to ""Iron Man 2,"" but it is also a follow-up to ""The Avengers."" Everybody who played somebody in ""Iron Man 2"" returns for this entry.

Nevertheless, only one Avenger makes a cameo, but you'll have to bide your time until the end credits to catch a glimpse of him. Similarly, neither Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) nor Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) turns up for this threquel. Jon Favreau, who helmed the first two ""Iron Man"" epics, has entrusted the franchise now to ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" director Shane Black. Previously known for his violent contemporary crime thrillers, such as ""Lethal Weapon,"" ""The Last Boy Scout,"" and ""Last Action Hero,"" Black imparts a palpable sense of momentum as well as a sense of purpose to this installment. He scored a hit with the Mel Gibson movie ""Lethal Weapon,"" while the other two feature-films languished at the box office. Robert Downey Jr. reprises his role as the obnoxious but heroic inventor Tony Stark who constantly worries about his romantic interest Pepper Potts.

","In 2008, Iron Man ushered in a new era of superhero movies that would push the genre to unbelievable success over the next 5 years. Iron Man 2, although not as strong as the first, proved itself a worthy sequel on the road to The Avengers. Now with The Avengers all assembled, Iron Man 3 kicks off Marvel's second stage of their cinematic universe with a solid, but not amazing film, much like Iron Man 2 was to Iron Man 1. Let's get the negatives out of the way. The number one problem with this movie, and the reason it could turn hardcore fans off, is the plot, or more specifically, the number of plot holes. There are a few of them, and I'll skim through them quickly. First off, while this is a stand alone Iron Man movie, the cloud of the Avengers was hanging over the movies head the entire film. The main villain, The Mandarin (who I'll talk more about shortly) is a terrorist who is severely threatening America's national security. You'd think that maybe Captain America might be able to help out with this crisis because, I don't know, he has America in his name! And we know he exists in the same world as Iron Man,and his job is to protect the stars and stripes right? My point is that although this is an Iron Man movie, now that the Avengers has been released I fear that all of the stand alone movies could suffer from the same question that this movie has; where are the rest of the guys? Second, is the villain. When Ben Kingsley was announced to play Iron Man's greatest foe, I was pumped. The trailers looked awesome and in the first half of the movie, The Mandarin is a scary and fun bad guy. But this all changes with a plot twist that totally makes you do a face palm. Following this twist, the movie just isn't the same, and is hard to take seriously. There are other plot holes that I'll avoid talking about due to spoilers and length, but there are a few more. Besides the plot, the only other complaints I have is that there simply was not enough action from Iron Man himself and when there was, it was fast and minimal. Iron Man never gave off that super bad ass vibe that he did in the first movie, but still was awesome in his own way.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

The lame bad guys seemed to overpower ironman quite easily and the amount of suits that were ripped to shreds left me wondering, are they made of plastic now?

The movie was great for the first hour, I was loving it, aside from the BS writing. That twist, that stupid twist that ruined the whole movie. Lets give you a back drop. You've seen the trailer, it looked dark, it reminded me of the Drak Knight Rises. The Mandarian, he was the equivalent of Bane, more Badass and powerful than Stark. I mean the Mandarian was a big part of why I went to see this instead of waiting for the Blu-ray to come out. He could have been one of the best villains in the last decade, but they threw that idea straight out the window, just for a little comedy. This film should be in the comedy genre instead. Cheap humour, to be honest, I didn't find it that funny, but the general audience sure did. They tricked the audience, and how does the audience react, oh it's just a joke, lets laugh. I bet the writers thought they were real clever when they wrote that twist in. It's sad, up until that twist, the Mandarian was dare I say scary, just like Bane. Those news broadcast worked. Ben Kingsley was perfect, until he just turned out to be a drug addicted actor. Instead we get some generic douche bag villain, with little to no motivation for his cause, he comes equipped with atrocious dialogue as well. I'm sorry Guy Pierce, but your character was bargain bin quality. What else is there to complain about besides the worst twist in cinema history, lame as lame can be villain, and kiddie humour. Well apparently the iron man suits are made of paper mache, they fall apart like roast beef. But in the avengers, it can withstand any abuse you could imagine putting it through. This movie is just bad all around, even though I don't like the avengers, I at least have to say that it was miles better than this film. Here is what you have to do, watch the trailer before you go see the film, go see the film, and make up your mind on whether you were tricked, mislead, disheartened or just insulted as a viewer.

","Coming off The Avengers, this film feels as broken as Tony's suits. It has memorable moments, such as Tony's time in a garage in Tennessee, but in the end it falls flat. Unlike many other MCU films, I enjoyed the second act more than the first and third. Character motivations seemed disjointed and inconsistent (such as Pepper's sympathy followed by random angry outbursts at Tony). My biggest problem with Iron Man 3 was the finale. First, why did Tony wait until the end to unleash his army of suits? There were plenty of crucial moments (drowning after his house was destroyed, wandering through snow in Tennessee, etc.) when he could have used the suits even more. Second, why were they so fragile and easily destroyed? In other films, the suits can withstand Thor's lightning and alien blasts but now they disintegrate from melty fire hands. Third, so Tony could have removed the shrapnel in his chest at any time? Wasn't he just dying from the stuff in Iron Man 2? Iron Man 3 felt like the filmmakers were trying to have big ""moving"" moments rather than follow a logical plot with clear motivations for actions.

215,27 April 2013,ajinkya-nazare07,4," Most disappointing marvel movie EVER!
","Let me start by stating the obvious. The movie was super-hyped, the trailers misleading and the story turned out to be something else (and not good at all). Shane Black must have thought that the twist about the Mandarin would blow people's minds but the only thing it did was cause frustration and disappointment. What was he thinking while destroying and ridiculing the best and most menacing villain in the Iron Man universe?! What in the world happened to his 10 rings and every ring having a different power? Imagine if the Joker comes out to reveal that he's just some joker hired from some circus and the real mind behind him is Sal Maroni! To make things worse and humiliate the Mandarin, Aldrich Killian says ""I am the Mandarin"". Seriously, Shane Black has totally destroyed what could've been a 9.0+ rated movie instead turning it to be a comical mishap. And plot holes.. Plot holes everywhere! His suit is supposed to be made out of a gold and titanium alloy and it breaks into pieces when it gets hit by a truck?! It felt more of a love story than a superhero movie. If he knows he can summon all his suits, why did he wait to call them in the climax instead of doing that when his house is getting blown to shreds? That is not Iron Man, he doesn't wait to destroy when he knows he already has the firepower. Robert Downey Jr. has delivered a good performance though. Ben Kingsley is totally wasted! I don't know why he even accepted the role. Aldrich Killian can never look as demented as the Mandarin, especially after the reveal, and so even a great actor like Guy Pearce was wasted. And for a seemingly ""most important thing in"" Tony Stark's life, Pepper Pots was not seen much in the movie and in the end she's the one killing Killian! WHAAAAAAT?! In all, the movie is certainly NOT for the dedicated comic readers who'd literally scream after the stupidity of Shane Black destroying the Mandarin and making a small character like Aldrich Killian the prime antagonist. He should have just stuck to the original story line by modifying it such that it didn't affect the Mandarin-Iron Man rivalry. Extremely disappointing movie.

","I was looking forward to seeing this movie so much, but walked away very disappointed. It's not that I thought it a bad movie, I have sure seen worse in all my years. It just left me very unsatisfied. Firstly, we have now had three Iron Man movies where a principal villain is a corrupt industrialist. Can the writers not think up anything new? I also felt their treatment of the character of The Mandarin was just woeful. The Mandarin, Iron Man's arch foe, being reduced to an almost comical character was uncalled for. They may as well have made The Red Skull a clown in Captain America. Wouldn't a big screen CGI clash between Iron Man and the true Mandarin been better, or as least as good as, the clash we ended up with in the finale of this movie? Some of these Hollywood types need to realize that we don't have to have a big song and dance to explain why a villain is a villain. A super hero movie is a fantasy adventure with lots of action, so all the villain really has to do is be bad enough for you to really root for the hero. Here's a simple plot line. The Mandarin is enslaving Chinese peasants for some nefarious plan, and the Chinese government can do nothing about it. In the hope of strengthening US/Chinese relations the Chinese government, knowing that the US has super heroes, asks the US government for help. The US send Iron Patriot, who is ambushed, defeated, and imprisoned by The Mandarin. Iron Man decides to intervene not only to rescue his friend, but to free the enslaved peasants, which he does. No corrupt politicians, no evil industrialists, just two straight up drag 'em out fights between the good guys, Iron Patriot and then Iron Man, versus The Mandarin. Simple, and something even kids understand. After all, just how many 15 year olds understand industrial espionage and the like? Just keep it simple. This movie will of course make money, it is Iron Man after all. People who have been reading about and watching super heroes for decades, like me, will always want to see them on the big screen regardless. Still, I truly don't believe that this movie deserves the box-office receipts that it will get, and judging by the reaction of the people in the cinema with us, I think a lot of other people will feel the same.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

Stark grapples with the fallout of past decisions and has to decide who he is at his core without the money or Iron Man. As expected the entire cast dazzles in their performances from Robert Downey Jr. To Don Cheadle to Gwyneth Paltrow, but the true standout is Ben Kingsley's Mandarin.

","*Contains Spoilers* I can't believe this film was even considered with this obnoxious storyline. Mandarin, Iron Man's arch-nemesis, is made to look like a complete useless idiot. Their intellect (in the comics) is evenly matched but Iron Man 3 showed us that Mandarin was working on his project for 13 years and could not figure out a way to stabilise it where Tony Stark almost figured it out in one night, when he was drunk. He later figured it out completely to save Pepper, without breaking a sweat. If that wasn't enough of a kick to the groin, Tony has reoccurring stupid decisions throughout the film. From giving the terrorists his home address to taking the only suit that wasn't combat ready to trusting a little kid with his only suit to destroying all of his 42 suits for no reason. One another major thing that annoyed me was his constant panic/anxiety attacks. It was just painful to watch a hero cower and replay memories of himself from the ending scenes of The Avengers, added nothing to the story and was just useless. If anything, shouldn't one of his priorities be to keep all the suits in case of alien danger, the thing he kept cowering about? There was also major inconsistencies with Mandarin's henchmen and the damage they could do to the suits. ",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013
253,3 May 2013,generationfilm,5," Shane Black's Dark Humor and Verbal Wit isn't Enough to Save This Formulaic Ruination of the Original Comic
","Marvel's ridiculous dogmatic hold on their chosen formulaic plot structure for their films hasn't yielded the best products when it comes to their character specific adventures, especially in upholding untouchable comic book material and characters. After the atrocity that was Iron Man 2, where Jon Favreau tinkered with not only one but two villain interpretations Whiplash and Crimson Dynamo, it was clear that the reins of control might have to change hands in order to preserve the shreds of positive creativity that were rather limited. The decision to hire director/screenwriter Shane Black wasn't an odd one because his incredible sharp wit would definitely compliment the narcissistic persona of Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark and has been evident before through penning the Lethal Weapon franchise and in his directorial debut Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. But not even the darkly humoristic additions or the frenetic action sequences could salvage the complete bastardization of the comic in relation to the utter ruination of Iron Man's devout nemesis, the Mandarin. Basically Iron Man 3 squanders needed guidance from its comic book source by completely ignoring its merits creating a storyline that is practically insulting to dedicated readers and longtime fans. What becomes crystal clear throughout the latest Iron Man installment is that Disney, with their unfettered franchise building of Marvel material, really doesn't care about original fans and seem to be quite antagonistic towards their love of the origins and characters in the comics themselves. There's no doubt that many desensitized moviegoers will find a great deal of enjoyment through Downey's witty banter and Shane Black's kinetic yet hollow action sequences, but the limitations posed by the Marvel formula is a creative barrier that needs to be eliminated. It never mattered who was piloting this cinematic suit, whether it was Jon Favreau or newcomer Shane Black, because the real villain behind the curtain is Disney and Marvel itself since their focus on potential merchandise in gadgetry has diminished the creative soul and drive of their pictures. Franchises might make money but sometimes, or most times when it comes to Marvel films, they make fools of us all when they claim ignorance to the original comics and create travesties of epic proportions much like Iron Man 3.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

I thought that it was also nice to see Tony's relationship with Pepper grow as well while dealing with their own relationships issues.

After all, wouldn't the individual character films feel a bit... small after that? IM3 attempts to use that to its advantage by making it smaller on purpose. It's a character study with a bit of spectacle slapped on, and I do mean ""bit"". While the third act does follow the standard ""Stuff go boom!"" formula, the first two thirds of the film keeps the action rather conventional (with one notable exception). To make this work you need an actor who can hold the audience's attention. Thankfully IM3 has the ultimate ace in the hole in Robert Downey Jr. But even his unmatched charisma can merely Spackle over the film's many flaws. The story is weak, the stakes feel small and it just never builds any momentum. There are a lot of things to like here.

","As you can tell by username, I'm a fan of a certain comic book character whom this (terrible) movie have ruined. However, I don't want to make it look as if the only thing that is wrong with this movie is how it mishandles that character - hell no. This movie is bad, no doubt. But the reason why it's bad has nothing to do with the way this movie mishandles that particular character. My main gripe about this movie is the script. The script is awful by all accounts. I understand that not every comic book movie can have a well-written script that is on the level of Nolan's Batman films, but I at least expect something tolerable. This? This is JUNК! A big, stinky, poorly put together JUNК. The characters are inept caricatures with no personalities. The story is basically Incredibles meets Lethal Weapon, but only it's not as fun or entertaining as those movies. It must really suck if you as a screenwriter can't make your own movie and you have to steal ideas from lame cartoon that was made decade ago. But besides terrible screenplay - make no mistake - the movie has the most incompetent direction imaginable. Even with a bad script you can make decent movie if you are capable filmmaker. Unfortunately, whatever credentials Shane Black had in the past, it doesn't matter here. Here, his awful direction is unbearable. The tone is flimsy, the character interaction is lame, the story structure is poorly connected. If you had told me that this movie was directed by a crippled dog with a brain tumor, I would believe you. But, what is also terrible, is that Robert Downey Jr. doesn't care anymore. His acting is mediocre at very best. There is no emotional impact from his acting. It feels very superficial and forced. And now, imagine, that besides all those glaring problems, you also have the twist with the main villain - The Mandarin. The Mandarin twist in this movie is the equivalent to this: imagine if you had big pile of crаp, and then on top of that pile of crаp someone would had poured a bucket of pіss. That's basically the definition of Mandarin's twist in this movie. All in all, if you want a good Iron Man vs. Mandarin story, that is fun, entertaining, smart, and action-packed, go get trade paperbacks of Enter The Mandarin, Dragon Seed Saga, Hands of the Mandarin, Revenge of the Mandarin, and The Future.

He is really a wonderful comedian with the ability to mix the comedy with a certain amount of vulnerability. This is a rare and precious gift at a time when most screenplays march their characters through wooden, pedestrian dialogue that only functions to move the characters from one plot development to another. For Downey, it is such a unique gift that, while you're watching Iron Man Three, you realize that he alone is keeping the movie from becoming a crushing bore.

","After the events of 2012 summer blockbuster The Avengers, there were some really big shoes to fit, for the new Iron Man movie and its director Shane Black. Sadly, it's was too big for him. I had high hopes for the film, and it felt like just another mediocre lazy popcorn flick. The movie based on the ""Extremis"" story arc by Warren Ellis comic book, but it's loosely. The movie starts after the events of The Avengers, a haunted Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) start to have panic attacks due to the 'trauma' of the alien invasion and his near-death experience. Yes, Tony Stark started having panic attacks, yet he is able leap off 20 story buildings, fight crime, and save the world yet again from the evil Mandarin (Ben Kingsley). Wow, those near-death experience is really stopping him. Not! Talking about the Mandarin, if you are a comic book fan. You will be deeply disappointed by finding out who he truly is. At first, the movie made him out to be one of the greatest superhero villains of all time, but they really ruin it for a twist ending, and stupid humor. Without spoiling the movie, let's just say, that the real villain is somebody else in the film. While there is a string of bombings by terrorists, I surprised there was no mention of S.H.I.E.L.D or what the other Avengers were doing while this was happening. They did had a cameo from one of the Avengers after the ending Credits. I know they didn't have the actors plan for this film, but they could have at less note one or two lines what they were doing around this time. I would have thought that would be a big deal for S.H.I.E.L.D since the Mandarin is planning to kill the President, and make super soldiers with the Extremis, an alien biologic weapon. Well, we know what Tony Stark is spend doing some of the movie, and it's rarely being Iron Man. Stark spend most of the time hanging out in Tennessee for some odd reason with a kid that looks like Carl from Walking Dead name Harley. In truth, he's barely in the suit even with the highlight action scenes like the jet plane action rescue. Honestly, if people get suck out of a jet plane, I think they would die once they leave the airplane due to the high pressure. If not they would have at less freeze and pass out. Still, it was pretty good action scene. The supporting cast of Guy Pearce, Don Cheadle, and Gwyneth Paltrow work within their means. The movie use Gwyneth Paltrow more in this film less than Damsel in distress, but more like the wife from the movie High Noon. The ending to the film wasn't that good in my opinion. I wonder now how he will join the Avengers 2 if there is any. The story was meant as a sort of ""new start"" for the character -to redefine him from his origins as an arms dealer, to be the ""test pilot for the future"". Ellis intended him to be a better superhero, so I understand what they were saying, but I also believe it had something else to say. The reason they made the movie how they did is because Robert Downey Jr's contract is ending after this movie. He may sign a new contract but that is in discussion. Marvel wanted to leave their options open for new cast if that is the way they go. I personally think Iron Man wouldn't have been such a success without Robert Downey, he made the movie great and plays the character awesome. It's hard not to see him in the role. It paled in comparison to the other two. I wonder how many fans tuned in to see an epic battle between Iron man and his nemesis The Mandarin and got screw. The Mandarin is Iron Man's most famous foe in the comics mainly because he's been around the longest, and now it's wasted. I Love the actors and special effects, but that's just false advertising.

Apart from the fact that the story loses some focus because of all the pyrotechnics and action - the noise even drowned out Pepper's death which should have been a very emotional scene - it's very unsatisfying. The appeal of IM3 should have been that Tony manages to take out his enemies on his own, without his laboratory and suits and money, and they started that off pretty OK by destroying his home base, and even the scenes in Malibu ran along that line and were pretty OK. But at the story's climax, we learn that he still has an army of suits at his disposal, hidden away until the last 10 minutes of the story?! What were they thinking?! What was HE thinking?!

","Obviously one of the most anticipated blockbusters of the year. It's always very important for any movie in a franchise to do well after a big movie, such as the event that was ""The Avengers"". But IM3 totally exceeded the expectations and proved that we fans had nothing to worry about. It combines all the best things from the previous two Iron Man films, with a story and a cast that was still original enough to make for a great movie. Also, the entire Iron Man franchise is very rooted in the ideas of self-destruction and regret. Therefore, if you pay attention to these themes in all three films, then you notice a progressive full-circle kind of thing. The first Iron Man introduced us to the character of Tony Stark and his genius, but there were slight implications of self-destruction in that if he didn't figure out something to do with all of his money and technology, then he would never be able to make up for all the mistakes he made as a weapons supplier/dealer. In IM2, he absolutely has to figure out how to fix his relationships with others and the problem with his arc reactor, or he will most certainly die and regret how he didn't fix them. And now, in Iron Man 3, his obsession with building all these different suits and using them to save the world has finally come back around to bite him in the butt, and he has to figure how to fix it all by himself. This leads to some very welcome flashbacks from Tony's experiences in ""The Avengers"". The film's big twist is surprising and very well thought out/set up. Others have said that this totally eliminates the entire idea of the villain, but the film makes it clear that the villain still exists within the film, just in an unexpected way. Besides, when anyone feels that the physical villain of the film does not satisfy, they can always rely on that self-destructive factor of Tony himself. That is also a villain, even if it's just in the metaphorical sense. Shane Black's direction makes sure there is a definite balance between action, great emotion/feeling, and some comedy. At times in the film, all of these things will exist in one scene, usually one right after the other. Unsurprisingly, RDJ turns in a terrific job once again. The rest of the cast also does a great job, especially Paltrow and Pearce. IM3 also doesn't disappoint in the general sense of the franchise. While Iron Man was and still is a great movie, Iron Man 2 was all over the place and never did really find a central theme, but there were certain parts of it that were very good and somewhat made up for where it fell short. Now, Iron Man 3 has absolutely wowed the socks off all its appreciative fans, and still is, according to the box office numbers. It featured what we loved from the first Iron Man in spades, while still kicking all of that up a notch with a much stronger central theme. Therefore, it is the best in the series for me.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

While I read comic books as a child, I never really let them dictate my very existence. My pain has been watching the Minnesota Vikings for 50 years and having them never win a Super Bowl. The angst over this movie is nearly startling. To make the fact that the studio took liberties with the characters may be disappointing, but the sun will come up tomorrow. I taught literature for over 40 years and I never saw a movie that aligned well with a book. Granted, some movies were actually improvements. Most of the time they were not. Since I didn't know Manderin, I didn't go in thinking he was Iron Man's sworn enemy. The rules were changed and the villains altered. I thought it was a very exciting movie. It had all the cliffhanging events required of an adventure. Special effects allow us a range of spectacle we could not have imagined. Downey and his smug, aloof being are quite delightful. And I felt for the most part that things went as they should. I have seen the other two movies and thought they were also fun. Unlike the fanboys, I don't have the energy to figure out the rule being followed by the players. I need to know how to defeat this guy who has evolved to a horrible force. That is, if you hit him with an i-beam 600 times, which one kills him, or do they kill him? We aren't told. Or are we? Part of any plot or quest is that the hero must face his own shortcomings and rise to the task and (now get this) with knowledge of what it takes, defeat evil. Much like the mercury man in Terminator 3, I was not sure exactly what needed doing; do we melt him, crush him, dismember him, throw him in a pit of molten metal. I don't know.

","To begin with, I really enjoyed the first two Iron Man movies. I'm also an avid comic book fan. However, I do understand that things can't be exactly the same in the movies as they were in the comics, and I see why, it's pretty self-explanatory. What they did in this movie was just plain STUPID. Spoiler alert, but truth be told the only thing that can be spoiled is disappointment. The first, I think hour of the movie was actually going well. They present the ""mandarin"" (notice the quotations), we don't see much of him, but we see enough to think ""damn, this guy's no joke"". They set him up as this ruthless terrorist, and of course you think he's the main villain. You're wrong, and I was wrong, it turns out the character that Ben Kingsley plays is actually a drunken idiot actor (yes, an actor playing an actor) named trevor who was hired by the real main villain i.e. Guy Pearce's character to make these stupid movie clips to send to the media that show 'the mandarin' committing terrorist acts, and that is NO JOKE. Now I know that The Mandarin isn't super well-known, and that Iron Man doesn't have a particularly revered cast of bad guys, but neither does The Hulk, and they managed to make The Abomination pretty awesome in The Inredible Hulk. The character Yinsen; who helped Tony Stark make his first armor in the first movie, makes a small appearance in a flashback, then he is completely not even heard of again. Now I think it would have been pretty cool to see how Yinsen was involved with The Mandarin, since he was captured by The Ten Rings terrorist group (Mandarin wore ten rings by the way), and then maybe have Tony Stark go back to fight the Ten Rings camp and discover their true leader; The Mandarin, something along those lines. Something that involved the Ten Rings, Yinsen (since he did have a cameo), and of course THE REAL MANDARIN. The fact that they made him look so menacing at first and then reveal him to be a hoax is extremely tasteless, whether or not you were looking forward to The Mandarin, what they did was STUPID STUPID STUPID STUPID!!!!!!!!!!!

Where the previous two films were filled with humor, action and suspense, this one leaves you depressed and wanting more. This is by far the least humorous of the three and if anyone has seen the previous films, they would know that humor was essential to the success of these movies. The new director here tried to take a chance and ultimately failed by screwing up what was essentially a good formula for these movies. It almost seems unnatural that this movie takes itself so seriously when the others were fairly light-hearted.

364,22 February 2017,mounirrmaged,1," Worst MARVEL movie to date, absolutely terrible
","Iron man 3 is the 7th installment in the marvel cinematic universe, directed by Shane Black (Kiss kiss bang bang). The film follows Tony Stark being torn apart mentally while facing a terrorist, the mandarin. He starts an odyssey of rebuilding and retribution. When you read it like this, it can come as a powerful, dramatic conflict that can leap the boundaries of comic book movies to a whole new level. Sadly it doesn't. The biggest problem that people seem to have with this movie is the mandarin (We will get to that later). People seem to be very mixed about the way the mandarin was represented in the film. My two cents is that it is utter stupidity. Tony Stark in the film is a completely unlikable asshole. He has no charm, no charisma or any weight. The character is supposed to face a deep, mental conflict which is PTSD due to the events of the avengers, but that is embarrassingly downplayed. This conflict gives no emotional substance or levity. The way it is handled is completely superficial. In other films, such conflicts can be presented and supported by other elements of film making, such as camera movements, sound editing, crazy visuals and great acting. Unfortunately none of these elements are used in the film. They simply use a close-up shot and rely entirely on Robert Downey Jr.'s acting skills, which are terrible and hold no emotional value. All he does is staring and throw quips. The PTSD is also there as a plot device, appearing only when it is needed to, but never really doing anything to the character. Tony gets a nightmare, makes foolish decisions that almost cost his life and his loved ones, but it is all presented in a very dull way. It doesn't also help with RDJ's one note acting who can't do any dramatic performances. Another poor aspect of the film is the tone. The tone ranges from pretentious edginess to a Mel Brooks action spy comedy by the end. The movie has no idea what kind of theme or layer it wants to represent.

","Arriving before its North American landing, IRON MAN 3 pulls off a momentous debuting in its international market, I saw it in a plain 2D version and, about this franchise, IRON MAN (2008, 8/10) is a left field coup, a middle-aged superhero to clinch the youth-dominated market, only Robert Downey Jr. could nail it with dapper openness and wisecracking debonair. So within six years span, a fourth cranked-out (if one counts THE AVENGERS 2012, 5/10) comes on strong this year to ignite the summer powder keg. Personally I skipped IRON MAN 2 (2010) though I still possess the DVD, and the only reason why IRON MAN 3 interests me is the Chinese element, reportedly three Chinese actors are on the slate of the cast, Xueqi Wang, Bingbing Fan and Jing Wu, but it turned out to be an utter scam, only Xueqi Wang appeared in about 3 seconds in 2 fleeting scenes with one line ""Nihao"" (""hello"" in Mandarin) and so is Ben Kingsley's ""The Mandarin"", the ostensible ringleader of the terrorists (more Al-Qaeda than mandarin).

","The first film was really good, the second film was a tiny bit of a let down, but I heard this third film was an improvement, and I saw that it was rated well by the critics, so I went to the cinema to see it, from director Shane Black (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang). Basically the film starts with a flashback to a New Years Eve party in 1999 where Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) was with female scientist Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall), who invented the experimental regenerative treatment called Extremis, which intended to recover severely injured people. At the party Tony was invited by disabled and nerdy looking scientist Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), who owns company Advanced Idea Mechanics (AID), to have a place in the company, but he rejects the offer, and saying he would meet him later leaves him humiliated. Forwarding to the present day, Tony is still recovering from the events during the alien invasion in New York (during Avengers Assemble) and having panic attacks, so he has built several Iron Man suits to relieve himself, but this is also creating friction between him and his girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Meanwhile a series of bombings by a terrorist called The Mandarin (Sir Ben Kingsley) with no forensic evidence left behind at the scenes has left intelligence agencies bewildered, but when Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau), security chief of Stark Industries, is injured, that is when Tony threatens the terrorist on television. Tony says for the Madarin to come and get him, he is later visited by Hansen who comes to warn him of danger, and the terrorist responds to the televised threat by sending helicopter gunships to destroy the Stark house, but he saves Hansen and Pepper from the attack. Escaping the attack in one of his suits Tony blacks out and crashes somewhere in Tennessee, where a bombing took place, following the crash the suit or experimental armour has no sufficient power to get him back to California, and everyone believes that he is dead. He gets help from ten year old Harley Keener (Ty Simpkins) in investigating the incident in the town, the explosion has all the similarities to a Mandarin attack, and he deduces from his technological thinking that soldiers subjected to Extremis have reacted badly to the effects and it caused them to explode, he witnessed this with agents Ellen Brandt (Stephanie Szostak) and Eric Savin (James Badge Dale) attacking him. With the boy's help Tony traces the location of the Mandarin to Miami, but meeting the dangerous looking man from television Tony is surprised that he is actually a British born actor named Trevor Slattery, the Mandarin is a creation of the true villain, now good looking and Extremis cured Killian. When Tony is captured by Killian, the villain tells him that he has kidnapped Pepper, and that she has been subjected to Extremis as a blackmail to force him to help the improve the effects of the experiment, Hansen is killed for having a change of heart, and Colonel James Rhodes (Don Cheadle), formerly War Machine now re-branded as the Iron Patriot, is lured into a trap to steal his armour. Tony manages to escape and help Rhodes, he knows that the plan by Killian is to use and control the Iron Patriot suit to attack President Ellis (William Sadler) aboard Air Force One, so the two heroes head for the impounded damaged oil tanker where the villain is hiding out. Going against the numerous henchmen Tony activates all of his suits, and controlled by JARVIS (voiced by Paul Bettany) they fight the thugs, while Rhodes rescues the President, before saving Pepper who has survived the Extremis effects. Killian is trapped in one of the Iron Man suits to be self destroyed, but this fails to kill him, but Pepper intervenes with her newfound powers and he is killed, and to prove his dedication to her Tony orders JARVIS to destroy all the armour suits, the shrapnel embedded in his heart is removed in surgery, and he throws his obsolete chest arc reactor into the sea, but remarks he will always be Iron Man. Also starring Ashley Hamilton as Jack Taggert, Dale Dickey as Mrs. Davis, Miguel Ferrer as Vice President Rodriguez, Xueqi Wang as Doctor Wu, Shaun Toub as Ho Yinsen, Bill Maher, Joan Rivers, Stan Lee as Pageant Judge and Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner in a post credits sequence. Downey Jr. is still likable being knowledgeable and jokey, Pearce is a great choice as the knowingly nasty villain, Kingsley is great being deceptive and amusing, and supporting cast members Paltrow and Cheadle get their good moments as well. The story is much better worked out than the previous, the fight and destruction sequences are engaging, especially the house attack and final fight, the special effects are really cool with all the suits in action, technological gadgets and explosions, there is plenty of fun to be had with this terrific fantasy action adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Very good!",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

","There was quite a lot of hype going for this flick. Especially since it's a superhero movie and because it's the third or fourth installment for this superhero in movies. And despite the hype I thought this flick was alright but just isn't as epic or grand or even all that entertaining as I thought it would be. I mean it was a fun watch and didn't get bored of it like in ""Iron Man 2"" but just isn't all that great either. The final battle in this where like over 40 Iron Man suits come together to fight the bad guys is cool and all. And thus worth the admission, but the build up is a bit disappointing. Not awful or anything but kinda disappointing. There wasn't much Iron Man in the previous ""Iron Man"" movies but I think there is just enough of Iron Man in this one but barely passable. There is however a long gap showing Tony Stark investigating and trying to figure out a way to beat the villains without his suit. It's cool how they tried to make Tony use his intelligence which is his main weapon, instead of the Iron Man suit. Since Tony Stark despite his genius level intelligence has no powers. But just wasn't done in a way where it seems all that intelligent, clever or awesome. Very watchable but isn't impactful, despite him going all MacGyver on one part. And the main twist in this is alright during the watch but after it's finished and I started to think about it and then it started to irritate me a bit. The Mandarin is not only a iconic villain in the Marvel universe but it's Iron Man's archenemy. Like how The Joker is the archenemy to Batman. And both villains broadcasts themselves, except The Joker met the audiences expectations when Batman faced The Joker and it was freaking awesome. This one decides to give the audiences a middle finger after the trailer hyped up this villain. This movie completely screwed him over for a twist and in my opinion the sacrifice wasn't worth the twist. I don't know if they wanted to make this movie unique or was anxious for a twist. There would have been plenty of ways to throw a few curve balls at the audiences and not tick them off. Especially when a movie like this has a budget over 200 million. And would have made the final showdown more meaningful. Here is a idea, since the final battle in this flick has over 40 Iron Man suits battling. They could have made it so the Iron Man suits was used to use as offense or defense against The Mandarin's Ten Rings of Power, since each suit has their own special sets of skills. And it would absolutely would have been cool to watch. Few new characters also adds to this movie in a positive manner though...Mostly. It's a entertaining watch but just wasn't as entertained as I hoped to be and just didn't find it all that exciting.

The rest of the movie is rubbish, pathetically attempting to be 'oh so serious' as Tony Stark tries to to work his way out of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder from 'Avengers Assemble' action in New York. And doesn't he make a meal ( a very pathetic one ) out of it. By the end Robert Downey Jnr looks bored stiff and we have long lost interest! Again this is one of those blockbusters that has to have a CGI action scene whenever the writers/director thinks the audience is getting bored. The plot is a tired retread of the lunatic mad disappointed scientist (Guy Pierce) trying to bring the USA to its knees with a fake terrorist (amusingly played by Ben Kingsley). While Tony Stark is wandering around the Mid West (like Superman when he lost his powers!) trying to find answers and himself. The plot requires you not to understand who the bad zombie-like 'blow yourself up' terrorists are or what are the limits of their capabilities - because some can be killed and others magically regenerate!

The plot is actually very interesting and unique the antagonists are a big part of the film there's 2 (kind of) one at first is extremely well done and threatening and seems like he could be a top tier antagonist then a major twist happens and it kinda ruins the potential the antagonist had which is unfortunate, however we do have a second pretty decent antagonist aswell who poses a threat to Tony Stark and has decent motivations and is kinda interesting. The fights scenes can be quite good but others can be awkward and hard to follow the final fight in particular however is really great the choreography and cinematography in the final fight is amazing to watch. In terms of comedy the jokes can be extremely funny but others dont land at all.

In the Ironman 3 man is capable only of punching around and making noise! We shouldn't forget the dance of the uniforms in the end. Ironman jumps in the air from the one uniform to the other. The uniforms fly in the air above his head, and Ironman leaves the one uniform, jumps from the terrace down, falls inside an empty uniform, flies up to the top again, leaves the uniform, and jumps again to catch another uniform. And again, and again. It may look well as a picture, but what's the possibility of this ridiculous exaggeration to happen in reality? And it's not even a first! We have seen similar scenes in James Bond (jumps and catches airplane), in Star Wars, even in the 5th Element with Bruce Willis! Art is the prototype, the cheap impromptu imitation isn't!

","Iron Man and his alter-ego, billionaire philanthropist Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) are back in a big way after the events of The Avengers, and it's clear Stark feels a little out of place in a world with gods, alien invasions, and Hulks. Captain America's line to Stark in the film: ""Big man in a suit of armor. Take that off, what are you?"" resonates in Iron Man 3 as Stark seems haunted by his alter-ego and whether or not it defines him. The film sets out to answer this question; it is far more about Tony Stark than it is about Iron Man, so anyone who went into the film expecting the opposite left disappointed. Stark's character arc concludes magnificently in the film, and if this were the only merit on which it were to be judged, it'd be five stars out of five. Sadly, the film that surrounds this wonderful piece of cinema is drowned out by a colossal red herring, throw-away characters, and wasted opportunities.

I liked the battles with the bads and the chemistry between all the characters. Im not putting many details, but I will say I have always liked Shane Black and his signature is ALL OVER this movie. From the Christmas theme, to the plucky kid its all there. Im sorry but it just works, if you like to laugh and enjoy fun then this movie will be the best thing out this summer.

Judging by the money that the movie made, the audiences obviously are into this franchise, but I was expecting some reference to the Avengers or at least, Samuel L.

In Iron Man 3 they made him a somewhat threatening terrorist.

Jon Favereau fared well the first two creating a grandiose, sarcastic, sassy mouthed but fantastical universe filled with big characters people have loved spending time with. The first one is still the best in my opinion, it lost a little luster in the sequel but this follow up entry brings the franchise into it's smaller, more character driven roots which is much appreciated and changes the overall effect. The film humanizes Tony Stark played by the lovably jerky Robert Downy Jr. as he lashes out at a terrorist and suffers the consequences when he is attacked at home. Most of his equipment is destroyed and his girlfriend Pepper is nearly killed. Presumed dead by the public he moves ahead trying to solve the villains mystery and begin to rebuild his machinery so to speak. There's lots of clever quips and even emotionally resonant add ons. the humor is there for the most part but doesn't feel as funny but the action sequences are truly breathtaking. And there is finally a kick ass character arc for Pepper Potts played with a seductive ferocity by Gwyneth Paltrow. I'm not sure how well it holds up to the original material or even if it makes all that much sense but it is grade A entertainment and most of all it shows that the franchise is growing in a more adult direction a brave act in a slew of constant cinematic immaturity. 3.5/5",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

This movie answers the legendary question that , weather ' Man makes the suit or Suit makes the man' And the answer has been brilliantly been given by Mr.Shane Black, with the help from our beloved 'Tony Stark' and his associates - Pepper,Rhodes and Happy. I personally think that Robert Downey Jr. Is an enigma ......give him a dead role and still he will light it up like fire , in fact in both the earlier installments ,he has underplayed his potential but In this one Mr.Black has allowed him to perform beyond the suit . I guess , what Nolan tried with Batman trilogy and what Sam Mendes did with Skyfall this one is on the same path , showing that Heroes also bleed ,they cry ,they fail and they are as vulnerable. As for the villains ,weather , it's the Mandarin or Aldrich Killian - Mr . Black wants to put forward a completely new point altogether - Like the Good , even the Bad is just a symbol ......it's just a projection of evil or negative .....the characters don't matter - And I am reasonably sure that , this aspect of his will draw a certain amount of flak.But if one truly understands his point then One will welcome this 'one' with Wide Open Arms.

","On the plus side, director Shane Black essentially does with ""Iron Man 3"" what Sam Mendes did for the Bond franchise with ""Skyfall"". He put it back on track (at least creatively anyway). It's not like ""Iron Man 2"" was a bad superhero movie (especially next to ""Captain America: The First Avenger"") but coming off of the initial blockbuster that was ""Iron Man"", director John Favreau had much to live up to. Thus, for a lot of people ""Iron Man 2"" was a minor disappointment, of which Black has been sent in to correct. Now, does Black accomplish something profound here? Something Favreau wasn't able to do with the previous Iron Man's? Well, the answer is no, not really. Though the material is funnier, much of the visuals are explosion-centric and there is a startling amount of Gwyenth Paltrow abs, the direction isn't as different as many are claiming (which is a good thing). In the end, ""Iron Man 3"" is more of Robert Downey Jr.'s charismatic sensibility, and that's basically all that matters when talking about this franchise.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

","I've heard a lot of mixed reviews about Iron Man 3 so I was a little concerned going into the theater. However, in my opinion the movie was outstanding. The cast and characters were fantastic just like the first two and the plot developed well and, unlike the first two, didn't have so many plot holes. The villain was thankfully not a robot and had some depth as well, which was one of the biggest things Iron Man 2 lacked. There was also plenty of humor, actually, there was more humor than the first two combined and almost all of it felt well timed and fit into the flow of the film. There were a few jokes or quips that felt forced but for the most part there were a lot of laughs to go around. The only real area of weakness for the movie were the overpowered villains. *SPOILER* The villains were so OP it made watching certain battle sequences a little ridiculous. It shouldn't take several Mark suits to take out one of the villains henchmen. And like in the second film, their powers have a limited range (whip in part 2, the need to touch you in this one) so them being capable of going toe-to-toe, let alone overtake a Mark suit was kind of a joke. Nonetheless, the movie was fantastic and these weaker elements, while they sound like a big deal here, are really easy to look past.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013
563,13 August 2014,TheLittleSongbird,7," A solid second sequel if not as good as the first
","The first film was great and among the better Marvel films and the second while a step-down did for all the major problems it had did a lot of things right. As unpopular an opinion as this might be, Iron Man 3 was a solid second sequel and a notch better than the second. Yes it is agreed personally that the Mandarin was not very well handled, he could have been better developed and was cheapened by the face-palm inducing plot twist. Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrow are given very little to do to the extent that Cheadle actually is wasted. And Hans Zimmer's score was a disappointment, I like Zimmer but the score was too much of an over-loud drone that was often too in-your-face and there were numerous times when the orchestration didn't fit. Iron Man 3 still does a lot right, it's very expertly made with the best special effects quality of the three films, striking locations and use of gadgets and very stylish cinematography and editing, never showing any signs of drabness, garishness or choppiness. The action sequences have plenty of great spectacle and are very exciting, especially the plane sequence and the explosive climax, that is by far the best climax of the three(the first's was rushed and overblown to me and the second's while an improvement was rather brief and could have started earlier than it did). The script had plenty of breezy black humour, great exuberance and enough surprises that are done smartly and cleverly. You may miss the mix of comic nostalgia and currant relevance that the direction in the previous two films had but the darker, without being overly-serious approach served the grittier-than-usual story here well and Shane Black does show that he is comfortable in action and in the drama and thriller aspects. The story is more involving and far less familiar than that of the second's, the only reservation being the plot-twist for the Mandarin, and doesn't feel cluttered this time round, and emotional impact, tension, fun and coherence are not sacrificed at least. Robert Downey Jnr. mixes brooding intensity and deadpan comic timing adeptly(if not as fresh and powerhouse quality as in the first) and for the villains Ben Kingsley actually plays deceptive quite brilliantly and Guy Pearce is also very effective. The supporting cast are very good on the whole, though the way they're written varies. All in all, not as good as the first Iron Man but a solid second sequel that is not wholly deserving of the dislike/indifference it gets, though the criticisms are valid. 7/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

It did not follow the tone or the aspect of its predecessors and they wanted to make it more funny than it should have been. I did not like the villains, I felt them to be like too overpowered and their characteristics were like too much to swallow, but not enough chew. It was like you're all ""there, you have powers"" and I'm like ""Why?"" and you go ""Because!! now get to it!!!"" And the thing with the Mandarin it was just a big NO for me. It was nothing like what they offered me in the trailers. It's like when you go to the circus and the announcer tells you about this wild jungle cat and when you enter it's just a kitten with a wig. There was a kid in there and they wanted to make him all witty and funny and cute, but I personally hated him. I thought it was a completely unnecessary character. And another thing is that they were making funny comments when their lives were at stake or before a very intense near-death experience. I just didn't like that they wanted to be funny at inopportune moments of the story. I gave it a 5 out of 10 because it was a big disappointment, although it had very good action sequences.

615,24 May 2013,Robert_duder,8," The Summer Blockbusters begin...here's the lowdown
","Before I go into the nitty gritty of Iron Man 3 let me just try and quell the angry fans that will jump all over me and say that it was a good movie!! It is a well deserving summer Blockbuster with brilliant special effects, a decent story, and a worthy sequel to not only the Iron Man franchise but also the Avengers as well. I enjoyed watching it. However...the big but...I completely understand where some of the fans who are ravaging it with bad reviews are coming from. I believe the incredible, first rate special effects, and the excellent performances warrant at least an 8 but the film has some major flaws too. First of all, this has now become less Iron Man and more The Robert Downey Jr. show. It has always struggled with that balance because Downey is so charismatic and a brilliant actor and to shove him in a metal suit and hide him seems pointless but...that is Iron Man. However, unfortunately the film has evolved into Iron Man suits that control themselves, Downey's Stark that is more James Bond out of the suit, a lot of gun fights like a spy flick and missed opportunities as a superhero movie. It felt like the whole schtick with the Iron Man suit was that none of his suits worked. If this were a drinking game you'd take a shot every time a suit malfunctions and you'd be drunk before the movie was over. He easily spends more time out of the suit than in it. I knew when I saw the trailer with the ""back-up"" of a bunch of different ""Iron Man"" robots that I wouldn't like that angle and I didn't. It was silly and pointless. Do I want to watch a dozen Batmans, Supermans, Iron Mans, Superhero clones? Nope. I came to see one! The other big flaw was that of The Mandarin. I will not give away the twist here because it is a substantial twist but the one thing I was perhaps most excited for from the trailers was the performance of Sir Ben Kingsley as The Mandarin. He appeared larger than life, viscous, an incredible superhero villain...well to say he was underwhelming is the understatement of the year.

It has some great Tony Stark dialogue and the best Iron Man action by far. Secondly, I would classify this as a Tony Stark movie as we see Tony Stark in action as a flawed desperate man much more than we see Iron Man. This is a different vehicle than we've seen before with the Iron Man trilogy. Shane Black takes this film in a different direction that Jon Favreau has in the past, and it is a welcome, albeit different direction.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

638,29 April 2013,haosstoposto,9," Finally - a real Iron Man
","I must say I went reluctantly to see this movie. The first two parts were in my opinion nothing special but for the sake of completism I did see Iron Man 3 and I am very glad that I did. It is a spectacular movie with a superb, almost epic music, composed by Brian Tyler. This time we have a very different Tony Stark then in the first two parts. In the past he was all show, a playboy who wants to attract attention. Now we see him suffer from anxiety attacks and fear after the trauma he experienced in the movie The Avengers"". He lives alone with his girlfriend Pepper in his mansion and he has become a quieter personality, obsessed with his power-suits which give him sense of security. The problem with the first two parts was lack of suspense. We knew that his suits will protect him from harm, and to be honest his enemies were not stronger than he. Now we have an interesting enemy for him, an illusive terrorist named the Mandarin who wants to punish USA and at the same time educate"" US president. He is a mixture between Bin Laden and Fu Manchu. He represents a blending of all western prejudices and fears regarding the eastern civilizations from the middle to the far east. He is a shadowy figure, surrounded by his fanatical followers, philosophical, honourless and extremely cruel. In this movie we also have a contemporary aspect concerning the war on terror and the connection between the US politicians and the oil industry. But not everything is as it seems, and that would be a major spoiler which I will not mention here. There are some other villains with superpowers which are very dangerous indeed. This time Tony Stark does not have much of his hi-tech gadgets at his disposal, only a single malfunctioning power-suit, which is a very good thing story-wise because it creates suspense. Everything is more difficult for him this time and finally we see him in action using his brains instead of power-suits. With this limitations, we see Tony Stark make a transition from superhero to hero, something the audience can relate to more easily. All in all, this is excellent action movie, with clever story, interesting twists and explosive ending. Highly recommended.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

The entire cast, the crew, the FX people and writers should all be as proud of this exceptional movie as they were of the first film. The entire journey and entire film is amazing but it's worth mentioning that they build on what worked in The Avengers. Tony's outward displays of bravado and wit have always hidden a deeply troubled and complex character. His demons are always under the surface. They make sure to recall the events of Avengers where this mortal hero faced impossible odds and even death in the darkest of deep space. That would rattle any person and I'm so glad they didn't gloss that over. It adds depth never before seen in these type of films. Tony was deeply affected and is deeply troubled. Now, add a twisted and truly formidable villain presence in Kingley's Mandarin and what they delivered was a movie as good as it gets.

The movie fails in every possible way, the only scene we actually get a bit nervous is when the Mandarin attacks Tony's house, but we have seen this scene in every trailer of the movie. Of course Robert Downey Jr. delivers a perfect job, so does Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Kingsley. Unfortunately for those last two the script just fails. A lot of people are having problem with the Mandarin and having it as the major complain about the movie. Of course I have a problem with that too, but this is not why I hated this movie, although it helped a bit.

","Badly in need of a spark after an underwhelming second installment, this series has swapped directors and imported a major villain from the comics for its third. Frankly, it doesn't fare any better for the effort. That's partially due to the Tony Stark character hitting a wall - his arc has been stagnant for a while now - but I found more culpability in the icy set of cold feet developed around the plot's halfway point. In the blink of an eye, the whole tone of the picture changes from a topical dash of political intrigue (and a pointed metaphor for the US's approach to terrorism) to just another struggle between Stark and the latest in a long line of bland, suit-wearing, self-enhanced business rivals with an eye on one of his inventions. That the Mandarin is downplayed doesn't necessarily bother me. Actually, I found Ben Kingsley wonderful in the role and enjoyed the sudden wheel-jerk of his change in course (those upset about his blasphemous take on a sacred character need look no further than the short follow-up film All Hail the King for vindication). But that sudden, accompanying leap from a new path to a tired, over-familiar formula is a development sour enough to curl toes. This character needed a blast of fresh air, some momentum to carry him through the next phase of Marvel's plans. Instead, he's simply planted his feet deeper in the same vat of quicksand.

","I have to repeat the title because it's the sad truth... are the heroic movies resorting to comedy to lengthen its entirety in hopes of keeping the story ""interesting?"" Where are the serious action films? This film was less than entertaining from the music choice in the beginning to the way the criminals lacked conviction to do anything actually menacing. So let me start with the pathetic criminal ""mastermind"" in this movie... Guy Pearce can only do so much to the point where his performance is actually nauseating. I couldn't even believe this movie was being serious with the idea of creating a man who fueled himself revenge due to the fact the world's most sought after billionaire didn't meet him on the roof to discuss an important matter, this is complete and utter childishness. He couldn't schedule to meet with Mr. Stark later on. Once again, the convenience of the film's sieging of an opportunity towards elaborating on a plot that died the moment they involved revenge was utterly pathetic, and the fact that this movie made 1.2 billion dollars makes me question whether people care anymore towards whether or not their money goes towards something beautiful; which this movie was far from. I couldn't stand any of the characters in this movie because the script was non-engaging, almost every five minutes there was a giggle joke intervening the concept of the story so by the time the movie was over it comes off more as a comedy more than an a film to be taken as a serious installment towards the Avengers II. Which is why the first Iron Man, will always be the best out of the franchise no matter how many more films there are in the coming years involving Tony Stark.

What does come of as a surprise is that if you are aware of comic books, you would be knowing the looks of Mandarin, which might come out a little indigestible. Having said that it does not take away the credit that should be given to Shane Black for his effort. He has pulled off a great plot and would make you fall in love with RDJ all over again.

I know he is going to be in Avengers 2 but I figured they could start moving forward on Iron Man 4 too. Anyone know why they haven't?

","In the third instalment from the Iron Man films Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) finds his world torn apart and demons from his past come back to haunt him. In a time before the Iron Man tech Tony's ego forces him to stand-up some advancing, if not amateur, scientists who are making advances in their own fields, Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) and Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall). Who would have thought that in years to come they would end up working together to try and bring Stark and the world to it's knees. Of course Tony doesn't know this until the later parts of the film, initially his attention is on bringing down the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), a terrorist leader who is hell bent on destruction and revenge. Working with the Iron Patriot (the painted re-branded War machine) (Don Cheadle) he attempts to bring the Mandarin down and serve justice. While all this is going on Tony is fighting new demons and anxieties which are a result of the incidents of the Avengers movie, it seems going through a worm hole in space has left him changed slightly. Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is now running Stark industries and a reformed Killian (when he tried meeting Stark in the flashback at the start of the film, he was suffering a disability) meets with her to try and get Stark Industry backing for his Advanced Idea Mechanics (AIM) project ""Extremis"" which harnesses the brains power to alter DNA. Meanwhile Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) is seriously injured in a blast, its up to Tony to investigate this, which is a good idea as the investigation will help to uncover Killian's plot and also who the Mandarin really is and what his intentions are.

","When I was getting ready to go and see this film I looked it up and discovered that it was two plus hours long. I groaned, and hoped that there would not be a lot of fluff. To my pleasant surprise there was not. It was the first time in a long time, that I could not feel the time go by. There were a couple of surprises that I did not see coming, which made the film even more entertaining. I also liked the fact that the film made reference to what happened to the Avengers back in New York. It gives all the Marvel characters a sense of connectivity. I even saw the same connectivity in the Trailer for the next Thor, where Loki is locked up for what he had done. Robert Downey Jr. (Tony Stark/Iron Man) is true to form and brings with him his usual wit and humor. Ben Kingsley (The Mandarin) was brilliant as usual, but I had no idea that his range was so expansive and that he could play this type of role. I think that a lot of folks will be surprised. Guy Pearce (Aldrich Killian) who is the mad scientist of the bunch, is one of the more creative villains ever created. The ""tug-at-your-heartstrings"" role went to Ty Simpkin (Harley Keener), who is quickly befriended by Tony as a mini partner in stopping the bad guys. Although Gwyneth Paltrow (Pepper Potts) did not have a lot of screen time, her character made a definite impact on the outcome. Don Cheadle (James Rhodes) reprises his character very well, although he gets a bit of a make-over that is kind of cheesy. Director Shane Black has really made a name for himself behind the camera instead of in front of one. I have to say that I liked this Iron Man better than the previous films. I think it was because this film focused more on the man instead of the superhero. We get a chance to see Tony as a little vulnerable and that he has issues just like the rest of us. I did not see this film in 3D, but I could see where some of the action scenes would have been more explosive in that format.

I honestly feel that any money that this movie makes will be because of the movies before it.. and not because of its own merits..

I actually kinda regret paying to see it in theatre.. I should have just waited for pay per view or something.. It was no where in the same realm or class of the other movies I named here.. the story line was weak, the characters had no passion or chemistry.. tony stark seemed like an empty shell.. we have seen that character face his mortality several times yet never once did it shake him. And where was shield when all this was going on.. the whole thing just made no sense.. all of this I might have been willing to accept if they had at least gotten The Mandarin right but they dropped the ball on that too.. in the comics The Mandarin is portrayed as a genius scientist and a skilled martial artist. However, his primary sources of power are ten power rings that he adapted from the alien technology of a crashed space ship. Each ring has a different power and is worn on a specific finger. Not one part of this was portrayed in the movie.. instead they made The Mandarin just another genetically enhanced moron with delusions of grandeur, all in all this is the is definitely one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.

","Wanted to give this 6/10, but couldn't. So much of this felt inconsequential in that I know all these characters are in the other movies, so I have no reason to be worried if they'll live or die. A lot of this felt like it was throwing everything at me in the hopes that I'll be entertained. There were so many explosions and spectacle, way too much to be beneficial to the narrative. So much of the character conflict relies on callback to The Avengers movie as well- it's called Iron Man 3, not Avengers 2. Additionally, Downey Jr. gave a pretty shallow performance of an anxiety attack, it felt really out of touch.
I will say that the end fight was impressive, but it was still difficult to suspend my disbelief entirely - Tony's falling and getting beat up so much but he doesn't seem very bruised at all.
The post credits scene was nonsensical- you're telling me that a super rich genius wouldn't hire an actual certified therapist to talk through his anxiety? Really?

784,2 August 2022,TheHonestCritic,6," A worthy conclusion to the ""Iron Man"" trilogy? Or, is it just a pile of garbage? Check out my review below!
","""Iron Man 3"" (2013), also stylized as ""Iron Man Three"" (which is stupid, but we'll talk about that later). For those who may not know, I'm a huge fan of the first two ""Iron Man"" films. The first two movies in this trilogy, in my opinion are two of the best in the Marvel Cinematic Universe! So, you can imagine my excitement when I heard the first announcement for ""Iron Man 3"", right? I was counting down the days leading up to it's release, my hype for it was overwhelming. Unfortunately, it just ended up being an underwhelming letdown at the end of the day. ""Iron Man 3"" has a boring and inconsistent story, and the acting was embarrassing overall. The plot is, Tony Stark is suffering from PTSD following the final battle in ""The Avengers"" (2012). To make matters worse, his whole world winds up being torn apart by an extremist, known as the Mandarin. He eventually goes on his own odyssey to rebuild his life and seek retribution. When I first read the spoiler-free synopsis, I thought: ""all right, this sounds like it could be interesting. If they can just execute it properly, then we'll have ourselves a winner!"" Sadly, very little to no potential is utilized and we're dealt with boring and inconsistent results. One of the biggest problems here, is the changing of directors. Right there, I knew that this film was in trouble. The first two ""Iron Man"" movies were directed by Jon Favreau, who also plays Happy Hogan in these three films respectfully. For ""Iron Man 3"", Shane Black takes over as director. Once I saw that it was going to be someone different directing, that really concerned me right away. The director of a movie makes all the difference, and nowhere is that any more obvious than here. Granted, there have been other films in different franchises where different people direct throughout the lineup of movies. A perfect example is the ""Mission Impossible"" franchise, the first five films each had a different director, which really helped each individual movie stand out and be distinct. I was hoping that would be the case for ""Iron Man 3"", but no. When I saw it, I felt like I was watching something else. Seriously, it hardly felt anything like an ""Iron Man"" film. The pacing for it is inconsistent, and it drags on for way too long. That being said, there are some good elements in the story. Such as: Tony dealing with PTSD, and a few of the action sequences were okay. Other than that, it's just nothing special to me. One of the biggest insults was easily the twist about the main villain. I actually knew of the Mandarin from the comics before I went to see this movie. So, I was very excited to see how he would be portrayed! Unfortunately, we end up with cringe-worthy results. On a final note regarding the plot, I feel I must bring up the end titles. Usually, I don't critique opening or end credits. However, this one is a rare case. After ""The Avengers"", most Marvel movies showed the title at the end, like the DC films, which is lazy. But, that's not the worst part. When the title is shown, it's written as ""Iron Man Three"". No, really, that's how they wrote it. Why? That's just stupid! It's like the editors were ashamed of this movie. Wow, you know it's bad if the editors hate it! Right? It's like they were trolling it on purpose. Film Making 101: when you do sequel titles, end it with a number, not a word. ""Iron Man Three""? Are you kidding me? I'm sorry to keep dwelling on that, but it just really perplexes me. Any way, why don't we move on. Shall we? As for the acting, it's just an embarrassment. The only ones who seem to be trying with what they had to work with, are: Robert Downey Jr, Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle. Everyone else is standard to just plain horrible with their performances! Probably the most annoying acting comes from Guy Pearce. He's just so obnoxious to watch here! The acting is a terrible letdown, what a huge disappointment. Now, let's get to the positive elements in this trash heap. The sets/locations are interesting and give the film a unique atmosphere. All of the special effects are very well-done. Which is no surprise, being that this movie came out in 2013! Finally, the soundtrack composed by Brian Tyler is excellent. His film score sets a great tone for the storyline. Although, sometimes I think the music is trying harder than the plot! ""Iron Man 3"" is nothing short of an embarrassment to the Marvel movies. All of the films in the saga leading up to this one have been good, so this one, for me, was the first real dud in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Is it the worst superhero movie I've ever seen? Absolutely not, there are a lot of worse ones out there. I give this film a 3 out of 5 star rating, which equates to 6 out of 10 stars. A 3 out of 5 star rating is dividing mark where I differentiate a movie being good or bad. ""Iron Man 3"" is a very marginal 3 out of 5/6 out of 10 and I consider it, by my standards, to be a bad movie. Do I really have to tell you to stay away from this film? But seriously, if you skip this movie, you'll be doing yourself a favor. Just stick with the first two ""Iron Man"" films instead!",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

There are so many reasons why this movie should have been great and so many reasons why it wasn't, this truly is one of the most disappointing films I have ever seen.

788,18 June 2013,dearbornvendetta,7," Okay movie with an excellent cast
","This is a movie that falls under the category for me as needing 2 views to fully appreciate it. If your a devoted Iron Man fan familiar with the comics and the many cartoons he's been in you are likely to want to walk out halfway through. If your only experience with Iron man is the current Marvel movies you'll love it. The movie has excellent action, excellent special effects and Robert Downey jr is at the top of his game with his best performance yet. The advertising of this film is its main fault. The trailers promised a more serious movie and the arrival of the long anticipated nemesis of Iron Man, the Mandarin. Without giving much away it fails to meet both those things which is why I have to dock a star for the deception and for the lack of interest in pleasing the hardcore fans who after all is why these characters got popular enough to bring to the big screen. That being said this movie is a lot of fun and better than the second although still cant top the charm and perfect balance of humor and action the first movie had. There is a lot of fun to be had and aside from some small plot holes and one shockingly odd twist its one of the better marvel movies to date. Im not your movie goer whose is woed into loving a movie due to its action content or special effects as many people are, i look for character development and good story and this movie has all of that and some great action as well. I will say I felt Iron Patriot ( formerly War Machine) was yet again not given his due which is a bummer since this is the last solo Iron Man movie. Hopefully he turns up in the Avengers 2 and is given the role he deserves.

Who shows more humanity with all its frailness, as he faces his greatest adversary. It's not exactly the Mandarin we're familiar with from the Marvel comic, but Iron Man himself is not exactly the comic book Iron Man, so it makes sense. But it all works, as I said because the well written character is met with a tour de force of acting by a certain Robert Downey Jr.who's simply superb. It's one of the best performances I've seen from an actor in a long while. And it makes this super hero movie just this extra little bit better than most. It makes it real, even if you're not a fun of the genre, which I have to admit, I am. I think this one will move even some comic skeptics, if they give it a try.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

820,18 June 2013,alex_j-573-361716,6," This movie caught me off guard. And not in a good way.
","I'm going to go straight into it. The film explores the concept of ""it's the man not the machine"" so basically this is more of a Tony Stark film and less an iron man film. Which is a good thing we get to see that Tony start really is his own greatest weapon, or at least it's his intellect, his ability to create things from scratch and think quick out of grim situation. Yes there is of course some good iron man action but the depth of this movie revolves around Tony, he is now dealing with PTSD(post traumatic stress disorder) so that is affecting his relationship with pepper and what not. So the film did have some strong elements, but here come the bad ones, the comedy relief took away from the tone that the movie was trying to set up and i had a really hard time taking the movie seriously which annoyed me, I would have liked to have seen another iron man and war machine team up but the result of them being together felt abit more like some buddy cop film, and thats nothing against buddy cop films i love rush hour, lethal weapon etc, but the tone felt way off. Let me talk about the twist now, i probably should do a separate review just based on the twist but i'll just spit it out here and now. First off i didn't like it at all for several reasons, if i go into all the details this review will become too long for anyone to want to read. I will just say I am a comic fan and have waited a long time for the mandarin to be brought to the big screen ever since his reference in the first Iron man film. I also felt disappointed to know all the hype during the marketing and trailers turned out to be pretty much a lie. I felt the character portrayal by Ben Kingsley was working just fine and would have loved to see how the movie would play out if he was the actual central villain and not some fictional persona created by Guy Pearce's character. I didn't mind that he didn't have 10 power rings and all that i understand changes and reinterpretations need to be made for the sake of incorporating this character to a more realistic cinematic universe. But i found what they did went waaaay beyond that and it was unnecessary. Guy Pearce to me was not the mandarin, he had nothing in common with the character in the comics and i felt the director was like"" well...lets not the leave the film completely mandarinless"" so they had Guy pearce shout out "" I AM the mandarin"" near the end which to me was if anything metaphoric and only technical. Yea the twist was unexpected but so was the twist in the film"" The Village"" just because a twist surprises you doesn't always mean it should be done. In this case it may have worked but in my opinion they simply didn't do it right and that ruined the film for me. Also his armors breaking all the time got repetitive and annoying at times, it took away from the significance of the other two films and also diminishes that sense of uniqueness, after all he is supposed to be the INVINCIBLE iron man. I get they wanted to show Tony stark as being more vulnerable, but they already did when exploring his other issues as mentioned before in my review. All in all i guess it was alright but in a fans perspective i would give this movie a much lower rating and I feel this movie more or less disregards the fans, and as a fan no matter how hard i try to like this movie it's just so damn difficult.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

","'Iron Man 3' is a classic example of what happens when you attempt to make lightning strike in the same place thrice: it doesn't quite work. There have been few casting decisions in the last 20 years of cinema as perfect as the pick of Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark (a.k.a Iron Man). Iron Man 3 reminds us of this miracle every time RDJ is on-screen; the billion-dollar franchise depends on him and his great skill at playing this witty, ingenuous billionaire-turned-superhero. The original 'Iron Man' film benefited from a great script that chronicled Tony Stark's transformation into his Iron Man persona. That first film was a smash hit for those 2 reasons: Great script and great lead actor. Now we must subtract the great script for both 'Iron Man 2' and 'Iron Man 3' which leaves only the great actor as a character that we really enjoy. These are mediocre stories compared with the first film, however they are enjoyable due to the action and RDJ's performances. The anticipation for this movie was also amped way up after the incredible 'Avengers' movie, which also benefited from both Downey and an amazing script. That brings us to 'Iron Man 3' which has 'Corporate Meddling' written all over it. I'm not sure exactly why, but highly anticipated blockbusters always tend to be overworked, predictable and drenched in overdone, expensive CGI effects ( Think: Spiderman 3) . Iron Man 3 is such a film with a confused script and a lot of odd ideas for location shooting. By now, Tony Stark has developed his armor in striking ways and with amazing capabilities, so much so that we have little to look forward to in a 4th movie with so many great ideas for the armor crammed into this installment. RDJ keeps us glued to Tony Stark as he carries out an investigation into the terrorist bombings of the Osama Bin Laden-ish villain 'The Mandarin'. The always great Ben Kingsley has a great time with this character and creates a few laughs along the way. Another fine actor, Guy Pierce ( Memento, The Count of Monte Cristo) is completely wasted in his two-dimensional role as mad scientist Aldrich Killian. Many of the sacrifices made by the other actors are simply to make room for Robert Downey Jr. himself. Tony Stark needs a lot of screen time, but the crammed and forced script and plot twists need a lot of screen time also! Mix it all together and it will certainly not match nor suitably follow 'The Avengers' or the original 'Iron Man'.

There were major changes in The Avengers film and Captain America and Thor. Yet those changes only served to make the film better. The story this time around is After the events of The Avengers Tony Stark is falling apart. He can't sleep and suffers panic attacks. The Events of the battle of New York and his trip into the alien dimension and the fact that he died. All of these things weigh heavily on him. Tony spends his time making more Iron Man Armor.

Happy is paranoid of every new face, When Aldrich Killian meets with Pepper to show off his company's new break through a virus he calls Extremis.

One of the ways Extremis works is it can take the body's healing process and magnify it by a hundred times making the body heal itself at a rapid pace. More then that there are other ways Extermis can make itself useful. The film after the introduction of Extremis and Killian goes into overdrive It has twists and turns and spectacular stunts.

","Starting with the Avengers, Marvel has distastefully aimed their movies at the minds of children under the age of 12. This movie is absolutely, not an exception. Filled with a poorly constructed plot and jokes which took too much effort to make work, the clear focus of this film is the cliché of childish action flick: some good action and lots of explosions. Overall, quite disappointing as the first two iron man movies were quite enjoyable in my book. I don't know if Disney's involvement or Shane Black's directing is to blame and I don't care.

869,27 June 2013,monkriffe,9," The Fall and rise of House Stark
","At the time of first writing, Robert Downey Junior had finished his contract with Marvel Studios, and as yet there had been no announcements that he, or Iron Man will be coming back, beyond a tantalising ""Tony Stark will Return"" during the credits. Thus the news that he is coming back for two more movies is a relief, to say the least. RDJ has over the last 5 years strikingly embodied a character fans have been hoping for since the 60s, and made him cool, as well as kicking off Marvel's groundbreaking vision of a cinematic universe that other studios are now rushing to try and follow. Without him, there would not only be no Iron man, but there might not have been an Avengers, either. That said, Iron Man 3 ceases to be simply another superhero movie, and becomes a possible swansong for a cult hero of fans everywhere. Does it live up to the challenge? Hell yes. This is not Tony Stark's finest hour. What it is, though, is his best film to date. As Tony says himself, this is a film about demons, specifically those you create. We open in 1999, pre Tony's weekend away in an Afghan cave and adding a sense of continuity to the trilogy. Tony's casual snubbing of a nerdy geneticist who later becomes a villain is one of the film's few predictable plot points, and Guy Pearce's performance as Aldrich Killian manages to sell the moment. More on him in a moment. Back to Tony. We also meet the bright and innocent Scientist Maya Hansen, played by Rebecca Hall, inventor of a bio virus named Extremis, capable of rewriting human DNA, converting humans into sizzling skin-crawling lava lamps, regenerating limbs, and, um going boom. Snap forward 13 years, and Tony has locked himself in his basement, making a prehensile suit that attaches itself, piece by piece to his body, sometimes with considerable force. His only companions are robots, the social creature seen only 10 minutes previously hiding considerable PTSD with bravado and obsessively creating countless variations on the iron man suit. This self imposed exile is not without consequence. The Big Bad quickly shows himself as the Mandarin, a drawling Ben Kingsley offering anti-Western ""lessons"", usually ending with a claim of responsibility for something going boom without a locatable bomb device. After a casual approach leaves one of his friends in a coma and an overly arrogant invitation to his house leaves said house destroyed in an admittedly spectacular action sequence, Stark starts taking the Mandarin seriously, and the rest of the Movie takes off from there. The attack on the Stark Mansion is where we start taking the movie in general seriously as well. The reappearance of Maya coincides with a helicopter attack complete with missiles, explosions, and not one but two of the Stark Family suiting up thanks to the flying Mark 42 suit. Pepper suiting up is one of the many fan services done in this movie, and it is gratefully received. Following this adrenalin fuelled boom- fest, Stark finds himself alone, homeless, and really wishing he'd plugged the Mark 42 in to charge before going out. What follows then is where the movie begins to shine- Stark suit less, alone and working to track down the people behind the Mandarin and take them out for good. Without an Iron Suit Stark resorts to hand made weapons, exploding baubles and the help of a small kid named Hayley, cleverly sidestepping the superhero sidekick cliché with snappy dialogue, and being downright rude, whilst never becoming unlikeable as a character. Quite a feat. From there the plot develops as organically as possible, with so many plot twists that revealing here would spoil the story for anyone who hasn't seen it yet. The fact is, this a story about Tony Stark- not Iron Man, showing that as much as the suits are cool ( and they are- look out for the Mark 42), it's the man inside them, who really has our hearts and this film finally manages to balance some stunning action sequences with some real character development, Dark Knight rises style. Verdict: See it already! While not perfect, and not everyone may agree with Sir Ben Kingsley's portrayal of the Mandarin, this is definitely Stark's best outing yet, and if it had turned out to be the Golden avengers swansong, then he certainly would have gone out with a bang.

By injuring him mortally through a heart wound and making him vulnerable and then leading him to essentially don a suit of armor like a chivilaristic knight, Stan Lee was able to create a sympathetic character out of an unsympathetic situation.

889,28 November 2019,kelboy10,7," Any old iron
","Iron man is back and has moments of greatness and elements of surprise but did it all work swimmingly. Well in my opinion it rusted ever so slightly. The main problem with this film is the villain for me. The motive is good but the execution not so much. Jealously can be a dangerous thing and arrogance can set it off. But for me the previous instalments had stronger character development for our main antagonist. Maybe the twist gave the main villain much less screen time than we were prepared to accept. The main villain is a terrorist in the name of the Manderin or so we are lead to believe. But not everything is what it seems. Tony Stark does some crazy stuff for an intelligent man and is easily sent over the edge when his friend Happy is injured. Although there isn't a great deal of character development on their friendship. One big flaw for me is the simplicity in which the manderin is offered Mr Starks home address on the entire news. Now we know from previous instalments Tony can be his own worst enemy, at times egotistical, but seriously this is ridiculous. Does Tony not consider the danger he is not only putting himself in but his girlfriend Pepper. Being the third instalment like most third parts the exaggeration and humour has stepped it up a few levels and of course so has the explosions. Robert Downey Jr maintains his believable flirtatious chemistry with Gwyneth Paltrows Pepper but also begins ascending new friendships in the unlikely nerdy boy in basement type or garage to be accurate. More of a distraction or annoyance than a friend but a healthy one to remove him from his PTSD after the events of the Avengers alien invasion. Downey Jr shows great emotional depth and along with humour/witty intellect he brings stress and anxiety to a much more round less invincible Tony. He proves that he is much more than just iron man. At times a mentor/father figure to the boy that he treats only like an adult. Juxtaposed along with how his father may well have treated him judging from flashes we have seen of Howard Stark throughout the marvel cinematic universe. Pepper is no longer the damsel in distress in this one but a influential team player and a worthy ally and partner for Stark. Guy Pearce is good in his role as the envious Aldrich Killian but we don't seem to get enough of him as we'd like. Overall it's a solid sequel but nothing groundbreaking in the comic book movie world.

896,23 September 2013,JPfanatic93,6," Marvel's Phase 2 can only get better from here on out
","Most disappointing of the Marvel Studios movies so far. Shane Black (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) took over the director's chair from Jon Favreau who did the first two installments. Maybe it's Black's tendency to go over the top a bit too far, maybe the writers and producers just got terribly lazy in the creative process after the success of the predecessors, but Iron Man 3 proves a dud. Tony Stark finally has found a decent equilibrium between his eccentric playboy life and his public role as the armored superhero Iron Man, but soon his world is turned upside down after he deliberately picks a fight with the vicious terrorist leader Mandarin (""played by Sir Ben Kingsley"") who wounded his former bodyguard Happy (still performed by Favreau himself at least). The Mandarin comes down hard on Tony, destroying his mansion and seemingly obliterating his various armors. With only his wit, his engineering skills, his insufferable character flaws – he was never more irritating than he is here – and the aid of some kid in a shack, he soon turns the tables and confronts his new nemesis and his silly army of exploding people, only to find out the situation is not what it appeared to be, as the Mandarin is just a fraud (way to ruin a classic bad guy, Marvel!). Another adversary, A.I.M. leader Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) is behind it all, out to revenge himself on Stark, literally for making him cry ten years earlier (now that's what I call a solid motivation for aiming to conquer the world!). During the film's climactic showdown, Tony can fortunately count on his girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) to save his ass, plus he had another 40 armors inexplicably hidden up his sleeve. Iron Man 3 pretentiously delves into semi-philosophical territory when it keeps asking whether the suit makes the man or vice versa, but the fact is we simply don't care. All we knew was that Robert Downey Jr. made Iron Man and now sloppy writing has allowed him to be unmade, for which Downey reportedly received the sum of 50 million (!) dollars, probably for looking the other way as it happened. At least Stark is basically still the same after four films, as it was clear what audiences wanted and expected from the get-go. The same can't be said for the Mandarin, whose presence was alluded to in the previous two Iron Man films, but all of a sudden proves to be someone else entirely halfway through the film. Don't trust the trailers for this film that insinuated that we were in for a major epic villain played by Kingsley, since that's all a lie and you'll end up disappointed. Blame it on the Chinese involvement, as Iron Man 3 was co-produced with Chinese studios to cut costs (Downey's salary had to come from somewhere after all). And in such a case, you simply can't afford to have a Chinese villain claiming to be after the destruction of western civilization. Interestingly enough, the Chinese market received a slightly different cut of the film including scenes not seen in the regular version, to make it even more attractive for Chinese audiences. Iron Man 3 bodes ill for the rest of Marvel's Phase 2, but there's gotta be better upcoming movies to make up for this huge letdown. Ant-Man maybe?",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

910,25 April 2013,PassPopcorn,7," Pass the Popcorn review
","In superhero movie franchises there is the famous rule that the second movie is, usually, the best one with the third being the worst. Ever since the flawed Iron Man 2 came out, it was pretty obvious the Iron Man franchise wouldn't follow this rule. After that set back, on the other hand, it was rather unclear what to expect from the third one. Will it be, nevertheless, the worst one? Or will it completely negate the superhero franchises' rule and triumph as the best one? The answer to these questions is: Iron Man 3 is neither the best nor the worst Iron Man movie. However, it is the strangest. You may ask, what do I mean by strange. Well, first of all, unbelievable as it may sound, Iron Man 3 is not a superhero movie. Of course, there are some superhero movie elements here and there, but in its core Iron Man 3 is an action/comedy/thriller. To put in the words of director/co-writer Shane Black (who replaced Jon Favreau in the director's chair) - it's kind of a Tom Clancy style thriller. Because of that, Iron Man 3 is much more similar to another Robert Downey Jr. movie - also directed by Shane Black - 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'. While I applaud the idea of experimenting with different genres, the ending result was not satisfying.

935,25 March 2019,margulanabutrlov,9," Iron Man 3 Review
","Christmas, 2012. Following the Avengers' planet-saving victory in New York, Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) has returned to his life of ease in Malibu. But a series of panic attacks and escalating threats from a maniac called the Mandarin (Kingsley) threaten to tip him over the edge.
Three signs you're watching a Shane Black movie: it's Christmas, there's a meta voiceover, and some of the best lines are dispensed by designer-suited henchmen. Pleasingly, Iron Man 3 ticks every box. Just as Joss Whedon pepped up Avengers Assemble with his unique brand of jocosity, here, despite the sci-fi trimmings and goliath budget, it feels like Black's been given carte blanche by Marvel to do his thing. The result is a swinging caper with wit, balls, heart and exploding baubles. It's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang with a lot of extra bang. And, by some distance, the Man In The Can's best solo outing so far.
Together with co-writer Drew Pearce, Black sets out to dismantle Iron Man's armour piece by piece. Like Bond in Skyfall, Tony Stark loses his flash car and big house. He is also, for a sizeable stretch of the movie, deprived of his super-suits. This is a new, vulnerable side to the playboy-philanthropist: he's on the run, in the corner, pausing between quips to suffer breathless anxiety attacks.
Part of the problem is PTSD, brought on by his near-fatal tangle with that Chitauri wormhole in New York. But his more pressing concern is a very bad man who goes by the monicker The Mandarin. A shadowy, ethnically indeterminate figure with the didactic menace of Colonel Kurtz and the attack-chopper access of Colonel Kilgore, this terrorist overlord is regularly forcing his way onto US airwaves to threaten dire ""lessons"". No-one knows his identity, his location or where he's buying his extraordinarily nifty video-editing software.
This may all sound like the fixings for another brooding threequel: The Stark Knight Rises. Happily, that's not how it pans out. Keeping the dial firmly on 'fun', the film hustles from one set-piece to the next, leavening the gloom with a lot of big laughs.
As well as the customary Downey Jr wisecracks, there are sight gags, bits of slapstick, Downton Abbey references and a genius beat involving a suit of armour turning its head. The ominous introduction of a boy sidekick in the second act turns out to yield some of the sparkiest repartee. And Don Cheadle's Rhodes, a character who barely made an impression in the other films, is skilfully tweaked, becoming the amusingly square Murtaugh to Tony's Riggs. Wait until you hear his password.
The series' villains have always been an issue. Thor gets Loki. Captain America gets the Red Skull. So far, Iron Man has faced a bald Jeff Bridges, Mickey Rourke and a cockatoo. While this outing is an improvement - credit to Black and Pearce for creating antagonists who aren't just more angry blokes in metal suits - it's still the film's weak point. Drawing on the comic-book's Extremis storyline (a 2005-'06 run by Warren Ellis), Iron Man 3 pits Stark against a squad of T-1000-like super-soldiers who can regenerate body parts and survive astounding damage. They're visually interesting - glowing like human lava lamps as they try to smelt Tony's face off - but their motivation is murky and unconvincing.
Far more successful is the aforementioned Mandarin, who in the Iron Man comics is a super-powered martial artist with magic rings. While a close-up shot reveals that his fingers are adorned by rings, there are surprises beneath the character's sinister hood which we won't spoil. Suffice to say that people will be talking about Ben Kingsley's performance for ages to come - it's a tricky, delicate role, handled beautifully.
Not every performance hits the mark - scanty screentime for Rebecca Hall, as Tony's botanist ex, and Miguel Ferrer, as the Vice-President, suggests the existence of a longer cut. These are minor niggles, though, in a satisfying blockbuster that mixes up political conspiracy, sleuth-work, MacGyver-ish DIY weaponisation and outstanding eye-candy. The Iron Man suits - and there are now 42 of them - are used ingeniously (watch out for Stark giving himself a literal hand in a tight spot), not least in the action highlight, the spectacular 'barrel of monkeys' sequence. This sees Air Force One under assault and its passengers forced to disembark thousands of feet above the Florida coast, not helping what is proving to be a heinous cinematic summer for POTUS.
As for why the other Avengers aren't getting off their invincible butts to help, it's explained away, a little unconvincingly, with the line: ""This isn't superhero business. It's American business."" Iron Man 3's greatest achievement is that they're not missed.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

","Much of the initial and earliest criticism from comic book fans was that Mandarin was just an invention of Killian Archer, and that Ben Kingsley's Trevor Slattery made a joke out of an established Marvel comic book villain. Well, we now know that Killian didn't invent Mandarin, he merely co-opted it for his own purposes. The real Mandarin, the leader of the Ten Rings, was always real. He just didn't appear until years later (2021) in Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. And Ben Kingsley's Trevor Slattery also appeared in that film, firmly bridging the two films. So Shang Chi very effectively retconned Iron Man 3's Mandarin and destroyed that aspect of its early criticism from die hard comic book fans.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

","I really love Iron Man. I hadn't watched a Marvel movie in a while, so had forgotten how good he was until I watched this and I was grinning from ear to ear in a lot of his scenes (and sometimes crying). Tony Stark is so brilliant and witty!
This movie is narrated by Tony Stark, which is interesting and different. The plot is awesome and has some surprising twists and turns. The animation and CGI is top notch as usual and the dialogue is great and the acting is perfect. It plays like a mystery thriller, specifically like a James Rollins novel, which was awesomely disturbing at times. The villains are interesting and not whom you expect. The climax is so, so, so tense and thrilling and very well-played - actually the whole movie is.
I also loved how this focuses solely on Tony Stark and shows him when he's a rock bottom with no-one and nothing, pressed into a corner with nowhere else to go. Downey really did an awesome job of capturing Tony Stark as he battles PTSD.

","Given the intense run-up to this film, I was far too aware of studio machinations behind it. I could almost smell the ink on the contract Downey Jr. signed to the franchise that certainly guaranteed him a minimum amount of face time. It's ludicrous how much time he spends as just plain old Tony Stark, running around with a gun or with self-made gadgets or wearing only part of the Iron Man armor (careful to keep his face exposed). The character seems to have gone far beyond anything the comic envisioned. The movie version of Stark is more complex and that's great. Except, the armor has become no more than a metaphor for the theoretical armor Stark hides behind. They come up with many imaginative ways 42 suits of armor (all built by Stark alone because he can't help it), but in the end they just seem like more excuses to get Downey Jr's face in front of the camera and STILL have scenes with armor so it can be an Iron Man movie.

","Iron Man 3 for the longest time was my favorite MCU movie of all time until Spiderman: No Way Home came out in 2021, but there is no doubt in my mind that this film comes in a close second. After mysterious attacks by a terrorist only known as The Mandarin, Tony Stark must come to face a new enemy unlike anything he's fought before while also discovering a connection to his past, and what it truly means to be a hero even without his suit of armor. For starters, the film is heavily missed by Jon Favreau's unique directing style like the first two Iron Man films had, but Shane Black was able to pull of in my opinion my favorite film in the Iron Man trilogy. It's has action, comedy, heart and is emotional at times that pull at your heart strings that help make the film be the most sentimental and truest of all the Iron Man films. Robert Downey Jr returns once again as Tony Stark/Iron Man after the events of The Avengers (2012) that has a bit of anxiety and paranoia while trying to be one step ahead for the next big threat that's thrown at him or the world. Gwyneth Paltrow returns as Pepper Potts once again and this is probably my favorite performance of her playing Pepper Potts out of all three Iron Man films. Don Cheadle returns as Rhodey and I thought he was great as always. Guy Pearce as Aldrich Killian I thought did a good job as well, but the problem I had with his character was how obvious they made it that he was the true mastermind of the whole plot of the film. I also liked Ben Kingsley's Trevor Slattery/The Mandarin. The only real problem I have with his character was that I felt after knowing his character's true purpose, I thought it was kind of a let down, because of how much I looked forward to him being the villain, but after what it would later set up in the MCU, I'm not really mad about it anymore. Out of all the superhero trilogy's in the MCU, Iron Man 3 was the film that I felt not ended Iron Man's story obviously, but ended the Iron Man saga and it did it in fashion with all of the characters, it's incredible story, and Iron Man suits unlike anything we've imagined.

","Going into this one I was worried it wasn't going to be as good as the first one and i would have hoped for it to be better than iron man 2 as i was very skeptical about it but after watching the 3rd and final movie i felt the same as i did after i watched the second movie and honestly there were some parts which were very cool and parts that I didn't like i won't mention them as I don't want to spoiler the movie but what i can say the start of the movie sets the tone with awesome pieces of cinema and then as it goes along it gets slower but when I think about it I wonder if this movie would ever improve over time but i guess i will give it a little while and then watch it again and then we will see. The cast is Robert Downey Jr as Tony/Iron man post Avengers and we see some PTSD which is new to the character in the movie universe we also have the return of Gwyneth Paltrow,Don Cheadle and Jon Favreau further improving the overall stories and look into these amazing characters. The new comers to this movie is Rebecca Hall as Maya Hansen and Guy Pearce as Aldrich Killian
also Ty Simpkins as Tony's young assistant Harley Keener and also in this movie is Ben Kingsley as The Mandarin who will impress you and let you down all in one. Overall i was impressed ins some parts and in others I was disappointed and obviously no movie is perfect but this movie had more faults than improvements but Iron man ending on some high notes and honestly it was solid entry but i would have to re watch it over time.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

","First of all, let me dismiss every bad review here. They are just angry that the script didn't follow more of the comic book world---which by the way, sucks anyways. This is by far the best of the Iron Man series. The movie starts slow...and then builds into major action. I won't give any details away, but the movie script is good, the character development is good, and the special effects are mind blowing. I WANT to offend all those that gave the movie a poor rating...and say...get a life (it's not the worst Marvel movie ever). I would probably go see this movie again if I could afford it.

","I could not help but to feel...cheated...fooled...swindled into thinking I was going to be completely satisfied with the film. I will say first of all Robert Downey Jr. sells the film as usual by portraying the billionaire Tony Stark with accuracy. Which brings to me to the bad news, at least bad news for those of us who are familiar with the Marvel Universe. When I first heard Ben Kingsley was cast as the Mandarin I accepted it with open arms, he does not look oriental in any way compared to the classic Mandarin villain. Yet, I was willing to compromise, being that he is a great actor. What follows can be labeled as SPOILER!! material. A while back Marvel went on record stating they were not sure how they were going to address the Mandarin as a villain. I figured they had it in the bag since he was clearly displayed in the trailers, Ten Rings and all. So it was bit of a thwarted surprise when the Mandarin's character is simply a decoy in the film. Yes a decoy! Ironman's greatest archenemy was used as bait. Bait for all of those with any knowledge of who the Mandarin really was to feel that excitement of seeing Ironman square off against his deadliest foe. For those with no knowledge of who the Mandarin is will most likely go on about their day without noticing any wrong doing. The action is great, character chemistry is present much more than the previous standalone Ironman film. My gripe is the way they treated the Mandarin villain. The Mandarin is simply a diversion in order to bring to light the real villain of the film...Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce). Are you kidding me Marvel? Aldrich Killian, a character known in the Marvel universe as a cripple scientist who commits suicide after letting his work get into the hands of a terrorist group. I understand Marvel's approach to keeping story fresh and new but if you can imagine a Batman film in which the Joker is used merely as a decoy to bring on the real villain of the Scarcrow....Nope that will not work. The anticipation for the Mandarin has been built and as far as I'm concerned Marvel did not deliver the Mandarin the way he should have been brought to the screen. Instead we get Pearce's character breathing fire while having tattooed dragons on his chest. Oh and if your looking for the Ten Rings I hope your OK with just quick glimpse of Kingsley's knuckles because besides that, they are not mentioned at all in the film. Yet Killian manages to mutter to Stark ""You wanted the Mandarin Tony?, I am the Mandarin"" and we are supposed to swallow that Marvel? If they were looking for a twist they got but it came at a price. No one who invested time in reading Ironman books would appreciate the neglected Mandarin that was force fed to us in this film. That said, Shane Black did a good job at putting Tony Stark through situations without his armor that still managed to highlight Stark's intelligence and skill with mechanics. All hope is not lost though, even with all that transpired a clever writer can bring back the true Mandarin at a later point in the saga and give it the respect the character deserves.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

","This post includes SPOILERS!! I thought the movie was spectacular!! Great plot, wonderful acting by all involved, exciting action. With that being said, I do have to comment about a few inconsistencies between this movie and the previous two. At least they appear to be inconsistencies to me and I am appealing to my fellow fans to either confirm my suspicions or dispute them. First, I thought that the miniature ARC reactor in Tony Stark's chest not only powered the electromagnet to keep shrapnel away from his heart but also powered the Iron Man suit. But in Iron Man 3, the suit runs out of power and must be recharged. I question this on the fact that in the original Iron Man, Obadiah Stane incapacitates Stark and steals the ARC reactor from him to power his own creation. Second, the Iron Man suit is ""keyed"" to Stark (as confirmed by Stark in the final action scene) and another Iron Man suit is supposedly ""keyed"" to his friend Colonel James Rhodes for use as ""The War Machine"". But in this movie, Rhodes is captured and forced out of the suit and then the suit is used by one of the bad guys as a ""trojan horse"". If it is ""keyed"" to Rhodes, how was the bad guy able to use it? Third, and last, Stark tells Jarvis to destroy all the Iron Man suits and in the end scene throws the ARC reactor into the sea. How can it end like this when there is an Avengers 2 in the works that supposedly includes Iron Man?",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

In the initial 45 minutes I was always excusing what was happening up to that point, giving it a chance and expecting it to get much better Then I realized that wasn't going to happen, in fact it only got worse, the script was everywhere, it had so much idiocy it that I went into desperation.

","So iron man 3 is a movie about tony stark still creating really cool advancements of his iron man suits and making new types and variations of technology like how to call upon his suits with hand movements and being able to self assemble them around his entire body at his beccing call. But then, unknown helicopters that were sent in to attack stark's home and try to kill him by shooting at him with a bunch of guns and missiles which eventually led to him getting lost out in the wilderness with a bunch of snow and his AI assistant Jarvis powers down leaving stark all on his own to figure out who did this and how to get back home to fix everything that happened and after a while stark figures out that the helicopter attack was from a person named the manderain who invented something called the extremis virus and injected it into loads of people making them have fire kinetic abilities and giving them a whole load of other physical attributes and capabilities basically turning them into killer juggernaut soldiers. But then stark finds the manderain and he explains to him that he is just a normal guy who is pretending to be him and the real manderain is actually a vengeful scientist named Aldrich Killian who was actually the one who is responsible for ALL of this and stark figures out that pepper potts his wife has been captured and also tony got captured as well but he calls upon all of his iron man suits to assist him in the final fight again Mr Killian and he also finds out that pepper potts has the extremis virus but she is immuned to becoming evil with certain effects and then after that both of them move into a new home and iron man decides to retire by legit blowing up all of his suits as a firework show and also getting surgery to remove the need for his arc reactor so that he can live without it from now on. So this movie to a lot of people is severely underrated in my opinion and to be honest this is my all time favorite iron film out of all of the ones i have seen because this one is fan service at it's finest and i would love to talk about why i love this movie so darn much. Okay so first of all tony stark's personality is still as clever and cocky and humorous as ever always having the best lines and dialogue ever and he also has created so many brand new iron man suits with so many different abilities and superpowers along with some awesome transformation sequences and if you know iron man then you probably know that iron man has like the greatest transformations when ever he puts on an iron man suit because it's not only the most satisfying thing i've ever seen but it also looks so cool seeing the suit remoteriolize around stark with a bunch of really satisfying robotic sounds and there are loads and i mean LOADS of different iron man suits and transformations in this movie and i love that more than a lot of things on this planet. Also the maderain is an original comic book villain and is also stark's nemesis in the comics and it was really cool seeing him in this movie. Also the extremis virus for all of these other bad guys actually makes them dangerous and menacing because in a lot of movies i've seen minions are supposed to be like characters that are just waiting to get beaten up by the good guys and nothing more but in here these extremis soldiers are an actual treat and they nearly kill tony and his friend rodey but their superpowers and physical abilities are so incredibly powerful that only one of them can single handedly take out an entire iron man suit and that is an extremely hard feat to pull off even for just a minion or henchman in a movie. Also there is an iron patriot suit that represents america in this movie and as an american i appreciate that so very much. Also when pepper died in this movie or at least it makes it look like she died actually made me cry because then when tony saw the manderain approaching him after that he was furious and really put up a good fight with. Also the climax of the movie where the manderain almost dies from an explosion but then when pepper comes out of the flames and just proceeds to kick his axe was was just so darn cool to see. Also the final fight with all of tony stark's mcu iron man suits over the years with them all coming together and activating them with an extreme pregatice mode was fan service at it finest once again. Also the airplane scene where iron man falls out of an exploding airplane with everybody on it falling out into the sky to their deaths but then iron man legit forms a human chain by working together with everybody on the way down and that was just such an awesome scene filled with Tony making funny lines as well. Also the mark 42 testing scene was the most hilarious scene in the whole mcu i've ever seen because of how badly the test goes and tony dancing to record music but also the ending where the suit all comes together but then one piece flies right at him breaking the whole suit. Also Tony Stark creates his very own alternative gadgets and weapons for a break in scene to manderains house that involves explosive christmas ornaments and evena stable blaster and using a flipping gun and pointing it right at Manderian's head through his whole interrogation scene. Also after the final fight of the movie where stark activates a protticall that blows up all of his iron man suits by using fireworks as an explosive all around the sky showing that he only cares about pepper and wants to spend time with her and not to be preoccupied with tinkering all day and goes through character development was such a wonderful thing to see for an ending to such a wonderful movie. Also the final fight between ironman and the manderain with iron man actually seeming like he was going to die several times and having such close calls but rapidly changing iron man suits throughout the fight was such a cool thing to see. So in conclusion, this movie is severely underrated in my opinion and adds so much to tony stark's personality and his relationship with pepper and how he has changed over time as a person and wanting to spend more time with the one that he loves the most. So what would i rate this movie on a scale of 1 to 10, a straight up 10 no questions asked this was the perfect conclusion for the iron man series in the mcu.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

The subplot for the vice president is never elaborated or explained, just kind of brushed off. Seeing Robert Downey Jrs.

","This movie is so bad that I have trouble sleeping at night. I have cold sweat nightmares, where I imagine Shane Black holding down the Iron Man suit and rapping him. I would go on and on with evidence as to why this movie is so bad, but I think the majority of the reviews speak for themselves. Before, anyone bashes me for being pro comic book or a genuine nerd. Let me first say that I have thought that Marvel had done a great job creating movies before this one. I did not have too much of a problem with Iron Man 2. This movie however is awful from start to finish. I hope Marvel can salvage this franchise and quit trying to make comic book movies as ""realistic"" as possible. They are comic book movies, they are not suppose to be real. You are writing sci-fi fiction, cut it out with the realism guys. My biggest gripe with the movie and it has been said by just about everybody on this review forum is The Mandarin. We were all fouled into thinking that an iconic super villain would take on a classic super hero. A show down that would set both on a path of awesome CGI destruction. I was unsure of how this would play out but I knew this was the show down we all wanted. The first two movies had less than quality show downs. The Mandarin is the biggest they could do and it's because of his abilities and his goal of ruling over all and destroying Iron Man. Ultimo, Fin Fang Foom, Justin Hammer, Zeke Stane (Obadaih's son) and others would come to his side in order to destroy Iron Man. The leader of SHIELD Tech, Leader inside SHIELD and friend to most all other super heroes. Cutting down Iron Man would hurt War Machine, Pepper Potts, and everybody. This movie gave us nothing. When Happy went into a coma, I have to be honest, I felt nothing. When Stark found the Mandarin's lair, I was like, yes! That quickly switched to yells of pain.

1036,29 June 2015,danielloe,5," Lazy writing; a big disappointment
","*WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* I'm going to be honest, I am not the biggest MCU fan. I really like the movies in Phase one, I even like Iron Man 2 and the Incredible Hulk. Phase two... meh. That being the case, I was already on the side of Iron Man movies when I saw this, and am a big superhero movie fan, so for this movie to lose me as much as it did... that's a true feat. This time though, being a fan of the comics actually makes you like the movie less. Even though I hated this movie the first time I saw it, I have grown to enjoy it a little bit. That being said, I still consider this movie to be sub-par. Why? Well, here are just a few reasons. The Mandarin. Yes, this is what I meant by saying if you like the comics, you won't like this movie. The Mandarin is not a menacing super villain armed with alien technology, he's not a warlord, he is not in anyway THE Iron Man villain, in fact... he's not even a villain. The Mandarin is a figure head used by the real villain (more on him in a bit) to draw the attention of the U.S., and not only that, but they took the twist one step farther and turned him into a punch line; he's nothing more than a drunk actor masquerading as a terrorist. And that... no, just no. Look, I understand the comics have to be adapted, I get that, I understand even very popular characters might not be suited for the big screen, I get that too, but the one thing you shouldn't do is disrespect the source material. Taking a few jokes at the dumber moments from the comics is alright (even the actual comic books do that), but this isn't a poke at the comics, this is a slap in the face to the fans, and this instantly put me firmly on the side of against Iron Man 3. This could've been a good twist if they'd used like a c-list villain, but the #1 Iron Man villain? No, that just doesn't work. Another big problem I have with this movie is the massive changes to Tony Stark. I didn't like them. I like seeing Tony looking like he's in trouble, but it should actually be the villain of the movie who breaks him, not just the villain from Avengers. We should see Aldrich Killian (or preferably; The Mandarin) break Tony, push him to his breaking point, and see Tony come back, rise up, and defeat his enemy. A bit like TDKR, but that wouldn't be the only thing they copied from The Dark Knight Rises. Seeing Tony having panic attacks and anxiety issues over the mere mention of the events in The Avengers is a little too much though, and the real villain, Aldrich Killian, is a disposable bad guy for Tony to struggle with for two hours, he's not an arch-nemesis, he's not anything important to Tony, he's just another villain to kill off. Not exactly the way your trilogy you should go out. Another problem I had was all the plot holes, but I try to overlook plot holes whenever possible, because, I'm more interested in the story and characters than every little detail. Still, Tony not bringing out his suits earlier in the movie is a glaring issue that I have a hard time ignoring. Problem #5: the mechanized suits. I know this is in the comics, but having Tony pilot his suits by remote control, and making an army of suits that are easily disposable? I'm pretty sure this movie confirmed at least three of the Five Nightmares from that epic story line (c'mon, you know you wanna see Ezekiel Stane! A villain who could rival RDJ for screen presence? Oh yeah!). Also, it makes Tony not feel particularly special. He just builds the suits, why not just let someone else hold the remote? I have one last problem with this movie and with most of the Phase two movies in general. Joke overload. Seriously, there are too many jokes in this movie, and they are very ill-timed. I don't mind alleviating some tension with a bit of humor, but this movie just straight up has no tension, and that makes me lose interest pretty quickly to be honest. However, I still find Iron Man 3 to be very enjoyable, in a mindless kind of way. Once you realize it isn't very good, it's actually a pretty easy movie to have fun with. It's not like Batman & Robin bad, it's just not very good. In the end, Iron Man 3 is a sub par movie, with good action, good effects, lazy writing, a weak story, and a bad tone.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

And yet I thought they picked THE PERFECT ACTOR to play the Mandarin too! Such a disappointment that they wasted his talent, especially since the antagonist (Aldrich Killian) was a laughable substitute with a nearly spoof-like backstory and shallow motivations.

Guy Pearce also plays a pretty awesome villain and Ben Kingsley nails it as the Mandarin. Don Cheadle however is a different story. He does not have a lot of scenes and he does not have an important role in this movie....Jon Favreau had more of a role here than him which is a shame, since in the comics War Machine actually becomes Iron Man for a time. And Some humor does not always work in this movie because it feels like fart jokes a lot of times. Also do not expect to see a lot of Iron Man in this film and even when he you do the suit breaks apart almost immediately. The reason why I give it a 5 is because of a scene during the 2nd half of the film which ruins everything about the Iron Man saga which the comic book fans came to expect.

In this movie it seemed like they focused on one thing he can do with suit ( make it come to him) he did this about 10 times in the movie. This focus made the other ""powers"" of the suit fade into the back. Another point I feel the need to share is they didn't go into the antidote enough and all the sudden he breaths fire!!!??? Was just crazy and out of no where I think a lot of explaining is needed for the antidote.

","Any film, no matter how hot the franchise is or has been, needs a plot and some coherence. This film had neither in my opinion. I, luckily, waited and rented it on DVD, but still feel like I wasted my money. Robert Downy, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, and Rebecca Hall did a good job with a horrible plot line and terrible dialogue, but that's not enough to save a terrible film. If you want to know how the producers, director, writers and crew could waste so much money producing this bad a film, look at the bonus features on the DVD. The sole feature is 17 minutes on how they made repeated skydives to make the special effects sequences of about a minute of the 130 minute movie realistic because computer graphic images (cgi) are not. Then after shooting all these skydives they replaced the real background and much of the actors parts with cgi. Instead of telling a story, they spent the majority of the production time playing and being fascinated with special effects. That may have amused some of the cast and the crew, but does not and will not amuse or entertain the audience. What a terrible shame.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

","I had read many negative reviews about this movie before watching it but now that I have seen it myself, I beg to differ. The problem is that a superhero movie is stereotyped to be an action comedy movie for kids or teenagers. However, the trend is now changed. The superhero movies are now getting more into Drama and emotions. Iron Man 3 and Dark Knight Rises are same in this regard. In both movies, the superhero is seen as a normal person 90% of the movie and wears his costume in the end. But it is bigger than this. Iron Man 3 shows that a superhero is also a human. They can have emotional troubles like other people. Tony is suffering from Panic Attacks, he is having trouble in his personal life as well – Just like normal humans! I think there is a lot to be learned from this movie, if you watch it with an open mind. Don't expect to see Iron man flying here and there killing the bad guys throughout the movie. There is enough action at the end of the movie. I would recommend it to Iron mans, it's a must watch!",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

","Well, it's happened again for the armored Avenger. It's no wonder that everyone is again praising Iron Man in some way. Iron Man 3 is a best comic adaptation worthy to follow the greatness known as The Avengers. The original Iron Man may have surpassed every original installment of any superhero film to date. The sequel advanced the character of Tony Stark while setting up Avengers quite nicely. Iron Man 3 goes beyond even that and when you start at the remarkably high level that the first film achieved, that's saying something. It manages to deliver everything with the same style and integrity of the first film but adds more intensity, drama and action. Again, like the original, Iron Man 3 is a film everyone can enjoy because it cares enough to deliver excellence on every front. The remarkable cast more than delivers and Cheadle's Rhodey was certainly an upgrade over his role in the second film. The story itself is told in a masterful, crisp manner featuring the great dialogue that we all now expect from Marvel films. It's witty and uses the perfect use of humor yet again although this is by far the darkest film in the trilogy. The plot features advancement and complex characterization all the way through. Add the huge comic book style scenes and slugfests that were lacking from the first and you have what ten years from now people will be calling the best number three movie ever made. Yes, better than Return of the King.

1083,2 March 2014,WheelzFourReelz,7," Iron Man 3 is an enjoyable, albeit disappointing, conclusion to the Iron Man trilogy
","If there was any movie that I was really excited for at the beginning of the year, it was Iron Man 3. The trailers of that movie looked awesome! Recently, I went to go see the movie with my entire middle school. Was it as good as I thought it was going to be? Not quite. In this movie, Tony Stark is having a moral crisis. He's having nightmares and he's gotten crazy with creating suites. Meanwhile, a new villain named The Mandarin comes in and threatens America. Tony must find out the secret behind the Mandarin and discover himself as well. Okay, now onto the review. The story of Tony Stark is good. It shows more of an intense, serious side of Tony, which is nice to see. But it is ruined by the plot behind The Mandarin. It's really dorky and cheesy. It tries to be funny, but it comes off stupid with one of the most unnecessary plot twists ever. I'm not going to spoil what happens, but it's disappointing. It's too bad, because the first half of the movie was doing great! When the plot twist happened, it got ruined. Another problem I have with the movie is the humor. I know they're trying to be funny and quirky, but some of the jokes come out forced and unnecessary. I was kind of hoping it would be more serious, dark, and intense. Nope. The jokes are still funny and definitely chuckle worthy, but some of them weren't needed. What also bugged me was that Iron Man 3 didn't have enough Iron Man in it. Yes, Tony Stark made a lot of suites, and yes, he fights in them, but that's about it. This is more about Tony Stark as a person, and not as much as him as Iron Man. They could've called this movie ""Tony Stark- The Movie"" and be just fine. You may think I hate this movie from the looks of it, but the movie is actually pretty good. It had a lot of good elements, like the acting. The acting is good and believable. Sometimes you can see the stress in people. I may have complained that there isn't enough ""Iron Man"" in the movie, but it's also pretty good. It makes Tony a really believable and relatable character. I like how he acts less of a playboy and more of a man with his own weaknesses and more vulnerability. This is nice! I like this! The best part of this movie is the special effects. They are amazing. (WARNING: SPOILER ALERT): My jaw literally dropped when Stark's tower collapsed. (SPOILER OVER) They looked so realistic and cool! Very flashy! The fight scenes are very flashy as well. It's pretty intense and exciting. It's probably the most brutal Iron Man movie yet! Overall, the movie was good, but disappointing. It had a lot of good elements, like the story behind Iron Man, the acting, the believability of Tony Stark, the special effects, and the fight scenes. What really hurt the movie was the Mandarin plot. It's a good movie, but it's not as good as Iron Man 1 or 2. It's still definitely worth a watch.

Although maybe fans of the comics should give this a wide berth. When I read that the Extremis storyline was going to be the basis of the film I was excited, but this film doesn't retain the dark brooding tone that I would come to expect from such a story arc.

1110,8 April 2019,staticstation1,," I AM IRON MAN... AGAIN!
","Here we have a film that is divisive, to say the least. When this film was first released, I was on the negative side. I was young and wanted action, action, and more action. But over time this film has grown for me, and on the positive side. This is a character piece and a strong one of that. It's a film that takes risks and a film where Downey is at his best as this iconic character within the MCU and comic book fandom.
POSITIVES
Something to admire about this plot is that it takes the character in a different and welcomed direction. Tony Stark is as important of a character as Iron Man and to have him and his powerful mind being the draw and the lead was very entertaining. This goes into the writing of this character and their story. The path the film takes is very interesting and faces the repercussions of the Battle of New York. This helps to maintain this shared universe and not have them be offbeat stories. Robert Downey Jr. is incredible in this role and he takes this character and performance to new heights. Yes, there is the sarcastic humour that the character is known for, but there is some real and powerful emotion that the actor develops in his face alone. Downey still maintains that incredible and natural chemistry with his co-stars and that elevates their performances as well. For what Ben Kingsley does in the role of The Mandarin, he is very entertaining. Shane Black takes over the director's chair and he does a very good job. The film has its different tone, but still has that ""realistic"" quality that Favreau set up in the first two films. Some very good visual effects that come with the Iron Man sequences. What they do with the multiple Iron Man suits in this film was so fun and helped ground the film in the comic book realm. Anyone that knows the character knows about the multiple armours that the character creates. The sound design that I've praised before is still present in this film. Along with new sounds that are strong. This is the first film, in the Iron Man franchise, that has a great and memorable score from Brian Tyler. And overall the film is fun. It has its humour and engaging action sequences, but also, a lot of heart.
NEGATIVES!
The main negatives I have with this film involve the villains. Even though this film was released in 2013, no spoilers. What the film does with the character of The Mandarin I am mixed on. It upsets comic book fans but makes sense in the narrative of the film. My main negative is the story of Aldrich Killian and Guy Pearce's performance. I mean, 1. it's Syndrome from Disney/Pixar's The Incredibles. 2. it's boring. Pearce gives a portrayal of a cynical villain that has been done before and all the ""humour"" that the character/actor tries to deliver falls flat. Not once is this villain threatening or memorable.
CONCLUSION!
So, Iron Man 3 gets a bad rep and it doesn't deserve it. I am kind of a hypocrite since I have ridiculed this film in the past, but I've grown and so has my appreciation for this film. If you are looking for an MCU film that is not-stop action, I can't see you enjoying this Iron Man instalment, but if you are looking for a superhero film that takes risks with its material and character, then I suggest you check out Iron Man 3.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

","So the favorite super hero of millions Iron Man and its third installment arrived at the theaters with full swing and of course this time in a much grand canvas.With the gigantic production cost Marvel pictures have left no stone unturned in any of the departments say it casting, acting, special effects or the marketing. To start with, the famous sense of humor of Mr. Tony Stark this time forms a combo with the true emotions and finally Miss Pepper Potts finds the caring, sharing side of Mr.Stark for her. The chemistry between the couple has been the trade mark of the franchisee, though this time Mr. Shane Black with the director's hat emphasized on the romantic side of the super hero. Terrorism at the heart with the commingle of American politics, this time the baddie Mandarin reaches the secure zone of WHITE HOUSE and his demand for a call from the Prez and the resulting betrayal and Miss Pepper falling from 200 ft height was perhaps the two shocking moment that turned the reel world and the real world silent for a while. The DNA Coding and the resulting fire power which has been used as the lethal weapon by Mr.Mandarin stands believable but again somewhat repetitive and falls into the category of the same age old Hollywood action formula of mutation and desolation. The audience will definitely be spellbound by the special effects but somehow the movie wrapped up being an action-romantic outing. The revelation of Mr. Ben Kingsley as the fake Mandarin was a little earlier and that is the only loop hole in the screenplay that I felt. Overall the movie is a full on entertainer and all the checklists of a super hero movie is ticked.Children gonna love it, adults gonna like it and we poor reviewers like it but with some Ifs and buts..

","There is no doubt that there was a lot of excitement leading up to Iron Man 3, but there were also a lot of skeptics due to the change in directors. Jon Favereau, who directed the last two films, has been replaced with Shane Black, writer of Lethal Weapon one and two, as well as director of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. Immediately the audience can identify this due to a darker tone and a different style of humor. The humor is very funny yet kind of seems out of place. It's like if there is a build up of exciting or dramatic moments, ending with surprisingly funny situation. One place I believe Iron Man 3 succeeds over the other two films is the supporting characters. To be honest, the supporting cast of the last two films never really had too much impact, it was mostly Tony Stark's show. In this movie I was able to see that Pepper was more influential than ever, being the cause of most of the actions Tony takes, Rodey now is much more of a help to Tony and has a completely different role to play. As this is a new chapter in the franchise expect to see to new characters either helping or hurting Tony Stark, most important, of course, is Guy Pierce's Aldrich Killian and Ben Kingsley's Mandarin.

For starters my biggest complaint is that we don't see that much of Iron Man and when we do his suit is always running low on power or malfunctioning. Another issue I had is that the movie had useless characters who could have easily been written out of the movie or combined with another character to save on time. I also felt that the movie ran about 20-30 minutes too long. Another issue I have with the movie is if Iron Man can get thrashed around by Thor's Hammer and keep coming back for more; then why do his suits end up getting destroyed so easily in this movie? Also they bring up the fact that Tony suffers from PTSD but they don't really address it beyond bringing it up. Oh and why did Tony let the Mandarin's forces destroy his house when he had an entire army of iron man suits hidden that could have taken out the the handful of helicopters that were sent to attack him!? Overall it was still a fun ride even if the plot was like iron man's suit; barely functional.,/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

I felt this film played more as a comic book than the other two films, and was slightly darker then one and two. People sometimes fail to realize changing the director can change the general feel of the film, which i admit, was the case here. To claim this was ""the worst comic book film ever"" is absolutely ridiculous, take a look at Ghost Rider 2 and get back to me. I will say, the 3D in this one wasn't very impressive, but aside from that i found it to be a great film, worthy of the franchise, with a small twist and a tremendous final sequence that makes up for the story-driven beginning. One word of advice, unless your a die hard Iron Man fan, I suggest skipping the ""Easter Egg"" after the credits.

There are few good guys to cheer for, the VP is corrupted, the President is a corporate lackey, the ex girl friend waffles between good and evil like she was deciding what pair of shoes to buy. The kid who befriends The Mechanic is so contrived that he is hardly memorable, but just so that you do recall the vague lad, the child is rewarded with gadgets and gizmo's in his dilapidated barn/garage.

","was watching Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and suddenly an Iron Man movie broke out. I'm sorry. That was rude. Okay, let me be clear. I love Iron Man. I love Robert Downey Jr.. I love Shane Black. And I've admitted many times that RDJ could spew out Black's dialogue in a film about recycling Coke bottles and I'd watch. It's just that Iron Man 3 does everything it can to test that loyalty. Is it as good as Avengers? Of course not. Is it the best film of the trilogy? Not in my opinion. Is it better than Iron Man 2? I'm not so sure I can say that. To be honest, Iron Man 3 is a different genre than Iron Man 2 and even Iron Man 1. And that is where my hesitance to tout it comes from. When I first heard that Shane Black was doing part 3, I was psyched. The man has made a living of making great action comedies for years. Lethal Weapon, Last Boy Scout, and Long Kiss Goodnight, to name a few. However, the things I loved about those films is that despite the humor and comedic interactions, you could suddenly find yourself in a gritty, bloody, hardcore shootout. Humorous scenes suddenly turned on their ear by a visceral murder. A suicidal breakdown. Revenge at any cost. And Black could weave these things effortlessly. Even though those films had the help of an R rating, I had faith that Black could still come close to delivering a little taste of this in Iron Man 3. Especially with the threat of Tony Stark's biggest comic book nemesis, The Mandarin, looming over the storyline. The tone from the commercials also seemed to hint at the darkest plot we'd seen for the character. However, Iron Man 3 turns away from Martin Riggs, Charly Baltimore, and Joe Hallenbeck and leans more toward Gay Perry and Harry Lockhart. In other words, Iron Man 3 is not an action comedy.

And they've done this with Iron Man by incorporating the best of the Classic IM comics (Gold/Silver age) and the modern 2000's IM comics. And in so doing, they've been challenging and surprising us consistently along the way. What Iron Man fan would've ever expected the speech that Tony Stark gives at the end of Iron Man 1 to go the way it did...in the FIRST film? Who would've thought that they'd actually find a way to realistically depict the 'suitcase suit' as they did in IM2? Or incorporate SHIELD so seamlessly (including its otherwise preposterous carrier, as in Avengers)? So, you have to really go into these Iron Man movies with an open mind, because you never know what to expect...and maybe never more so than Iron Man 3. Make no mistake: there is at least 1 character that is so drastically changed from its comic origins that it will likely upset a lot of fans.

","Perhaps one of the laws of fiction, is that despite being fiction, the approach of history must be credible, as the magician's trick, plausible before our eyes, impossible within the rational but we want to believe. And Iron Man, a character rescued from lesser known Marvel comic books, is proposed since 2008 the beginning of a saga that draws, in my opinion, so that the contemporary world shows how the ideal or aspirational it to be: a successful playboy , millionaire, eccentric, intelligent and creative character named Tony Stark. The story, from its inception, has developed some traumas of Tony personal conflicts, friendly and loving. The mixture has attractive, its origin is traumatic, Tony Stark, untouchable, suffers an attack, is kidnapped, gets his lesson for being a creator and arms dealer who does not mind the conflicts and deaths caused by their having capitalist participates. Stark underwent surgery with an implant energy that prevents shrapnel it reaches the heart. So goes Iron Man and its sequel. But among the laws of history, in the third installment, Tony Stark attacked by anxiety attack mid-40s, starring many of the sequences of the plot of Iron Man 3 WITHOUT the armor that provides Iron Man, no longer attractive. While this is part of their trauma, the creation of 50 or more Ironmans detracts from the unique, the unusual, the reified in that symbolic element of the representation of the hero, the icon. This is a law of the comic book hero. The second law in failing Iron Man is a character, an icon should not break apart physically. Abused And this film the armor is now decomposed and recomposed and travels through the territory, handled virtually. These dynamic changes in history are slowly draining the movie to a mediocre one third version of the Iron Man comics stories often develop the conflict of man a hero, one who acquires ordinary supernatural powers and becomes unique and exceptional. But mortal man without powers, meritorious connotes building a character that will power, mind, desire for revenge and to do good, it conforms itself by gadgets, cloak, armor, almost supernatural human strength. In his case, the mere mortal strengthened, Batman, given for a unique trilogy of Christopher Nolan, in which, in the end, Bane literally bankrupt and breaks the mask over his face. This collapse is part of history, the rebirth of the hero who runs towards the end of the authentic self, his future, his lost love. But in Iron Man Character decomposition is his undoing. The character is disrupted, then the film falls apart.

Third Law: the hero is the sole bearer of its symbols, communication image it projects. Even Pepper Pots have acquired powers survives.

Add to this a new treat that is possibly the biggest that he has faced alone. The armour is in the next stage of evolution and its quite cool seeing it come together. Its not only Tony but all the major characters here that get considerably meatier story arch. Although the tone of the movie is same as those movies that preceded it - light. There is a twist midway through that very few will see it coming. I would think it was a Joss Whedon touch. The end fight is huge and spectacular in scale and effects. In the end of it all, tony has grown, matured up and realizes the important things in life. Though this character movement is not shown in a very sensible way and not very convincing. All of a sudden, he is more mature and he has moved on. Oh and there is an Easter Egg scene here at the end of credits though you really won't miss much if you don't wait for it.

","The third installment in the Iron Man franchise is an entertaining movie like the first two, however i think of it as being a little dull when compared to the first two. The storyline is great, and actually a bit more interesting than others among these marvel superhero movies. Yet, it's ability to draw excitement is a bit watered down by the lack of Iron Man actually using his skills and the constant precense of jokes. Don't get me wrong - the jokes are good, and the movie itself is very laughable. Nevertheless, its hard to take a movie that is meant to thrill you seriously when much of is taken a sort of ironic distance to. It's as if the movie doesn't take itself seriously. But I must admit, that i did indeed like this movie and I can't help admiring every minute of Robert Downey Jr. playing this lovable asshole. Not to mention Guy Pearce's excellent acting as the total, yet tragic asshole. When it all comes down this movie is not the most thrilling experience, but it has good humour and some redeeming action scenes and actors.

A sequel to both Iron Man 2 and The Avengers simultaneously, the movie deals with Tony Stark, developing a crippling case of an anxiety disorder who obsesses over creating more and more Iron Man suits to be prepared for any possible attack. After dealing with Gods, aliens, and living legends, Tony has realized that he and his loved ones are more vulnerable to attack than he originally thought. This couldn't come at a worse time as a new terrorist bogeyman, The Mandarin, has begun a campaign of fear with an almost mythical sense of anonymity. After one particular attack that hits close to home, Stark publicly challenges The Mandarin, leading to a retaliation where Stark is on the run relying on his wits, rather than his armor, to save the day.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

","OK... let me start by saying I personally watch movies for either two reasons: either to be entertained or to enjoy great acting and cinematography ( directing, photography, writing, etc), sometimes a movie get kudos on both aspects, sometimes, just on one, sometimes just fail miserably. Iron Man 3 is a movie to watch to be entertained... period. I am not expert of the superhero mythology, so I cannot have an opinion on that. The plot start at some point in time after the events where the Avengers save the world in NYC. Yes, there are some development on the character of Tony Stark.. that self-centered, egocentric, and eccentric billionaire that Mr Downey Jr. has played so well on the previous three movies ( including The Avengers), he will realize even when he is Iron Man, he's still human, so the lesson that he will learn is that being in the limelight does have a cost, and sometimes that cost might affect and even make you lose the people around you. I do think this is the movie of the series that have tried ( because not all are good) to exploit the joke element the most..I let you be the judged of that. I still do think that the first movie is the best. As for the villain? well, personally I think for entertaining purposes and my personal rating, that's exactly why this one does not rate better for me , and once again, personally, the worst of the villains Iron Man has faced so far...why? simple...they never explained the reason WHY he do it, plus a big disappointed for me when Tony finally faces The Mandarin. If you enjoyed the previous two, would you be disappointed on the third? Absolutely not, but you might step out of the theather sharing one of the more repeated commentary on all movie blockbuster sagas since Star Wars : ""It was good, but the first one is still the best for me""- Enjoy.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

Tony has anxiety problems at the start of the film but just disappears in the middle for no reason. Rhodey says he prefers the War Machine suit to the Iron Patriot suit but doesn't get to be War Machine during the big fight at the end. Tony doesn't take Extremis so he doesn't get his powers to control machines. The Mandarin was not the incredible character he is in the comic with his magic rings. Instead he was a front that Killian used to steer the public eye away from him. Shane Black completely destroyed Iron Man's arch enemy. The Mandarin is to 'Iron man 3' as Deadpool is to X-men Origins. Despite the movie being called 'Iron Man 3' it was Pepper who beat the main villain. Tony mainly sent the suit into battle whilst he controlled it from a safe distant which is the same as a character going through an incredible adventure then we find out it was all a dream. After the final battle Tony sets all his suits to self destruct just to make a few fireworks. The film was supposed to be about Tony surviving on his own devices yet he gets help from a small boy. Tony makes the suit fly onto Pepper at the beginning of the film but says to Rhodey during the big fight that he can't put a suit on him because their only tailored for Tony. At the end of the film Tony has his Arc Reactor and the Shrapnel removed from his heart and then throws his Arc Reactor away after saying in 'The Avengers' ""It's a part of me now"".

","I really love this movie because it's so unique. The ""cool"" factor is still there but there's a twist and depth I didn't see coming. How Tony deals with his form of post-traumatic stress after the events of Avengers is actually dealing with it in a way you've never seen from a superhero. Tony is motivated to do better when he realizes that he's not a god; just a genius in a suit, trying to up his game. He has always thought of himself as top dog and knew he was a narcissist. Now, the notion that he has encountered beings and situations that make him feel small plays big as the movie starts. He has been to space/another dimension, nearly gotten killed by crazed aliens, met a god that can throw lightning bolts and smash him across the forest with a hammer, has encountered a legend that his father used to talk about that lives up to the legend. His confidence is shaken and has diminished. He knows true fear and he feels like, unless he can build the perfect man through armor and technology, he's going to be outdone and overwhelmed. Fury perfectly pointed it out in Avengers when he said, ""We are hilariously, hopelessly outgunned."" This is where the movie gets really interesting. There's a reason why he's building armor and why he's much more comfortable when he's in the suit. Those suits are taken away from him. He's just a man and he can't possibly compete at the level the world and events in this movie now demand. That is the impetus for the entire story. Strip down the character, rip everything off him and leave him ""naked"" against these incredible forces. Without the armor, The Avengers or his resources, the man must find the strength from within himself, especially within his mind. A lot of this exceptional journey is Tony learning to become Tony Stark again outside the armor. It's an amazing and refreshing direction they choose to take. His emotional response is believable and is appropriate.

","Since the conclusion of Marvel's The Avengers last summer, everyone has been begging for details about how the 2012 juggernaut will impact Iron Man III. The list of questions has been endless, but the biggest question (outside of plot points) is can Iron Man III live up to the worldwide success of The Avengers? The fact is The Avengers is the biggest summer blockbuster of all-time. It sits at number three on the list of the top-grossing films of all-time. So, how do you follow that kind of success? The easiest way to answer that question is to just admit that it's silly to think any film will ever top The Avengers in terms of success – at least for any other comic book film, that is. We saw The Dark Knight Rises fall in the aftermath of The Avengers, so if Chris Nolan's Batman couldn't surpass the success of The Avengers, how can another Iron Man sequel can do it? The answer to that question is: momentum. Simply put, the interest created by The Avengers will most likely thrust Iron Man III to heights most people couldn't possibly imagine. Regardless, this is just speculation and it's far too early to tell how Iron Man III will play out at the box office, but in terms of the overall quality of the film – well, we have that answer for you.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

","A wise man once said: we make our own demons. These first lines from the beginning of the movie were the ones which really impressed me. I had obviously gone with lots of hopes and expectations to watch the film, and unlike many people here who have reviewed this film quite badly, I actually enjoyed myself not just because it was good, but because finally, we got to know Tony Stark more than Iron Man. I believe the word, ""action"" and ""armor"" has been recently connected whenever ""Iron Man"" is mentioned, I mean, yes, obviously Iron Man is all about action and power, but one mustn't forget is that there should be some meaning too in the movie or just plain action destroys it, I believe this is the case for most of the people who were disappointed due to the less presence of the Iron Man as we saw Tony Stark more often! But I take this in a positive light, for as the comics always played more emphasis on Tony than it ever did to his counterpart and here, this whole movie is all about showing that Tony Stark can live without his super-armor and that he can still do wonders. I must compliment the director on his direction as this movie is full of twists and surprises, bringing in the most powerful villain in the Iron Man series and then declaring that the guy was an all time phony required quite much boldness. Also, the best part of the movie was that every five minutes, you could hear laughter erupting from every side, such is the charm and wittiness of the scenes. Now if the talk comes to the cast, well, I cannot say anything much. Robert Downey Jr. again shows why he and only he could ever be born to do such a role which he does to the utmost perfection. The co-cast of Ben Kingsley, Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle and Guy Pearce do a fine task of keeping up the movie along with the others. Perhaps the one scene which I won't be forgetting soon about the movie is when the Iron Man finally breaks down and Tony is left alone to walk in the snowy night, then the encounter with the teenage kid and all that followed were just fantastic. The music was pretty good and suited well with the scenes. Finally, all I can say is that the movie was quite different than what everyone expected, of course, it could have been better but the ending was perhaps far more unreal than anyone would expect of an Iron Man movie and it actually does the job pretty well. My final verdict, a good film with its own amazing comedic moments, great acting, a rather diverse script, a good enough music to go along with it. A must watch still for every ""movie"" fan out there for it still is a good movie in its own regard. Perhaps the best thing about this film was that there was a big meaning in it through which we finally get the answer to Captain America's question In the Avengers and that is, no matter what you take away from him or what you do to him, even if he has no super- powered suits to speak of, Tony Stark is always the Iron Man.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

The Avengers set a high bar for the Marvel franchise, it was an outstanding success became the third highest grossing film in cinema history. I am aware that the Marvel films are not to be taken seriously, these are supposed to be fun guy flicks with lots of action and witty one liners. That does not mean however, that every female character is either barely clad, about to have sex, or just had sex. The objectification of woman in this film is extraordinary. What's more they have no brains. Those that have lines are all damsels in distress. Second, the violence. One gets the feeling that Director and screenwriter Shane Black wanted to bring the franchise to the level of Christopher Nolan's Batman Trilogy. Shane therefore injects all sorts of violence towards innocent people, including a bombing in a city area, incredibly disrespectful due to the recent Boston incident. None of these events achieve the realism of Nolan's dark villains, and just makes the film quiet idiotic. A total let down and a stain on the Avengers franchise. Lastly the villains. According to the trailers and the first quarter of the film Sir Ben Kingsley was to portray the big baddie, the Mandarin. However he turns out to be a puppet for Guy Pierce's character. We are never told why Mr. Pierce's persona is killing all these people. However, would have been much better if it had been the other way round. The Mandarin a big bad guy and Peirce's character the lead henchman. But the ending is the final straw that broke the camels back. In order to declare his love for his wife/girlfriend, Pepper played by an uninteresting Gweneth Paltrow. Tony decides to destroy both his suits and Jarvis.

","Iron Man has always been one of my favorite Marvel heroes; He has a great character, his plots are always cool, and his suits always intrigued me. With that, I only have one question for Marvel. What happened with Iron Man 3? (Warning, ragey spoilers ahead.) Where to begin. Let's start with the villain. If the villain in Iron Man 3 were only to be AIM, that is completely fine. It'd be a cool science vs. science matchup where one works for evil and one works for good, that is totally fine. But why, oh why, would you bring in The Mandarin--an amazing super villain that would provide great battle scenes and CGI--in on it? It just doesn't make sense, and wasted a great opportunity. Secondly, if the point of Iron Man 3 was to humanize Tony Stark and make the suit less vital to the plot, that too is fine. But then WHY bring in 42 of them at the end? It just doesn't make sense! In the first two titles, each suit served a purpose to the storyline, and the viewer felt attached to it. Like the Mach 1 in the first title; it became the symbol of Tony Stark's escape. I had NO attachment to any of the suits, as he only was really around one, and it just was a comedic plot device, and done poorly. The only thing I really enjoyed of the movie were the one liners, which mostly had me laughing very hard; particularly the one of Tony and Harley on the street of Rose Hill. But one liners do not a movie make.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

Star Trek The Motion Picture is a perfect example. The trekkers, myself included, wanted the reunion of Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the rest.

","I found this film to be very disappointing. I have been a huge Iron man fan since I was very young, so I have been looking forward to this film for about a year and a half. The main issue I had with this film, was It's misuse of key characters: like the Mandarin, James Rhodes, and Maya Hansen. The film instead focuses on a stupid kid sidekick, ""super pepper"" and a fire breathing Aldrich Killian. The lack of including S.H.I.E.L.D or the Avengers was also an ill advised decision made by the newly appointed director Shane Black who you may remember from predator or the end credits from the lethal weapon films. I would suggest seeing this movie if you have already seen: Place beyond the pines, 42, Oblivion, and Pain and gain. Which are all far better films, but If you must see Iron man 3 immediately, see it cheap. Because otherwise you will be upset for spending more then about 10 dollars on this film. Robert Downey jr. gives another strong performance as Tony Stark, and made me decide to give this movie a seven instead of five. Don't expect to see much of the main man in his metal suit though. Except during the last action scene which is very redeeming, and seems to have made most reviewers forget about the films flaws. Like I said this film is okay, but there are far better films out right now, and this one just isn't worth the ticket price.

Mandarin? Where did that come from? Writers, you need to stick to your sources. This was not a genius plot twist. Now someones got to work real freaken hard to explain that one off. In fact don't. Just pretend that effing up the Mandarin and War Machine didn't even happen. - The suits can fit on anybody Tony wishes, but not Rhodes when he really needs one. - The other ""Extremists"" can die to their death when falling from 200ft into fire and explosions, but not Pepper. - Anxiety attacks were not needed. - The boy side kick thing was not needed. - The fan in the van was not needed. - Really Happy, you don't know how to flip an iPad screen over? - Some suits were cool, some were just plain dumb.

","Lot of you might hate me for writing this review. But I have been a reader of Iron Man comics since I was in kindergarten (almost 30 years). So in a sense there would probably no bigger Iron Man fan-boy than me. I wondered if it bothered anyone else that the president looked like a chubby Mitt Romney? Does this mean that the makers of Iron Man 3 (or Disney) was making a political statement that they think Mitt should have won? Then again this is a make believe fantasy world and the resemblance could have been coincidental. I kind of groaned after the falling out of Air Force One scene. Honestly they would have splattered on impact of the water or the people at the top should have had their arms rip out of their sockets or at least severely dislocated. At the very least they should have had massive internal injuries and internal bleeding from the impact with the water because they did not slow down that much. Then again this is comic book physics which does not really apply to the real world physics. My next biggest complaint Rhodie should have had more Iron Patriot fight scenes. I'm not going to bother explaining that the Iron Patriot in the comics was actually Norman Osborn in the comics during the Civil War story line. I don't think he even fired that big gun on his shoulder. They kind of nerfed Rhodie as a character. They kind of turned him into the token black character that is just there. Would have been nice if they had some back story on how Tony and Rhodie became friends. If I remember right he only had like 5 or 10 lines of dialog. My final complaint they turned the Mandarin who is probably Iron Man's greatest enemy into a goofy more pathetic version of Shredder from the later seasons of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles from the 90s. That was almost unforgivable, but.... I see what they were trying to do. The whole 10 alien power rings might not have been in the budget. I was really hoping that the ring that the guy from the 10 rings was wearing in the first Iron Man was one of the Mandarin's and he was influencing him through it. I think they were trying to do a gamble and do something different. Something no one was expecting. Honestly they could have casted Russell Brand for the part of the Mandarin and it would have produced the same results only I think that he would have matched that character a little better.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

","Before watching this movie, I had heard that it was the worst one out of all of them. However, I liked it. It was always going to be different with Shane Black coming in for Jon Favreau but I thought it worked quite well. I thought the balance between the ingenious wit and at times seriousness of Tony Stark was spot on. Although some may disagree, I loved what they did with the Mandarin. It's something different, something that you don't expect. That sums up Iron Man in general. You don't see many films doing that sort of thing. Completely tearing up the comic lore and going with something completely different. I liked it and I respect them for doing that. OK, there were areas where I thought could've been better. I expected Pepper to have a more prominent role in the film as I thought that would've worked well, following on from the Avengers. It would've also been nice to see Aldrich Killian's background been explored more as this would've added to what is already a great film. It was never going to be a 'one of the best of all time' films but I really enjoyed it and felt that although it was different, it kind of worked.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

","Iron Man 3 is the final instalment of the Iron Man trilogy and in general, a decently crafted film, from a non-marvel fan perspective but proved itself at the box office and became the most popular film out of the series: making over 1 billion dollars. After watching both Iron man and the sequel, I didn't know what to expect from the third and what more they could add to it, non the less the idea of a third film got me very excited. It features all of the actors playing main characters from the previous films such as Robert Downey Jr as 'Tony Stark', Gwenyth Paltrow as 'Pepper Pots' e.c.t. In general, it was a film of high expectations to the world and all marvel fans particularly. It took a different approach to the other Iron Man films, taking to the idea of a thought to be huge terrorist threat, acted by Ben Kingsley to in fact a drunken, idiotic actor just as the distraction, which replaced the typical huge marvel villain of the film. Personally, I thought it was enjoyable, thrilling but also funny which from the presence of Robert Downey Jr, humour was beforehand expected in the film. I wasn't very impressed with the idea of the villain as I felt the Mandarin in the film had little meaning and took the traditional 'marvel story' out of the equation. Moving on to the action side of the film, as you would expect in a Marvel production the action scenes were both explosive and high paced, edging you further and further off of your seat the longer it went on. Next, the main character which makes the film what it is, Tony Stark played by Robert Downey Jr, once again his role as Iron Man brings the edge of humour and brings another outstanding performance, his classy one liners never fail to impress however throughout the film, he is never really in the Iron Man suit, which in my eyes is a big disappointment as the action in the Iron Man suit is what I look forward too. Some of the audience would agree with me when I see you pay to see the suit. Another issue I had with the film is the fact that a majority of the characters just vanish at certain moments in the film, for example the kid that name no one actually remembers is introduced towards the middle of the film, 15 minutes later he doesn't appear again until right at the end. This also outlines the Disney side of the film involving a child that actually saves Tony's life at one point, but that isn't very important. Besides these small problems, I thought it was funny, action packed and a very enjoyable film. In conclusion I felt this film was extremely good, a tad confusing because of the story line, but in as a whole, a really enjoyable production. Unless you are a die-hard Marvel fan this film should be to your expectations of an action film. I fully recommend this film to anyone who liked either the first or second, or any of Marvels films for that matter.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

1368,4 May 2013,jta6207,8," A Mechanic. A Twist. A Surgery.
","This movie is not perfect, but none are. It is very enjoyable though. I would like to add a few things before I start this review. I am a comic movie fan, I have always know about Iron Man and I would think 90% of comic book characters. Besides some of the Civil War storyline and some older Spiderman and X-Men comics I have not read many others. I did grow up with most of the Marvel TV shows that were on in the 90's though. I have seen most of the motion comics that have been made over the past few years. I did see Extremis so I knew the general storyline that was going into this movie. I honestly don't know why people get so upset that comic book movies don't follow the comic arcs that they are based on 100% how they were written. If you wanted something 100% the same as the comic arc why would you waste your money on a movie? The producers, writers and directors of these movies want to make the story their own based off of the base material the comics that are offered and make it their own story. The first Iron Man is the best in my opinion. From what I have seen on other reviews and the message boards this seems to be true for the most part. This movie is the second best in the trilogy in my opinion, hopefully though it will expand off of this and go into more SOLO Iron Man movies. I understand that at least Tony Stark will be in The Avengers 2 from the end credits of this movie. The movie opened in a way that was very different than the rest of the marvel movies of late. I personally like the Marvel logo with the pages fluttering but it's not a problem. It opened with a conference from back in 1999 on New Year's Eve that introduced Killian and Maya, as well as Happy with a nice 90's mullet. So in the first few minutes we are introduced to most of the key players of the movie, AIM, and the idea of Extremis. It was a very fast paced movie, a lot of what you see in the trailers happened in the first 30 minutes to an hour into the film. Yes there were some plot holes but no movie is without some. If you're going to see Iron Man to diagnose every little thing that is either not cannon with the comics, or not 100% scientifically accurate you are wasting you time. It's a story that been created from the comics for us to spend our money and enjoy. Or watch online like some people do which is not a good idea. The Twist did not bother me, they had a reasonable explanation for it, it wasn't terribly forced, and it was fairly simple. I have seen many reviews comparing it tooSPOILER AHEADBatman Begins. I can see the comparison but it is not really like Batman Begins completely. Yes it was the leader pretending to be someone else with someone else pretending to be the leader. The big difference being in Batman no one other than Batman knew who the leader was. Whereas in Iron Man, The Mandarin is out there for the public to see, know, and fear. The Mandarin was a product of the think tank that was AIM. It made sense when you thought about it, it was so simple anyone could understand and it helped move the story along. Getting to see all of the new suits is something that I think every fan of this series has been waiting for. I've personally wanted to see a Hulk-Buster suit. There were a lot of them that came at the end and he maybe wears five of them. But you never get to see what they can fully do or what makes them different from each other. One thing that I don't like that's not a huge problem is that fact that the War Machine suit was designed by Hammer in IM2 and the Iron Patriot by AIM in IM3. I also would've liked to have seen Hammer, known what was going on with him or something. He was an interesting, funny, bad guy, hopefully not forgotten in future films. I liked the end scene because I really loved the chemistry the two actors have in The Avengers and in Zodiac and in both movies there chemistry is completely different. I did feel though where Maya said Tony used to talk about space exploration and Guardians of the Galaxy is coming up that maybe the end scene should've been him flying into space. Or it could've been like the end of Iron Man 1 or 2 where they introduced the idea of the Avengers and Thor, So Wasp or Ant-Man would've made sense but the scene was fun and clever. Some things I would like to see added to the Marvel Universe would have to be Black Panther, War Machine/Iron Patriot standalone film(s), more SHIELDpossible Redford takeoverand definitely more Stark and Banner together as well as a Hulk movie with Ruffalo. I do feel like if this is the end as RDJ as Iron Man that Don Cheedle will either become Iron Man, be War Machine/Iron Patriot, or be a backup character. The surgery does not suggest that he is not Iron Man anymore, because somewhat alike to Batman, Iron Man is a symbol. As well as the fact that Rhodey, Pepper and a couple other people use suits without the reactors in THEM, but rather in the suit. So now he is no longer in danger but can rather chooses to stay Iron Man because HE IS Iron Man. Overall a very good movie, good action, a lot of comedy, very entertaining, making you want to see Thor, Captain America and The Avengers 2.

The plot does tend to slip in places but this shouldn't stop the enjoyment of the film, if this is the beginning of Marvels Phase 2 then we are all in for one hell of a ride up to The Avengers 2. My only hope is Mr Downey signs a new deal soon because there is nobody else on the planet who can play Tony Stark, this is the part he was born to play and nobody can do it better.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

","how much powerful is the villain ,hero always win ,But there should be some logic behind this either the hero is so intelligent or he is using latest tech. There are many scenes in this film which I did not understand one is, Hero fall from the sky ,his suit remain unbroken even his bones:-) but at this point I am concerned with suit only but at the near-end when hero was not in the suit and iron suit hit with the truck ,suit broken into pieces..what a good movie.. What a big coincidence that when hero fall ,he fall thousands of miles away (as tony said ) , IN THE SAME CITY where chad davis used to live ....whats this ..:-@",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

","Thought it was a very good movie. Sometimes when you get to part 3 things start to get stale. Not so here. A great villain and an even better story line. Can't wait to see what Marvel has in store for us next. My son and I have not missed one. We almost missed this one, didn't get to see the 3-d version, but we made it and the theater was still packed. So many ways you can go. Looking for the cameo was fun as always. I missed it but my boy did not. We checked and he was right. I agreed not to write a spoiler. I don't think saying Stan Lee made a cameo is a spoiler as he always does. Can't wait to see where Tony Stark goes from here.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

","This is the best movie I have ever seen in my life. It's the movie with Iron Man (Tony Stark) is at his best. He's forced to think like a genius throughout the movie in order to keep himself alive. The way he does it is amazing. As for all the other actors, they did a great job in their roles, especially the Iron Man's robot helper. It was always something that Iron Man could talk to. Throughout the entire movie I was deeply inside the world of Iron Man. After the movie I was still in it. I couldn't stop thinking about it. Overall, the movie was beyond what my words can describe. It's a MUST SEE for any smart individual that's out there. You won't regret it.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

","This movie wasn't meant to follow the marvel universe storyline. It is hidden and riddled with in your face. A false mandarin is like telling you Osama Bin Ladin is not the true mastermind behind 911. The links to the mastermind points back to the white-house in the movie, so the movie is sorta telling you that. It also hints that you should research Wernher Von Braun and you will find his warnings to his assistant Carol Rosin about the false alien Invasion threat to be used as excuse to weaponize space. Let's face it, 9 out of 10 people are going to compare the Mandarin to Osama. By such simple correlation, you must be daft not to see that the movie is trying to tell you who the real 911 culprits are.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013
1434,3 June 2013,dom02,7," Amazing movie but not perfect...
","Iron Man 3 was a movie I was EXTREMELY looking forward to. The trailers were amazing and The Avengers was really awesome! This movie lived up to my expectations but was it perfect? Well short answer no, but it is very close to perfect. The acting was amazing from all of the cast. Robert Downey Jr will always be the best Iron Man! Don Cheatle, Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce and Gwyneth Paltrow were also amazing. The special effects were great and the action was really awesome. There was a certain twist that ruined the movie for some people but not for me :) The only problem I had with the movie was that I thought the whole Extremis plot could have been scrapped. It served not much to the story. Another small issue was that I wish Ben Kingsley would be in it more :( But overall it is very amazing and I think older children will LOVE it!",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

Love RDJ he is really good and performs better in this iron man than the first two, Iron man 3 is better than Iron man 2 but not better than the first.

","I was actually happy with the film during the beginning half of it. It did a good job of tying into The Avengers and blending the Extremis arc with The Mandarin. There were some details I didn't enjoy, like how they turned War Machine into Iron Patriot (who is Norman Osbourne in the comics), or Aldrich Killian being alive (who is dead and has a smaller role in the comics). However, these were details I felt were minor enough to forgive because the story was initially progressing in a good direction. However, once they revealed The Mandarin's secret, everything took a turn for the worse. ",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

","I know this is a fictitious movie, but I mostly had a problem with the realism in Iron Man 3. I really didn't like how his pieces of armor could fly onto Tony Stark, or that he could just jump into a suit in two seconds. I suspended my disbelief with the Iron Man movies when Tony Stark comes to a sudden stop while in his armor without getting a concussion or something, but that's as much as I can handle. These movies were pretty good at staying believable and realistic for the most part, but it's not getting better.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013
1440,5 May 2013,tcsimmon,7," Disappointing, but still entertaining.
","A quick way to sum up this movie is this: a disappointing final act of a groundbreaking trilogy that is still entertaining enough to warrant multiple viewings. Shane Black's entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a fun and exciting ride that never really builds up to the promises it makes. However, it does do a good job in using the rest of the MCU, especially The Avengers, in creating the emotional storyline that Tony Stark follows throughout the film.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013

","Here we have another superhero trilogy find its end. After seeing The Dark Knight Rises last year it left some impressions on me. In my opinion that was the best batman movie out of the latest ones and it being the third one I expected the same out of Iron Man 3. I'm not saying its a bad movie but it missed out on some key factors that would make it a great movie. The writing was decent with the exception that the outcome of most battles were determined by a conveniently placed object, weapon, etc. Robert Downey Jr.'s acting was pretty good but a couple of the minor roles were off. Maya Hansen didn't do as good of a job as I had hoped and Gwyneth Paltrow overdid it a bit in the end. The movie did have some good points though. For example some of the story didn't exactly follow DC's original comic version-such as the Mandarin and Iron Patriot - but it was written into the plot well enough to make die hard DC fans love it. Despite the bad things said about the movie I did enjoy watching it. I highly recommend any fan of comic books, superheroes or movies in general to go see it.",/review/rw2852689/?ref_=tt_urv,Iron_Man_3_(2013
