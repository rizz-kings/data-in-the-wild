","I'll be honest - Marvel movies are not in my top 20 or even 50 but within the Marvel ""Universe"" I would say that Shang-Chi is in my top 5. I know, it's blasphemy and all that but think about it - is it better than Iron Man? I would admit yes - it's origin story is arguably better, and it's characters are a lot deeper. The Mandarin is a conflicted man, with evil but good as well, like real life. Is this movie better than The Avengers or Ragnarok or Infinity Wars? Hard to say, which means it's right up there with the best (of Marvel) in my opinion.",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

","The story was riddled with holes and plot issues. Since when does Awkwafina's pedestrian character all of a sudden get invited to become part of the MCU team? What's her super power... stupidity? Don't get me wrong, I love her, but her character was lazily written. Then there's the whole daddy issues dynamic - Shang is with him, then against, then with etc.. Then we have these ridiculous dragons fighting, where one scores some power crystals and becomes stronger! This is just infantile lazy writing. There was zero shock value or anything spectacular in the entire runtime, with tedious long middle acts and a bumbling third act. The jokes were cliched and not funny. The funniest parts were Ben Kingsley's character, (of whom was in this for what reasons??) and the ending to go Karaoke - which was the only time I actually cracked a chuckle. You'd think with three writers we'd have something cohesive and coherent. But instead of a Marvel superhero story, we got a Disney evil vs good with dragons thrown into the mix.

","Destin Daniel Cretton's 'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' marks a bland start to the new phase of Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is a spectacle with regards to action sequence and fighting choreography, but the film misses a solid storyline for an origin story as its titular character lacks personality and does not go through any heroic transformation story arc.

The backstory with the father and the mother was a nice wuxia inspiration and a cool way of introducing the Chinese theme to Marvel. The protagonist and Awkwafina had a believable friendship that struggled to balance enjoyment with living up to expectations. The tensed family relationship was a great focus as the father's gravity and charisma almost matched that of Thanos and feels like a truly deep human being.

","This was just a lot of fun. The story wasn't as tight as it could have been, but I found myself enjoying the whole movie regardless. The fight choreography was bangin', and all the action was just very well directed. Everything felt purposeful and exhilarating. The beginning of the movie feels like a straight-up martial arts movie and then as it progresses we get more and more fantasy elements working their way in which felt like a nice contrast. The music definitely felt like it added a lot here. I kept being reminded of how mixing different elements in with the more traditional orchestrated sounds really worked for Black Panther's soundtrack, and I honestly think this film did it even better.

I felt the movie was incredibly dull, generic, utterly cliched and stereotyped. Crap characters, formulaic plot, and not even all that funny. As soon as the movie opened with a Chinese battle banner and the twang of guzheng notes, I knew it would be bad. The action and fight scenes aren't even all that great: they relied way too much on CG. I feel like the action was nothing special: Jackie Chan (and Yuen Wah whom you'll see in Shang Chi) in his hey-day produced way better action and fights without CG. Back when The Matrix first came out, that was mind-blowing action that Western audiences haven't seen before. If you've seen any number of Hong Kong martial arts movies you'll know what I mean. The third act of the movie was a total rip-off of the last battle in How to Train Your Dragon.

","The movie was entertaining to some degree and followed the standard Marvel Universe formula. Trite, current day pop cultural references and jokes during the first half of the movie were cheap and certainly will be lost on audiences of the future. A few idiots in the theatre guffawed loudly at most of them. As usual, though, the women were strong, kind and intelligent and the men were dumb and evil. Are we to believe that the most evil man in the Universe, Xi, is going to change his evil ways and that his wife would have even married a mass murderer on the scale of Genghis Kahn or Vlad the Impaler? Of course she's killed by his enemies and he returns to a life of evil and sends his henchmen to kill his own children to retrieve some necklaces so he can read a map. I will say Xi was a badass, as were Shang's sister, Aunt, and pretty much every other character compared to Shang, who was soft and definitely not superhero material. Awkwafina was funny and entertaining as usual, overshadowing Shang in most scenes as his character was so forgettably boring. Even his Aunt could kick his butt. Loved Ben Kingsley as the Mandarin, extremely funny and his performance was genius. The outcome was the usual for Marvel Universe and even the pre-view for the next movie during the credits was lame; I guess they could only get Mark Ruffalo and Brie Larson, perhaps the only two Marvel Universe characters lamer than Shang, to set up the next movie.",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

Much fighting ensues but fortunately everyone eventually learns how to 'get along' when faced with a real threat. You have seen it all before: physics-defying martial arts, monsters who look like the recently swallowed strings of LED Christmas lights, conflicted heroes with wise-cracking 'comic relief' sidekicks (an awful Aquafina and an even more awful Ben Kingsley), giant melees featuring a variety of glowing weapons (but no blood), hyper-kinetic and hyper-implausible car/motorcycle chases, and a lot of clichéd wisecracks, tough-guy dialogue, poseur slo-mo, and heroic vogueing (we're treated to the venerable three-point power landing/slide a number of times). The only novel thing the film has to offer is the excellent rendering of mythological beasts from Chinese culture; otherwise, it's an overly-long (132 minutes, which is 120 minutes too much Aquafina), derivative, repetitive, and ultimately boring entry in the bloated, jejune Micky Mouse-Marvel superhero franchise.",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

","Shang-Chi is another bad and boring addition to Marvel's weakest Phase in the MCU (Phase 4). It made less money at the worldwide box office than Godzilla versus Kong in the same ""pandemic era."" The lead actor is boring in the film and pretentious outside the film...mocking fans, berating any constructive or genuine criticism, and spouting a bunch of foolishness on his social media that may get him canceled in the near future by one of the many angry Twittermobs. He basically is the male Brie Larson of the MCU. What could have been an action-packed, fun, exciting Kung Fu film in the MCU collapsed into a lame CGI-fest in the third act--think of the Dragon Ball Z or Avatar films that bombed at the box office. Once again, we had an overpaced origin story...watching Shang-Chi go from being an insecure valet, to getting kicked in the balls by his sister while shirtless in a cage fight with her...despite him being the ""Master of Kung Fu,"" only then to ""saving the universe"" in the third act...all in his first film...while also confronting his feelings and emotional issues with his father. He learns how to use the Ten Rings in a matter of minutes without any learning curve, which is ridiculous, and duels an evil dragon with his own good dragon. The rings aren't even the Mandarin's rings from the comics, but rather ten mystical bracelets. The supporting cast is forgettable, and the jokes are dryer than cracker-juice. Even Michelle Yeoh's star power is wasted and forgotten--most people don't even know she's in this film, which is a shame as she has helped pave the way for these lead and supporting actors and actresses in the film. The supporting actress Awkwafina feels outdated already, even though she just seems to be breaking onto the film scene as ""Marvel's Katy."" There is very bad chemistry between Shang-Chi and Marvel's Katy...what could've been a romance with a different, more competent actor/actress pairing and writer was more of the ""friend-zone"" at best. You definitely don't root for these two to fall in love and wonder if they even would. No chemistry, no tension...fully neutered...or possibly closeted (for now) to pander to a Chinese audience whose government wouldn't show the film in spite of pandering to them. Finally, Shang-Chi's sister is the real master of Kung Fu because she managed to become a better fighter than him, start an entire fight club in another country, all by watching him train and fight with Kung Fu masters while the patriarchy in her culture prevented her from studying martial arts with her brother.

But then it has Ben Kingsley who was out of place in it and a furry creature called Morris that was stupid and unnecessary and should have been ommitted from the movie. It's like a furry pig with wings with no head or face that makes sounds like an Ewok or Gizmo from Gremlins. So dumb. There are some amusing moments but then I find it irritating that something funny has to be thrown in at odd moments. Like most Marvel films. Give it a break. Please.

111,22 December 2021,charbelelaro,5," Easily the worst aspect of the movie is the writing
","Shang-Chi and the Legend of The Ten Rings is directed by Destin Daniel Cretton. The movie centres around the Ten Rings Organisation, which is lead by Shang-Chi's father, who is a man that has been consumed by power and greed for thousands of years. This movie received so much praise, with many claiming this is one of the best instalments in the MCU. However after seeing the film, I have to say I was extremely disappointed. Easily the worst aspect of the movie is the writing. Almost every plot point occurs for no reason but to simply give the audience a purposeless action sequence or provide an exposition dump. To give an example, Shang-Chi's father sends his men to fight his children and we don't have any idea why. The action is cool to look at, and after three lengthy sequences it turns out he just wants them to return to his organisation. We find this out because the father shows up after all the pointless fights, and they just willingly go with him. Couldn't he have just shown up at the start of the movie? Like that would have been way more efficient for him. Basically the entire movie follows this trend. Even the fact that he wants his kid's help makes no sense. He didn't actually need them. He has the ten rings and an entire army to fight with. Like I get he needed their pendants to reveal a confusing useless map for 3 seconds, but couldn't he have taken the necklaces then left them alone? All this is really unfortunate because the execution of some action sequences are so great. Like Shang-chi's fight with his sister. I love hand to hand combat. But there was no purpose behind the fight. It's like someone just put the scene in because the movie got boring. Unfortunately, the movie does not end on a high either. I sat there having to stare at awful green screen and so much CGI, I couldn't help but laugh at it. Overall I thought this movie was watchable but extremely disappointing. There was potential to make a great film here, but to me it felt like marvel did not care about the script.",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

161,19 September 2021,jboothmillard,6," Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings
","The Marvel Cinematic Universe made a big impact with an almost all-black cast in Black Panther, then this film came along and gave the world its first high-profile Asian superhero, and from the trailer I saw, it looked very exciting. Basically, thousands of years ago, Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung) discovered ten mystical iron rings, granting its user immortality and other great powers. He establishes the Ten Rings organisation and throughout history conquers kingdoms and topples governments. In 1996, wanting to expand his power, Wenwu goes in search for Ta Lo, a mystical heavenly realm inhabited by Chinese mythological creatures. He travels through a magical forest to the Ta Lo village entrance but is stopped by guardian Ying Li (Fala Chen). The two fall in love, but Li leaves with Wenwu when he is rejected by the villagers. Wenwu abandons the Ten Rings, and they have two children, Shang-Chi and Xialing. When Shang-Chi is seven years old (Jayden Zhang), Li is murdered by Wenwu's enemies, the Iron Gang. Wenwu once again wields the rings to massacre the Iron Gang, resumes leadership of his organisation, and has Shang-Chi go through brutal training in martial arts. Xialing from childhood (Elodie Fong) secretly copies this training. When Shang-Chi is fourteen (Arnold Sun), Wenwu sends him to assassinate the leader of the Iron Gang. But Shang-Chi is demoralised after fulfilling his mission and decides to run away to America, settling in San Francisco and changing his name to ""Shaun"". In the present day, Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) works as a valet with his best friend Katy (Awkwafina), who knows nothing about his past. They are attacked on a bus by the Ten Rings, led by high-ranking agent Razor Fist (Florian ""Big Nasty"" Munteanu) who steal a pendant that Shang-Chi was given by his mother. Wenwu anonymously provides Shang-Chi with the location of his sister and, fearing that the Ten Rings will go after Xialing's matching pendant from their mother, Shang-Chi decides to meet her. He reveals his past to Katy, who insists on helping him. They find Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) at an underground fight club in Macau, which she founded after escaping from Wenwu. The Ten Rings attack the fight club and Wenwu arrives to capture Shang-Chi, Katy, Xialing, and her pendant. They are taken to the Ten Rings' compound, where Wenwu uses the pendants to reveal a magical map leading to Ta Lo. Wenwu explains that he has heard Li calling to him and believes she is alive and being held captive in Ta Lo behind a sealed gate. He plans to destroy the village unless they release her. When Shang-Chi, Xialing and Katy object, Wenwu imprisons them. Also incarcerated is former actor Trevor Slattery (Sir Ben Kingsley), whom the Ten Rings imprisoned for impersonating Wenwu, as The Mandarin, and his hundun companion Morris, who offers to guide them to Ta Lo. The group escapes and travel to Ta Lo, which exists in a separate dimension with various Chinese mythological creatures. They meet Ying Nan (Michelle Yeoh), Li's sister, who explains the history of Ta Lo: thousands of years ago, the village was attacked by the soul-consuming Dweller-in-Darkness and its minions but was saved by a Chinese dragon called the Great Protector who helped seal the Dark Gate to the Dweller's world. According to Nan, the Dweller-in-Darkness has been influencing Wenwu to believe Li is still alive so that he will open the Gate. Shang-Chi, Xialing, and Katy join the villagers in training and preparing for Wenwu's arrival, using outfits and weapons crafted from dragon scales. Wenwu and the Ten Rings arrive and attack. Wenwu overpowers Shang-Chi and forces him into the nearby lake, then destroys the Gate with the rings. Some of Dweller's minions escape, and the villagers join forces with the Ten Rings to fight them. Shang-Chi is revived by the Great Protector, which leaves the lake to battle the minions. Wenwu and Shang-Chi fight once more, with Shang-Chi gaining the upper hand, but he chooses to spare his father. The Dweller-in-Darkness escapes the weakened Gate and attacks Shang-Chi. Wenwu saves his son, bequeathing him the rings before being killed by the Dweller-in-Darkness. The Dweller-in-Darkness is eventually killed by the combined efforts of Shang-Chi, the Great Protector, Xialing, and Katy. Following the battle, Shang-Chi and Katy return to San Francisco where they are summoned by the sorcerer Wong (Benedict Wong) to the Sanctum Sanctorum. In a mid-credits scene, Wong introduces Shang-Chi and Katy to Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) and Carol Danvers (Brie Larson). They discover that the ten rings are emitting a mysterious signal. In a post-credits scene, Xialing becomes the new leader of the Ten Rings after telling Shang-Chi that she was going to disband the organisation. Also starring Ronny Chieng as Jon Jon, Tsai Chin as Waipo, Yuen Wah as Master Guang Bo, Jodi Long as Mrs. Chen, Dallas Liu as Ruihua, Paul He as Chancellor Hui and Tsai Chin as Katy's grandmother, with the voice of Tim Roth as Abomination. Liu is suited nicely as the lead hero, Awkwafina is loveable as the hero's high-spirited best friend, Leung is interesting as the half-hero half-villain father, and there is good support from the likes of Yeoh and Kingsley. It is a simple story of a young man who must confront his past and use his mastery in weaponry-based Kung Fu to save the world, the highlights are the fight on the speeding bus and the final epic battle featuring dragons and mythical monsters, I agree the excellent special effects may swamp a lot of what is going on, but a well-written script, many fast-paces sequences, moments of humour, and nods to past martial arts movies help to smooth things out, all together it is an entertaining superhero fantasy action. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. Good!",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

For the amount of money put into a film like this I would hope the effects would be better than an episode of Game of Thrones, but instead they looked like the Matrix part 2. All of the actors involved were fantastic - when it was actually them, not a CGI stand in, but the story was all over the place, the villain(?) made no sense, I honestly have no idea what the hell was going on in the last half hour compared to the first hour.

Only thing I ask of Marvel/Disney is somehow bring Tony Leung back. And maybe help the general public on how to properly pronounce Shang Chi. (Sh-on-Chi).

In the beginning of marvel women (in my opinion) were displayed as either a strong power woman or a sex object. Here the women are just themselfs. The storyline is something new for me, I never heard about these stories and legends before. But now I plan to do that way more often. It was a little disappointing that all the 'good' main characters survived without a scratch. Of course I am happy that they will return in these movies in the future, but it makes it less dramatic and realistic.

","Marvel Studios has gained a glamorous reputation throughout the last decade, and this film was a huge milestone for superhero cinema, Asian representation, and the studio as a whole. Like Black Panther was to a lot of African-American audiences, Shang-Chi will ignite a spark in the hearts of Asians. This film opens the door to a relatable character and I love Simu-Liu's portrayal of Shang-Chi. I have watched Simu previously in the show Kim's Convenience as a comedic character and there couldn't have been better casting for Shang-Chi. Simu reflects the combination of an Asian-American character superbly and has an amazing screen presence. His character reminded me of Captain America because of his leadership role in the film, standing up against all odds, and overall amazing chemistry with the rest of the cast. Awkwafina's character, Katie, was an amazing character, filled with comedic relief that gave a lighter tone, to a film that was a little bit too dark for a Marvel film. Tony Leung's character, The Mandarin stole the show with a vengeance. Tony Leung is absolutely ground-breaking in every role he plays and The Mandarin was a unique role he took on. Leung had an amazing screen presence and was my character in the film. The visual effects in the film were unique and I could see that the animators had taken inspiration from traditional Chinese films regarding Martial Arts, also having similarities in design to Doctor Strange. The action in this film was mind-blowing like I was expecting, and I loved the fight on the bus. The soundtrack was average, with the usage of traditional Chinese instruments. The songs used in the film were composed by primarily Chinese Hip-Hop artists and I enjoyed them. The writing in this film was good, but not great. One of the criticisms I have about the film is that the plot did not feel original and could've been executed far better. There were a lot of parts in the middle of the film that stole away from the central plot of the film. This film had a more emphasis on magic and fantasy as suppose Kung Fu. Overall, this film is hands down one of the best gems Marvel has produced, and I cannot wait for Shang-Chi to integrate with the Marvel Cinematic Universe further.",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

The second problem is the fact that Shang-Chi itself is not an interesting character as far as this movie treats him.

Aside from the tired storylines which have become common in these Marvel films, the ending was a little over the top. Aside from these criticisms, I'll give kudos to a good cast and wonderful cinematography. If I ever get a faithful adaption of a Marvel comic I grew up with, I might be shocked.

But there's a lot of good things Shang-Chi does that differentiates this film from the normal MCU film. The Visuals are breathtakingly beautiful and unlike any MCU film I have seen. The tone of the film resembles Chinese Action Movies more rather than MCU which is so refreshing. The first few fight scenes are just incredible and got me super hyped but the quality falls in the later scenes when it becomes a CGI Monsterfest. The story is very predictable and full of narration and exposition. At its core its a very emotional family drama but the dialogues are not powerful enough to dig really deep and I craved for that in so many scenes. The performances are solid with Awkwafina and Ben Kingsley providing great Comedic Relief, but the standout is Tony Leung. He generates such level of empathy and emotional suffering with just his eyes, He is the Legend after all.

I believe that the great Ben Kingsley has the right idea about appearing in these so-called Marvel Cinematic Universe movies: his character is self-deprecating and patently absurd. In this, the first all-Asian superhero film, he's just incidental as the real comic-relief is provided by hilarious Awkwafina. And some good acting is provided by titular newcomer Simu Liu and especially by Tony Leung Chiu-wai portraying his father. And of course, Michelle Yeoh is always entertaining.

He was and artist on the series from issue 76-120 and co-created the character of Death Dealer who features in this movie. I had high expectations for this film because of my family connection and it didn't disappoint. Stunning visuals and exciting stunts elevate this film. While there are chanes from the original comics, these changes make sense and still fit within the overall scheme of the Marvel universe.

MCU with a touch of Jackie Chan's ""Police Story"" series with some elements of wire fu that you can find in 2000's ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" and 2002's ""Hero"", because, you know, all of those ancient China settings. It's pretty intense at first, gets a little boring in the middle, then becomes action-packed again by the third act, though it's going a little bit too rushed. The CGI is pretty standard, MCU standard, which means good, not great, not terrible. Love Simu, he really looks like he's having fun with the role he's given; Awkwafina's character isn't as annoying as I had thought it would be; and as usual, like I've been saying about the MCU: some of the jokes are cringey or don't land very good at best, but it's just me tho, I don't know about you guys, maybe you'll find it funny you'd laugh your ass off, or just smile a little, who knows?

The actors did a great job, the cinematography was great and CGI was spot on. The only complaint is that the movie felt very cringe ish at some times, especially during the first 10 minutes. But the movie gradually got better, still having some cringey scenes during the run. I know some people have their complaints on Awkwafina but she really did a great job. Simu Liu's character was lacking at times though but I'd definitely say he has one of the best debut characters in terms of personality.",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

Along the way, unknown properties like Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man came out of nowhere as well but were welcomed with open arms. I was really hoping that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings would follow in those footsteps, and it more than does. With rich world-building, a great cast, and the use of mythology, this is one of my favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe entries to date. Over time I may even come to appreciate it even more.

The entire movie is shooted in closed studio environment with huge set pieces (Marvel is doing such things for last many movies e.g, the last 2 Avengers movies). It is very very very stupid to look at and the non sensical vfx. Still remember the first Iron man movie in which the original and vfx elements are hard to distinguish and have had a good balance in reality and fantasy world. The movie is forcing the humours too in some cases. In some case they tried to mimic Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. This movie certainly have some asian vibe in movie making style but I think there were manipulation in making by studio over creator. The music of the movie is good. Overall it's a good movie.

498,14 November 2021,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7," The legend of the ten Marvel movies a year for all eternity.
","'Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings (2021)' is, essentially, exactly what you expect it to be. Not only does it feel like a Marvel movie, it feels like a literal Disney movie as well. This is often detrimental to the overall affair, as the piece should have been much more unique than it ultimately is, and it makes for a much less interesting watch overall. However, the formula it follows has provided plenty of success in the past; this time is no exception. Its highs are where you'd expect them to be, as are its lows, and there is an undeniable sense of fun, albeit cookie-cutter fun, to be had. The film is an entertaining action adventure that follows a young man whose criminal father calls him and his sister back home in order to lay siege to the mystical village he believes is holding his wife, the protagonist's mother, hostage. The villain's motivation is a little underexplored yet entirely understandable. It comes from a believable emotional place and is more satisfying because of it. The relationship between the lead and his no-good dad isn't explored as much as it could be, though, and the flick generally has a bit of a theming issue. The piece tries to tie its events directly into the wants and needs of its lead characters, but it does so in an unsatisfyingly half-baked way and honestly would probably have been better if it played itself as more of a straightforward adventure ala most of the 'Mission: Impossible (1996-)' series. Still, the touches of character development are appreciated and each lead player is written to be as likeable as possible. This, combined with the amicable performances, means that you care about the heroes even though you don't have all that much reason to. This keeps you invested in their stories throughout. The highlight of the entire affair is, for sure, its action. For the most part, the picture stays towards the right end of the practical to CG spectrum. The fights are never exactly realistic, per se, but they're based on competent choreography and clean camerawork. They're, more often than not, really entertaining. Sadly, the flick inches closer and closer towards the wrong end of the aforementioned spectrum the longer it goes on. By the time it reaches its finale (which gives me major 'Fast And Furious Presents Hobbs And Shaw (2019)' vibes for some reason), it's clear that the balance it previously achieved is going to go out of the window. Sure enough, its climactic battle is an entirely computer-generated affair; it isn't all that compelling and goes directly against what made the movie so enjoyable to begin with. No matter how hard it tries to disguise it, it still ends with a big blue beam in the sky. Still, the finale isn't exactly bad. It's just annoyingly intangible and feels a little forced in, even (as do the rather cringe-worthy post-credits scenes). Ultimately, this is a generic yet entertaining experience. Its charming acting and exciting action are clearly its highlights, and its weakest aspects are still decent enough. It's a good movie. However, I can't deny that Marvel fatigue is becoming more and more pertinent in my mind. You know what you're going to get before you get it. Plus, the studio's insistence that it has to perforate every single outing with references to other, almost entirely irrelevant fare is really annoying. Although most of their movies are at least okay, I find myself not caring at all about them. That's sad, really, considering that the MCU has produced some genuinely great pictures in the past. 7/10.",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

","Seriously extraordinary cast! All were terrific... it's Simi Liu's movie, but he's lucky to be flanked by incredibly talented actors. Awkwafina kills it. We see a whole new dimension of her acting; she's fun but more subdued and a wonderful love interest. Ben Kingsley's character is hilarious... It would be fun and quirky to see him in sequels. Leung, Yeoh, and Zheng - all A++ performances. It was just a truly solid cast... Not a weak or even marginal performance from any of the cast. Just loved the movie!! It was fun seeing a couple of Avengers (Danvers and Banner) in the final moments. Nice nods to the MCU throughout. The mid-credit scene is awesome and hysterical! Wong is terrific and appears to be setting up sequels and future interactions / crossovers with perhaps Doctor Strange and others. Same for the late-credit scene. It sets up another whole plot trajectory and gives a wonderful hat tip to gender fairness - but in a way you're rooting for. All in all...

Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings has a style and tone that is quite different from others in the franchise, though it shares the sly humour and ability to poke fun at itself that has become characteristic of the MCU. The film nicely shakes off the shackles of Shang-Chi's somewhat questionable comic book origins by making a film that appears to owe more to Chinese culture than the Western one that spawned the comics. The most obvious influence is wuxia, a genre of films that are most likely to be familiar to Western moviegoers lacking any great knowledge of Chinese film, like myself, from examples such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Hero, and House of Flying Daggers.",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

I don't remember Disney and Marvel having a similar family history, and I'll be careful not to disassemble it so as not to accidentally spoil it. We have seen different fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters over the years, and the relationship between many was special. In the case of the Shang-Chi family, the writers found some interesting solutions in the style of Asian ""fathers and sons"". And in general, the leitmotif in the film is the theme of the family, albeit against the backdrop of flying arrows, bo, sai daggers and swords. Incredibly beautifully filmed several romantic scenes that serve to some extent justify the motives of the actions of the main protagonist.

It's the origin story of the title character, a martial arts superhero, but he is not nearly as well known as Spider-Man or Captain America, so we are not treated to yet another iteration of Uncle Ben's demise. Instead we are given a fleshed out story of a tragic family, one without easily defined villains. Shang-Chi joined the Marvel Comic scene in 1973 in an attempt to create a character that could cash in on the Kung Fu craze at the height of Bruce Lee's popularity. He had his own book for many years, interacting with other Marvel heroes, and if he has not been a Marvel regular in recent decades, Shang-Chi has never gone away, and retained the loyalty of many hardcore fans.",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

","One of the real standouts for me in the movie was the fights scenes. The MCU is not really known for having interesting fight scenes and really most of them are just bland and cliché but Shang-Chi brought something new and I loved it. Every single fight scene was so well done and paced super well and Destin Daniel Cretton, who directed this, did an amazing job directing the fight scenes in this movie. The fight scenes in this movie were probably the best part especially since you can tell that all of the actors in this movie, especially Simu Liu, did most of the stunt work themselves. It's also insane to think that other than this movie Simu Liu has only really acted in one other thing but you could barely tell. He played Shang-Chi so well and brought so much emotion that everybody can easily relate to and love him. Honestly, everybody did an amazing job acting in this movie and I have to say I was skeptical with Awkwafina, who plays Katy, but she proved me wrong. But for me, the real scene-stealer was Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, who plays Xu Wenwu, as the villain. The villains in Marvel movies are mediocre at best but he decided to change that with this movie. Xu Wenwu was such an intriguing villain that the audience can easily sympathize with and relate to him. The cinematography in this movie is gorgeous to look at and you can see the detail that was put into it. Depending on where the movie is at the lighting reflects that area. I will say though is that this movie has a bit of slower pacing that at times does work in its favour but in other parts, I very much was wanting the movie to hurry up. In the end, Shang-Chi is such a heartfelt Marvel movie that does have some issues but is still enjoyable.",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

","A simple yet surprisingly decent marvel flick that pays tribute to Chinese culture authentically with Western twists. As an Asian, the most wondrous part of Shang-Chi's cinematic journey is the inclusion of Chinese mythical creatures created with World Class CG. The action scenes are also reminiscent of the top Hong Kong martial arts movies. You have to remember that this is a Marvel Studios movie, so do temper your expectation for the storyline a little, its more style over substance. My biggest gripe is the casting. We've been waiting to see Asian Super Heroes on a global stage, I just find it hard to believe that it is Liu Simu who has very little charisma, and seems way out of his league for this big of a role. Awkwafina provides great comedy relief, and is a fantastic addition to the Marvel Universe, I also find it unfair for the Asian community that she is built to be the love interest.

","Charming and incredibly fun- Shang-Chi may not be the best Marvel has had to offer- but it is one of their better films in some time. My main problems with the film lie in the films storyline, which to be honest, is really good, but incredibly all over the place editing wise and there is just so much of it that it feels like two movies could have been made out of it. I love that we get a more in depth look at our characters, their flaws, their regrets, the tragedy in their lives- but the editing makes it feel rather out of place at times- and takes away from the impact the film could have had and its heart. That being said, the film still manages to be very enjoyable throughout. The action scenes are absolutely incredible, the look of the film incredibly well developed- something very fresh and original for Marvel studios- and the cast are all a joy to watch- especially Simu Liu and Aquafina in the lead and supporting roles. I was skeptical of Aquafina being in a Marvel movie for sure, but she really helped the film as a whole, and honestly I would love to see more of her character in future Marvel projects. The film is entertaining, despite the pacing of the film being a bit all over the place at times. It has some brilliant, elaborate special effects that you will be gawking at on the screen, and plenty of surprises that will be bound to make you smile. In the end, Shang-Chi was a fun time for a Marvel movie- something most comic-book flicks have forgotten about recently- and i'm excited what this character has to offer in future films.",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

","An enjoyable movie and has some witty humor and other familiar aspects from marvel, the execution was done right but was still pretty predictable. There was no blood with slashes and hits which made it really feel like a kid's movie. The premise and plot are great but what that leads the characters to do... is very predictable. When I saw Shang chi exit the elevator into an under ground facility, I already knew he would fight and that it would be his sister. The family dynamic didn't fit right at all, especially the way the family interacted with eachother after what I've seen in the flashbacks. The choreography was spectacular even though some fights made it seem like the 2 characters fight were still going easy on eachother.",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

One of the world's great actors, Leung exerts an effortless majesty. In Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, he plays Wenwu - an immortal who possesses 10 rings with enormous occult power. Wenwu, also known as The Mandarin, heads a criminal organisation called The Ten Rings, which was introduced in the first Iron Man movie. He is a man tormented by an insatiable lust for power, which somehow gets submerged under his love for his wife but then resurfaces after her death as something even more twisted and vicious. Wenwu is one of the more tragic villains in the MCU and Leung plays him with a melancholic charisma that doesn't let up even in the climax as several CGI creatures twist and snarl and prey on everything in their path.

","Honestly, on all levels this movie excels! The casting is perfect. The world building is creative, beautiful and faithful to its Asian roots. The CGI and location shoots are breathtaking. The fighting is the best I've ever seen and even the training ground sequences have an exquisite grace. The action was balanced by heart. I was concerned Awkwafina would take the humour to campy lows but she truly showed she has some serious dramatic chops. She was not the comic relief! They gave that honour to the Shakespearean stage giant, Ben Kingsley, Our own, homegrown 🇨🇦 Simu Liu was perfect for the part and his performance was world class. I could go on raving but I'll conclude my feedback by saying that this is in every way as powerful a MCU solo representation of Asian culture as BLACK PANTHER was for African culture. I gathered some feedback as I left the theatre, and got ratings of 7.5 (felt it needed more MCU content), 8 (saw many of the things I have just commented on). I've read the criticism that the storytelling was choppy, but I didn't find it so. For me it was more like chapters in a book, completely working together to create a world of content and design. Upon leaving the cinema, I was going to give the movie a 9 (superb) out of 10, but after reflecting on it, I don't know what they could have done to make it better, so, I give this film a 10 (perfect) out of 10. {Superhero Action Adventure}",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

","Marvel played it safe with this one and made a standard film about a Chinese-American dude that knows kung-fu. Shang-Chi in this movie is nothing like in the original comics. Very americanized and people-pleasing take on the character. The movie has it's strong points like Tony Leung as the Mandarin. He feels like the only genuinely real character in the movie whom I can relate to. You can feel his every emotion and he is overall the best thing about this movie as so many have said. I actually enjoyed the original Shang-Chi comics because of their deep philosophies and introspective queries, plus the groundbreaking way they mixed action with interesting stories. This movie is lacking in that department. Generic martial arts action we have seen before, boring story for the most part, too many forced jokes and try hard laugh-inducing scenes, and westernization of Chinese culture. All-star Michelle Yeoh makes an appearance in the third act and does her famous tai-chi and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon schtick. Wong also appears and is fun as always. Abomination was in the film for just as long as he was in the trailer. Oh yeah, and Ben Kingsley reappears as Trevor Slattery, the fake Mandarin actor from Iron Man 3 and his story since then is addressed. That little creature he had was annoying rather than the typical cute character they intend to put onto all of these movies. Overall, I expected better, so now I may just wait until the new Spider-Man comes out to go back to the theaters. This was a filler movie that felt rushed.

Until one day a band of assassins targets Shang and it's revealed that he's actually an assassin trained at birth by his father Wenwu(Tony Leung Chiu-Wai). The leader of the ten rings an ancient Chinese organization that's existence for thousands of years, conquering kingdoms and overthrowing governments. Now Shang-Chi must faces his father and overcome the demons of his past. Each of these Marvel films I find most enjoyable is the world building, set up of this universal series. All these characters from various backgrounds and classes and worlds. Shang-Chi I can say is one of those welcome new additions. Similar to Guardians of the galaxy when this was announced I hadn't the slightest idea who this guy was. Usually when people think Martial artists with marvel they usually think Iron fist or daredevil. So going into this I had a blank expectation of what to see. It does pay tribute to old-school martial arts films while mixing fast action charm of a comic book with a blend of Chinese mythology and philosophy. It does helps gives the movie an identity and the characters overall I found them good not great, but I found them entertaining and likable. Shang's more or less just an ordinary guy just trying to live his life. Have fun make a new start and make the best of it. He's honestly more or less happy with his basic life. Though at the same time running from his old life his father,mother and sister. It all leaves an impact on him as a person. He's pretty emotional not Peter Parker emotional, but he still has a personality outside of just having a stoic Shaolin fighter serious persona. They could have easily done a chosen one theme with him that been done to death. He likes to joke and have fun along with his friend Katy. Awkwafina I'm not a fan of her I didn't really care for her in crazy Rich Asians or Raya and the last dragon. Here I found her character more funny and likable. She doesn't really come off as that annoying friend that's more or less in the way. Her and Simu do play well off each other and display this friendship of two different people who still very similar. I got sort of Rush hour vibe off them, there's even a fight scene outside on a bamboo scaffolding. She's not just a pointless tagalong she does have moments where the jokes don't work , though she does add to the film specifically in the finale. The tone of the movie still finds time to flesh them out. More or less the two of them are just goofballs at the beginning, once more's revealed it does take time to have it's more deep serious moments. Wenwu I found to be a really good villain and While technically this still isn't really the Mandarin that comic readers we're probably expecting. His overall character is very compelling he more borders the line like killmonger. You understand his reasons though his actions are unjustifiable. He does still manages to gives off this somewhat opposing demeanor not from his fighting, but from the way he present his self. I buy this guy used to be a tyrant and a Conqueror. I still wish his rings worked the same way though, really he just throws them like chakra and whips them around. As for the sister she's given minimal in this not really alot of moments. Outside of her childhood flash backstory it's clear later down the road their gonna do something her. The visuals are stunning to this one water effect the just pops off the screen. The use of elements being shown through the right use of slow motion. The landscape of Tao lo which has this very traditional Chinese style with Nine-tail foxes, and Fu dog(lions) that make that the rhinos from black panther looks bad. I want to see more places like this in future installments. A lot of these cg effects are on par with doctor strange.",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

","To start off just like I said in my Terminator Dark Fate Review, please pick a Language and go with it don't bounce back and forth in this case English and Mandarin. Because I feel once when you already established that a Character knows how to speak English please stick with that. Because through out the entire film they keep on switching English and Mandarin for each character even after establishing that they know how to speak English. Now don't get me Wrong I have No Hate for Foreign Films by any stretch by the Imagination, it's just in this film in particular they keep on switching back and forth as I've said already that it mind as well be a Hybrid which not is not my Personal Cup Of Tea Personally. Next is and I'm sure that the Actress is a fine actress I'm not hating on her acting skills by any means, it's just that I found the character of Katy really Annoying and bit of a Comedic Relief. Which in my opinion they don't need a Comedic Relief character in the film it's not like it's a Super Dark and Serious Film or anything. Anyways Next is I just Simply wasn't Connected to nether any of the Characters nor the Film itself, in fact I even roll my eyes back in the Sarcastic'Really?' Kind of way on at least two occasions. And I certainly wasn't jumping Up and Down in my seat and Pointing at the Screen while saying ""Oh What Oh No Way MCU Reference MCU Reference MCU Reference......"" like I usually do in an MCU Film when ever they make an MCU Reference to either the MUC as a whole or to just another MCU Film. I got so Disconnected and Bored that I Felt I wasted just over 2 Hours or so of my life, as shout I it off right around the late Second Act to early Third Act Mark I assume. I Turned It Off at the tail end of the Flashback Scene where Xu Wenwu Shun Chi's father beats up those Gangster with his Rings. So much so I literally have zero desire of learning more about the Shun Chi and his World so to speak nor do I care for Shun Chi 2 when and if they decide to make a Sequel to this film, at the moment. And lastly I'm not sure if this is a Good Thing Or Not especially for the MCU but if it wasn't for the MUC References I totally forgot that this was a MCU Film.

Anyways Shang Chi And The Legend Of Ten Rings serves the purpose of entertainment and we can say that Marvel Studios never disappoint us with their movies..",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

There are a lots of nice looking locations and colors in the film, and it has a nice Asian feel to it. There are also great quiet scenes between Shaung and his family.

","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) is a movie my wife and I recently watched at the theatre. The storyline for this movie follows a young man and his best friend who work as parking attendants and are one day attacked by super villains. As they dig into the young man's past they discover his father is behind the attack with the purpose of hopefully brining his family back together. This movie is directed by Destin Daniel Cretton (Just Mercy) and stars Simu Liu (Blood and Water), Tony Chiu-Wai Leung (Infernal Affairs), Ben Kingsley (Iron Man 3), Michelle Yeoh (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) and Awkwafina (Crazy Rich Asians). The storyline for this movie is way better than it should be and has crazy depth around all of the characters. You really understand the what, when and why behind every circumstance and perspective. The acting is outstanding and the characters are perfectly portrayed. The special effects are awesome both in terms of the action scenes and backdrops. The dragons may have been a bit overdone; but other than that, A++++. The choreography was also excellent and seeing Yeoh in this really made me smile.

","Visually stunning and profoundly entertaining.

Visuals are very colourful and well-done, same as its locations and costumes; it also boasts one of the best Marvel fight scenes and choreography (I personally think the best). There is also a balance between the funnier first half and the more serious tone of its second half.

The action scenes here are awesome, although then they are not very frequent. There are a few times when the pace slows down and we wait for some of the fights. Once it does though, you're in for an epic CGI load of fighting that I devoured. There's still the occasional quirk thrown in here and there, as is usually the case with Marvel movies. To sum it up.

The mother and the sister were the strongest characters, yet the mother had to give up her powers when she married this horrible man and the daughter - despite being overlooked all her life mustered up the strength and motivation to become a great fighter.

The performances of Simu Liu and Tony Leung stand out amongst the pack and offer a great and rich story for Marvels Cinematic Universe.

I have seen plenty of Chinese dramas where martial arts is displayed full on & I always found myself thinking the filming direction was a bit off.

","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings: The origin story of Shang Chi, his father Xu Wenwu found the Ten Rings of power 1,000 years ago and trough history has been a conqueror and Robber Baron. In 1996 he found Ta Lo a mystical village, but is beaten by it's guardian. Ying Li. They fall in love and have two children, Shang Li and his sister Xiang. Tragedy strikes and Shang Chi is raised to be an assassin, his sister trains in secret. The story is about Xu wanting his children to join with him in a strange quest but things don't go smoothly. Modern style gin battles and those involving mystical weapons abound, well choreographed as are the martial arts sequnces. One great fight aboard a runaway San Francisco bus on those hills. We also have a Cthuluesque devourer of souls with it's flying minions who battle a Chinese Flying Dragon (he's the good guy). There's also a faceless ""winged wombat"" and other mythological beasts. A great adventure. Directed and Co-Written by Destin Daniel Cretton. 8/10.",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

Still, It's entertaining, visually stunning and it's out of the MCU's pattern which is great. However, I'm not convinced of the Mandarin's motives. It kinda lacks evilness ( ""She"" is his weakness and that's why He's been easily manipulated by a beast and that kinda sucks).

The performances are solid, if not exactly groundbreaking (Michelle Teoh especially has little new to do), and the direction is serviceable. But the whole thing ends in yet another CGI heavy big bass fight that is just... well, way too predictable.

For instance, a 14-year old trained assassin apparently got bullied at school - really?? And WHY was this guy who played a British actor even in the plot? The moment he showed up was the moment I was done with that movie. And then there were the over-the-top magical creatures who probably were supposed to get some ""awwws"" from the female audience. But the most disappointing thing to me was, that the more interesting and more badass sister got treated the way women typically get treated in Hollywood: she got totally ignored.

1080,19 November 2022,tytbbykzkk,5," I've watched this movie 3 times
","I've watched this movie a few times now and I must say, the MCU have lost their ability to fill a scene. I've waited to post a review for years after this release because I noticed it here and in Disneys Mulan, so I wanted to make sure there wasn't some kind of hidden racial bias in my brain. Anyways, both of these movies have no visual cohesiveness between the object of the camera and the background behind them. This method has started to bleed into subsequent films like Thor: love and thunder. It's as if they ran out of budget for extras. These all too Earlthy worlds could have been filmed outside, among nature, instead of a green screen with pre-recorded visuals which the actor must awkwardly stand in front of. The MCU and Disney in general have been throwing us these uncanny valley-esque media presentations, I felt as though I was watching the first draft of a movie and I've continued to feel that way, more frequently, with each consecutive crushed can of cola they release. The standards have dropped significantly, Kevin feigi may no longer be THE guy. His vision for Earths vengeance against its own failures has always been sublime, however as we venture into the cosmos, among beings who can smite a planet, the substance dissolves and becomes a light show. Sexual preference and race designation have become Disney's weapon of choice when tasked to produce a $1 billion movie. Where has morality gone? Why has phase (whatever) been about finding she-hulk a man? Why was falcons/captain America story arc paralleling racial insecurity in the workplace? It was never an issue with same character, plus Rhodes. BP1 was the best with killmongers fascistic sense of superiority, how did it devolve into what it did with F+WS?",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

","This film isn't perfect, I felt like they honestly could have kept it going with the feel of the first half of the film and maybe save the more mystical special effects for a sequel, kind of felt like 2 movies jammed together. But regardless, both halves were great. I think the first half was a bit better and the ending got a bit jumbled with the CGI, but I feel like the more I watch it and am able to process everything the more I'll love it. All I know is I can't wait to watch it again, and I can't wait to see Shang-Chi with the other MCU heroes. Wenwu is one of the best MCU villains so far, maybe the best after Thanos. The humor was fantastic and the bus scene is probably one of the best scenes in the MCU. Choreography was brilliant, cinematography as well. I will say I wish they saved Razor Fist as a future villain (but then we wouldn't have gotten the insane bus scene), and definitely wish they went all out for Death Dealer, or saved him for a sequel as well. I thought he was such a badass character that we only got to see the tip of the iceberg of his potential. Super unique design to him. I do kind of wish Shang-Chi had a superhero name of some sort, kind of throws me off that his Marvel title is just his name, but I guess that's the case for Thor and Loki too. And some of the Netflix heroes if you count them. Anyways I'm really nitpicking now. But great MCU film.

1134,3 September 2021,afrocut,8," Surprisingly good time
","I'm super happy to say that Marvels newest movie outing, ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", is a hilarious, action packed, CGI thrill ride and it's a fantastic one at that. After seeing ""Black Widow"" I was worried that Marvel/Disney had started shifting their focus to their very ambitious TV mini series projects and left the quality of their movies behind. I'm now confident that isn't the case. Here, sets, visuals, costumes, choreography, score, acting and directing are all top notch. Each shot feels fresh and visually stunning. Each joke and emotion land. And the action is amazing. The first big set piece involving Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) and his best friend (awkwafina), is a bus ride to work gone horribly wrong, it hooks you instantly and has you either in awe with its incredible fight choreography or laughing at the perfectly timed jokes. It really doesn't let up in either category going forward. I can't believe how much I loved the pairing of these characters, their choice to not make it romantic and I love how different and real they feel from other characters in the MCU. Often Marvels problem has been their reliance on the same personality traits for their heroes, funny jerks with over confidence or bumbling idiots thrust into power. Here the main character is naturally a good person, hes comfortable with being himself and with his best friend, when power comes to him he accepts, he never truly stops being him, he doesn't have to learn a lesson, he just rolls with the punches. Almost all of this goes to actor Simu Liu who brings an extra dose of likability to the role, along with the chemistry he shares with Awkwafina which makes their friendship believable. There's even great references, cameos and credit scenes for the fans looking for that. Of course there are problems, the biggest is the big CGI slug fest ending that plagues these types of films, when all it truly needed to do was be smaller. It's a mess of CGI at times and feels a little too big and too rushed. Characters just instantly know and understand things and accept everything with ease. It is easy to over look all this, with how much fun you'll have.",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

","Well definitely the best production by marvel following Endgame. An absolute treat to watch. The main attraction is obviously the amazing fight sequence that's up there with the best fight scenes of MCU, and also the background music is perfectly fitting to the tone and setting of the film. What many might think that the plotline does not have enough depth. But I'd beg to differ as the way they've changed the Shang Chi character, introducing his father as the wielder of the ten rings and changing the power of the rings altogether is an amazing approach itself. The merging of different components and changing the storyline from the comics has been common in the MCU but none of them is as unique as shang chi. I'd say if they brought the original shang chi from the comics, then it would've been a mediocre movie. But they made every character unique, even the villain has a backstory to which everyone can relate. The fight sequences give goosebumps everytime I watch 'em.

The Marvelites should not lag behind anyone or anything, so it was necessary to burn down their magical world without blackjacks and strangers, but with a variety of creatures, including, his mother, dragons (not a mother, although we will see the mother of dragons). The mandarin or simply Xu Wenwu, thanks to the magic rings (and it is not known who he is to remove the rings) conquered the lands for centuries until he got tired of it. At the end of the last century, he began searching for a certain mysterious village, in which, according to legend, many mythical animals live. However, at the entrance he met love, with which he performed something like a dance, after which they got married and lived happily (this is not an Indian movie!). The worlds of ""Flying Daggers"" and ""Mood for Love"" converged - at this sweet moment it was possible to finish the film.

On the other end of the spectrum was the rushed and dull car escape about two-thirds the way through. Many other parts of the movie fell along a similar spectrum: our protagonist and his sister were rich and flowing characters, while their friend Katy and much of the supporting cast felt rushed and dull. Additionally, the movie spends a significant amount of time painting lore and background knowledge while skirting around essential questions, like, ""What is the function of the 10 rings?"" ""What is the prejudice between Xu Wenwu and the residents of Ta Lo,"" and ""Did Shang-Chi actually get stronger in his late training sequence?""

","'Black Widow' may have been the first Marvel Cinematic Universe film to hit theaters following the recommencement of major films debuting in theaters after the COVID 19 pandemic numbers dropped, however, 'Shang-Chi' is the true start of the next wave of MCU development. All of the original characters, minus Thor, have been retired from service by death or other means so new blood is required via new superheroes and new origin stories, and given the current state of affairs look for a much more diverse flavor of super-hero going forward. 'Shang-Chi' marks the first step on that path with the first true Asian super-hero to hit the big screen starring Simu Liu in the title role who is originally from China although his parents immigrated to Canada when he was only five.

","You may (or may not) find Shang-Chi to be a fun movie to see in theaters. The film is full of tropes, from the narration over an origin story, to an inner city urban flip on an distinctly Asian character, to the CGI we're to assume is real (that never quite does translate as real). This well-intentioned film about discovering who you are doesn't seem to know for sure what it is. For example, there is tie-in to the larger Marvel universe, but almost out of corporate necessity to set up subsequent movies versus narrative need to set up a deeper story inside itself. There's also more profanity than other films, often used as a momentary gag that doesn't advance the plot.

","As one of the few Asian focused superhero movies, the bar for succeeding is much higher and unfortunately, the director and screenwriters failed to meet that bar. Flashbacks accordingly should only be used rarely and only if necessary to really enhance the overall movie, not as some fashionable stylistic preference. Some of the overly dramatic characterizations of Asians still linger in this movie and the insistence of achieving a fusion of Guardians of the Galaxy comedy with the more straightforward Ironman franchise underwhelms unlike the way Black Widow and Dr. Strange found their own loft dry wit that especially Asian movies truly deserve. The Asian-American director overly Americanized the more Eastern nuance of this movie that could have incorporated a more serious and credible presentation of ethnic culture like The Black Panther or Wakanda. In effort to create a mainstream Asian superhero loses too much in its development and presentation. While avoiding obvious stereotyping and parodies, Shang-Chi only duplicates past superhero movies and fails to truly reach the potential of the contribution that an Asian perspective could offer to the adventure, action movie genre.",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

Yes, the plot is very generic, screenwriters decided to play it safe, but to be honest the story does not have incoherences or any other big issues and it runs pretty smoothly. Maybe the middle section was a bit boring and repetitive. Cutting a few scenes it would have been a bit better, but overall, I would not change that much. Fighting scenes are absolutely stunning, there are many creative and intense stunts. The CGI looks way better compared to other recent Marvel products. For sure there was a lot of dedication that definitely paid off. If only this company would be more consistent in this department, we would have better films overall. None of the performances is Oscar worthy, but the cast did a solid job and the actors were nice in their roles.

Cinematography showcased breathtaking martial arts choreography, and the directing kept the pace engaging. The film's strength lies in its representation and the exploration of family dynamics, with Wen Wu's character being a highlight.

","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings far surpassed any expectations I had. It's easily the best Marvel movie post-Infinity Saga (I know, that's not exactly saying much), and is very promising for the quality of Marvel's next projects. We have probably the second best villain intimately tied to the origin of a new, entertaining, and capable hero full of potential, in a story that ties the universe together and teases upcoming events in tantalising and unexpected ways. The fight choreography was on point, the dialogue was seeped in cultural significance, the jokes all land, and the CGI is some of the best since Thanos himself. Shang-Chi is an all-out success for Marvel, it seems in multiple ways - both critically and financially. Really its only downfall is that at times this doesn't feel like that much of a movie about Shang-Chi himself purely because his origin is tied so closely to the story of the Ten Rings. Instead it's a Ten Rings movie featuring Shang-Chi, which is fine, but feels a bit weird for his introduction into the MCU. And yes, the Ten Rings are tied up with the Iron Man films perfectly, almost making the whole Aldrich Killian thing better in retrospect.

","Shang-Chi has great special effects and a compelling storyline but the script doesn't get too emotionally deep. This is one of the major liabilities of trying to tell a good story in about 2 hours. You simply can't because it takes time for viewers to develop care, concern, and emotional attachment to characters. So, what is best told in 2 hours? Robust short stories with excellent special effects that can only be enjoyed on the big screen. To this end Shang-Chi delivers in loads. The action is fast and the camera work while a bit dizzying captures the action very well. The only major issue I had with the plot is with the monsters that the heroes are fighting against. If you watch Chinese wuxia or xianxia dramas, you know that stories involving magical beasts are always based on Chinese mythology, Taoism, Buddhist, Chinese folk religion, traditional medicine, etc. Taoist immortals spouting what sounds like gibberish to laypeople is a classic character trope. The evil creatures that Shang-Chi fights against do not fit into the xiaxia genre world view. If they are demons no explanation is given for why they are so demonic? Have they been denounced by a bohisattva? Are they former immortals who failed to cultivate and somehow reincarnated into the hungry ghost realm? It may just be that wuxia and xianxia are so deeply developed (and this is obvious when you watch any popular Chinese historical drama--from ""Eternal Love"" ot ""Legend of Fuyao"") that deivating from these highly developed genres makes the film feel less ""Chinese"". While many elements of Shang-Chi resemble a Chinese fantasy drama the lack of proper wuxia and xianxia elements makes it feel like philosophically something is missing--at least from someone who watches a lot of these dramas on Rakuten Viki!",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

","Phase 4 has been really dissapointing for me because I dont feel anything is building up to anything and the stories are getting repetitive and a little boring, so watching Shang Chi I was expecting more of the same but it was actually a pleasant surprise. The story still isnt building for anything extraordinary but the little one it tells surprised me for how entertaining it was. Mainly because of the fights; I absolutely love hand to hand fights and some of those choreographies were really good and I like that it feels a little different from other Marvel movies. But it still has some problems, like the CGI in some scenes, sometimes it looks really bad and not believable at all. And despite me loving the hand t hand fights, there are moments where they looked like Bollywood fights. The final battle also was a little dissapointing ebcause despite they talking about the dragon, they kinda used it like a deus ex machina because it so suddenly appear and defeats they main evil thing. And the worse thing of all was Shang Chis friend, Awkawfina. I hate her, shes not funny, shes always interrupting serious stuff, she doesnt act at all, she still jokes when shes about to get killed, I hate her. I was hoping shang chis dad would kill her or something because I couldnt stand her, I wished her to be dead. But aside from her, all other characters were OK, I really liked shang chi and his sister and Im really looking forward to see more of them.

It added a new dimension to the Franchise with new characters and locations. The plot was good. Was great to see Sir Ben Kingsley back in his comedic role as Trevor Slattery. He genuinely was loads of fun. I also loved seeing cameos from Wong and The Abomination. Unsuspecting and a nice surprise. One of my few criticisms really was the end battle. The CGI was on overload and Marvel seem to live these big battles.

1520,20 October 2021,lumieretrain,8," Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings by Destin Daniel Cretton
","The stories which follow warriors who have to confront a hard past, filled with pain and remorse, are intriguing to see how the main characters are getting self confident on both physically and psychologically. As the main characters through their body language they express on the way they are feeling emotionally, especially during the fight sequences, which initially their body language might be insecure to immediately lose their fight; but after the main characters have learnt in what they are looking for, their body language becomes more self confident and especially stronger, to even be ready to face their final battles to be often much intense than the first ones. The filmmaker Destin Daniel Cretton seems interested to explore this theme, by developing a new movie for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this time about the character Shang-Chi. After a long time of work, in 2021 came out Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings by Destin Daniel Cretton, with Simu Liu, Awkwafina, Meng'er Zhang, Tony Leung, Fala Chen and Michelle Yeoh. The movie's plot: The martial artist Shaun/Shang-Chi (Simu Liu), who in once has been trained to be an assassin, has left his past on the back to live in his own life in San Francisco; until his father Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung), who is in the command of the Ten Rings organization, has reunited him and his sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) to search something essential in the village Ta Lo, where Ying Li (Fala Chen) the mother of Shang-Chi and Xialing guarded in once. The movie has captured a lot of attention, by surprising the audience, the critics and the fans of Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, as the story went in a different direction than what the previous movies of the Marvel Cinematic Universe have gone, even the movie has maintained some of the established superhero elements in the cinematic universe. Especially for the way the movie explores the Asian culture, by using the Chinese mythological creatures, to let the audience feel emerged in another culture, through the settings and the colors to be expressive on the emotions of the story and on the feeling of the characters. The story gets much expressive in the emotions of the characters, through the choreography in the fight sequences, where their movements and their steps represent the way of how they will confront their greatest battles, both internally and externally. The production designer Sue Chan has elaborated the settings with specific details, to be expressive through the mythological look to the let the eyes of the audience be emerged in the story; at the same time, some of the most specific settings are filled with colors, which make them much powerful of the emotions and of the meanings on some of the most crucial moments of the story. The costume designer Kum Barrett has created costumes which fit with the shape and the colors of the characters, as most of them have been specifically elaborated to fit in their movements during the fight sequences; especially when the costumes fit with the body language of the characters, which can be felt without distorting their movements. The cinematographer William Pope has captured in every single camera movements as well as in every single angle shots, with the help of the lightnings, the shadows and the colors, some of the most essential shots of the scenes, which make some of the most essential moments of the story unforgettably poetic and mythological. The editors Elísabet Ronaldsdóttis, Nat Sanders and Harry Yoon have created the narration's rhythm in a clear way on how the story will be told from the beginning to the end, without distorting the narration of the story and by using essential footage which create the movie. The visual effects have been specifically elaborated to create some of the most spectacular scenarios of the story, in every single details of pixels to let the eyes of the audience be emerged in the story; especially through the settings, colors, lightnings and shadows, which make them mythologically spectacular. The score by Joel P. West has been elaborated to be more close to the Asian culture, in every single musical notes to balance the emotions of the characters; as well as some of the most essential moments of the story, to blend with the scenes without distorting the narration's rhythm nor in some of the most epic moments of the movie. Simu Liu did an excellent performance as Shaun/Shang-Chi, a martial artist who was in once trained as an assassin, to later on get away from the dramatic past to live in his own life; until his father Xu Wenwu has reunited him and his sister, where Shang-Chi has to confront his past to slowly become much confident with himself. Awkwafina did an excellent performance as Katy, the best friend of Shang-Chi who has no idea about his past, until she will come with him and learns more about him; initially she shows herself to be insecure and goofy, but since she has been involved with the mission of Shang-Chi she will become stronger internally as well as physically. Meng'er Zhang did an excellent performance as Xialing, the sister of Shang-Chi and the daughter of Xu Wenwu, who shows herself to be a strong person on the outside, but on the inside she is much vulnerable, especially because of the past which has tormented her; until she will become much confident, to be even closer to Shang-Chi and she will be the one who will later on change something important, in a crucial moment of the story. Tony Leung did an extraordinary performance as Xu Wenwu, the leader of the Ten Rings organization and the father of Shang-Chi and Xialing, who tries to be a good father for how much the love he has on them both; but since something tragic has happened, he has returned of what he used to be in once, especially to search in what he is looking for. Fala Chen did an extraordinary performance as Ying Li, the wife of Xu Wenwu and mother of Shang-Chi and Xialing, who will be seen often times in the flashbacks for an important reason; she has been the reason to have a family with Xu Wenwu, as in the flashbacks Ying Li has taught some of the most essential lessons to Shang-Chi. Michelle Yeoh did an excellent performance as Ying Nan, the guardian of Ta Lo and the aunt of Shang-Chi and Xialing, who will be the one to explain what is Xu Wenwu looking for and she will be also the one to teach Shang-Chi, Xialing and Katy, with the help of the rest of the village, how to become much confident with themselves. Shang-Chi and the Legend of Ten Rings is an unexpectedly surprising movie, which uses some different elements from the previous Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, it is one of the best movies of the cinematic universe as well as one of the best movies of 2021.",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

","Right from the start I realised that the plot structure and storyline was very standard and repetitive. It's seen in many other action/superhero films. But as the action kicked in, I was still invested. It's a very fast paced movie with some new action sequences we haven't seen in the mcu yet, as well as some good comedic moments. The choreography for the action is one of the best I've seen in a long time. Very long cuts show all the action without quick cuts after every move someone takes. It's also a very beautiful film I thought in terms of scenery and colours. Music was also great, epic score and some killer songs. Definitely check out the soundtrack. But as the film entered its long third act, the ending was very underwhelming. We are being thrown at with so much stuff in a short period of time, so the reveals of some things and actions aren't as interesting as they should of been. But the film has opened up even more possibilities for what's to come in the mcu timeline, so make sure to stay for those credits scenes. But even someone who hasn't seen any or a few mcu films can watch this as it's a good standalone film. They may not understand a few things that characters talk about regarding previous events but I could assume that they'd still be invested. Overall, a solid entry for our new character Shang-Chi in the mcu, as well as having some awesome action, funny moments and eye popping miss en scene.",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

","If you don't know Tony Leung's influence in the Chinese movie industry, I recommend watching Grandmaster by Wong Kar-Wai (probably one of the best Chinese movie in this century). The story itself really didn't impress me, because every Marvel movie sort of has a pattern by now, and the script writers are basically replacing different characters into corresponding spots. However, I do get Marvel's intention of enlarging their superhero community to outside of the western world through the huge amount of mandarin conversation. Also, as a typical Chinese, the movie's theme of parent's expectation colliding with the new generation's rebellion, really resonates with me. Specifically, Tony Leung's depiction of an adherent, reserved, and occasionally ruthless father is one biggest reason I gave this film a 7. Talk about character, I truly don't appreciate the performance of our protagonist: I think the long and dull middle section describing Shang's mother's death is simply trying to waste time and cover up the fact that this character has no soul. Aside from that, the actions scenes are pretty well-done, especially the starting due between Wenwu and Shang's mother.

","Masaki Kobayashi was a pacifist. The celebrated Japanese filmmaker, best-known for ""The Human Condition"", took the unusual and daring position of denouncing his country's military actions during WWII. Somehow, Kobayashi got ""The Thick-Walled Room"" financed, and pushed it past the censors, even though it broached the largely taboo subject of war crimes. Set in an American detention center, war veterans express guilt and remorse, and most importantly, hold themselves accountable for their actions. ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", directed by Dustin Daniel Cretton, is evocative of Kobayashi's ideology circumlocutorily by referencing ""Kwaidan"", in particular, ""The Woman of the Snow"", the second in a quartet of ghost stories, which was the filmmaker's only foray into genre; the horror movie. Xu Wenwen(Tony Leung), aka ""The Mandarin"", a warmonger blessed with everlasting life, learns the whereabouts of Ta Lo, a village secreted away behind thick foliage. It's people know how to fight like gods. Surviving the ambulatory trees that claim the Xu's discovery party, he encounters Li(Fala Chen), the divine martial arts' most experienced practitioner, his future wife, in what can only be described as a grindhouse meet-cute. Whereas The Mandarin harnesses his power through the ten rings, Li only needs her bare hands to win the battle with relative ease. Without the ten rings(nunchucks being its closest analogue), The Mandarin is no Bruce Lee, whose hands they say, as the legend goes, were unregistered lethal weapons. Inexplicably, Li falls in love with this psychopath, whose penchant for violence rivals The Joker.",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

","This movie had so much potential with its story. For it is a new superhero, they could've done a unique film. But sadly, it is a movie plagued by the MCU formula. The theme of family isn't developed here. I feel like the movie could've shown more vital scenes the showed more. Cause the ideas are there, but it's more of a show don't tell situation. This movie's comedy is a waste here. As much as I like Awkafina, her funny moments in this film killed it for me. This movie should've been more serious and darker, but we need comedy. And the action isn't working for me. I'm not going to deny the choreography is well made, and the final fight between Shang Chi and his father was excellent, but for a movie with a resounding theme, they made their fight scenes fun or consumer friendly. Heck, even the battle of the two armies or clans has no one killing each other, and I'm like, why. Because this is a movie for a younger audience so less gore and more cgi. The cgi monster fight is just egregious, story-wise. It's also sad for people not to like this movie for the wrong reason, like about women. Instead, please focus on the story, the theme, and the character's lack of development cause they lack build-up. This movie could've been great if it went a different route, but it didn't.

","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is one of the best projects to come out of Phase 4 of the MCU. Before seeing the film, I honestly thought this film would not live up to expectations at all. In the end after viewing it, I was dead wrong as it lived up to the hype and expectations that fans hoped for. Living a normal life in San Francisco California, Shang-Chi's life is interrupted when his past life forces him to confront the sins of his past and become the person he was truly meant to be. So first off, Simu Liu as the title character Shang-Chi was born to play this role and pulls it off masterfully. Awkwafina as Katy I also thought was great and her chemistry with Simu Li's Shang-Chi is perfect. Tony Leung Chiu-wai as Shang-Chi's dad Xu Wenwu/ The Mandarin was absolutely incredible, showing us the grief he has, while also showing us how sentimental he can be making him my favorite character of the entire film. Meng'er Zhang's Xu Xialing was also a great addition to the film as well as Michelle Yeoh's Ying Nan. I was also glad to see the return of Ben Kingsley's Trevor Slattery from Iron Man 3 and is another one of my favorite characters of the film. When it comes to the visuals and the story, they are some of the best to come out of Phase 4 and probably one of the best origin stories to come the the MCU in a long time. Overall, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings lives up to expectations as the next great MCU film that has great visual, a incredible story, and great character arcs that also looks ahead to what's to come in the MCU moving forward.

","The best parts of the story are those that were set in the USA, as they gave a nice and on point glimpse into the culture of Americans of ethnic Chinese origin. But as soon as the story moves on to Macau, and then to a ""mysterious unknown location in China"" where the Ten Rings are located, and then even further into the mystical ""Chinese"" village called Ta Lo, the movie missed the mark further and further; and it becomes increasingly obvious that this story is told entirely through an American lens, because the ""Chinese"" parts seems more like a flanderized/Disney-fied version of Chinese culture (which isn't very surprising, considering that this movie is produced by Disney). Also, while China does have outsized influence on East (and to a lesser extent South East) Asian culture (the same way that the influence of Ancient Roman culture is outsized in regards to Europe), Disney seems to think that Chinese and Asian is basically interchangeable, which is a common perception in Hollywood, but not actually true.",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

","In the last year, Disney has been leaning on Chinese cuisine. ""Mulan"", ""Raya and the Last Dragon"", and now ""Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"". The set of ingredients is surprisingly similar: we collect time-tested techniques and plot elements, throw them into a pile, upload them to the neural network and create a script. Good savings come out during the pandemic, you don't have to pay the screenwriters. In any case, I do not want to believe that these three projects had real licensed screenwriters, otherwise I will have to put up with the complete degeneration of the profession under the control of Disney. All three films are united by both the mentioned secondary nature and a disregard for the created world. The main thing is to introduce more mascotics to sell toys, and inclusivity, so that the press splashes with saliva. And the plot is for some strange people outside the target audience. The new film of the Marvel cinematic universe almost fell victim to many factors. The same scenario - it is bad, predictable, consists of everything that any viewer, whether he is a movie fan or just getting acquainted with cinema, has seen if not hundreds, then at least dozens of times. In the center, the main character is of Asian origin, living a quiet American life, but finding himself embroiled in a showdown of supernatural forces directly related to his past. He travels to different locations, meets his father, the villain, fights with him, and in the end reveals all his powers and enters into a confrontation with an older evil. Unless the main character does not turn into Mark Dakaskas, as in the TV series ""Killers of Wu"", but otherwise everything is like in a multi-series with Iko Yuvais. The second problem is the characters. Malomal charisma is possessed only by supporting actors and beyond. In the foreground, you have to look at the one-dimensional Sima Liu and Aquafina (the young lady compensates for the lack of charisma with zero acting and tantrums). Even the beauty Zhang Menger managed to depersonalize, age, and in the second half of the film completely deprive of replicas. 59-year-old Tony Leung has to carry drama and pathos, and 77-year-old Ben Kingsley has to carry humor. And what can you do if young people can't cope? However, two absolutely important problems are destroyed at the click of the Infinity Gauntlet when old Chinese militants come into play. They were lovingly cut into fragments and filled to the brim with the possibilities of modern cinema. Here's a fight on the bus, but on bamboo scaffolding - we have repeatedly seen all this at the same Jackie Chan. However, add to this a modern budget, special effects and the ability to shoot from almost any angle and get a completely new impression of the old as the world of movie fights. Yes, as in the script, it's just tracing paper from repeatedly passed and digested. But with what a soul it is recreated! The action in ""Shang Chi"" is the best and most memorable part of the film. Ideally, one day I would like to see an ""anti-director version"" of the tape, where the entire plot and dialogues will be cut out, leaving 40-50 minutes of enjoyment for the eyes. It would be possible to continue to scold the film by putting a lower rating, but it will not work - the beauty of fights almost without firearms is enough here so that the movie does not upset, but on the contrary, awakens the belief that the most inclusive phase of the MCU will be better than it seems at the moment. It's not worth waiting for miracles from the plot of the upcoming tapes right now, but at least it surprises the directors at least sometimes, but it still works out. So we sit until the end of the credits and go to sing karaoke, like all normal heroes-viewers who, despite the falling quality, still remain with Marvel.",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

There was about 7 too many slow motion scenes where characters randomly stare at each other, and the first 30-40 minutes of the film just felt so random and out of place. It is also weird that a dragon shows up at the end and sort of steals the show from Shang Chi as he is just about to start to shine and take the role as the lead protagonist. All the actors did great in their roles, but shoddy writing really brought the whole thing down for me.",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

One of the things the MCU is good at is telling stories from different genres and making them fit within the universe and this film does exactly that. This has some of the best fight sequences within the MCU. The dynamic between Shang Chi and Awkwafina's character has a very nice dynamic between the two and really play of each other. All of the characters play a part into the story and none of them really feel pushed to the side. The Villain is also one of the better ones we have in the MCU as he has these conflicting values and we see both his good and bad side. It also isn't very predictable to see what he is going to do next. Finally the director feels like they were given a lot more freedom than usual inside MCU films because of how the story is told there hasn't been many films that have been told in this sort of style or tackling these sort of issues. This movie feels like a significant film into the MCU and moving forward in the MCU which was one of my issues with 'Black Widow'.

","Shang-Chi has instantly entered my top 5 of Marvel movies. There is so much to adore about this movie. The visuals are beautiful, the villain is compelling, the last sequence isn't very predictable, as superhero movies can often be. The characters all have a level of depth that is often missing from the supporting characters in superhero movies, and I was pleased that they didn't marginalize Xialing as it would've been easy to do. I don't know much about the different disciplines of martial arts, but it seems very similar to Avatar: The Last Airbender in how they drew inspiration from different real world fighting styles for different fighters in the movie. If I compare the acting to the other movies I consider the best to produced by Marvel (Infinity War, Ragnarok, Winter Soldier, etc.), Shang-Chi is a notch below, but it blows every other Marvel movie out of the water when it comes to action and choreography. The bus scene in the first act has easily become my favorite sequence in any Marvel film. Origin films often fall into the same traps, but Shang-Chi doesn't, maybe because many didn't know much about the character. But even so, typical tropes like training sequences were done better in Shang-Chi, and the story didn't linger on his youth too much.",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

There was also not a single character out of place, awkwafina was a rare sidekick that provided comedic relief at the beginning of the film, transitioning into an integral part of the final conflict and partner for shang-chi. This storyline is distinct in its nature to focus on the development of familial bond and all of the characters, showing that each character is complex and layered. ++ (one of my favourite scenes was during shang-chi's quest to stop his father from inadvertently releasing a demonic, soul-eating monster on the world, the cinematography accurately juxtaposed the tension between shang chi and his father against the still atmosphere of the backdrop, making us understand wenwu's heartbreak though his actions are reprehensible, a part of us still wants to believe in his cause of action. )",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

Sound familiar? I'm in no way saying the two are parallels but this overarching story arc is becoming cliche. Black Widow was sort of guilty of this in a way, but was still unique in its own right, for better or for worse. In the case of Shang-Chi, the plot was extremely predictable.

","Was hopeful the story with a predominantly Asian cast would have succeeded as well as Black Panther did in the Marvel realm for a non-white-dominated cast, but this was such a disappointment. And what a lost opportunity! The cast was literally the only redeeming thing about the movie. Otherwise the script and CG effects were so bad that I just lost interest in the movie and stopped paying attention. It seemed like probably 95% of the movie was filmed in front of a green screen and someone did some really fast cheap animations to fill in the rest. After watching a movie like Dune (2021), where you never once get distracted by poor special effects, I know what is possible and I just can't escape into a cartoon world anymore. Even the costumes were cheap. Like they could only afford two rolls of fabric and were supposed to believe that everyone coordinated their outfits and wore brand new clothes all on the same day? And Awkwafina's character was pointless throughout the entire movie, so they gave her a purpose at the very end that made no sense at all for her character. The interest in quality was not priority for this movie at all, and really strays from the Marvel films' reputation unfortunately.

The score reminded me of Black Panther where they incorporate some pretty awesome hip hop tracks, whereas in Black Panther some of the score felt forced and out of place, this films bass drops and transition to versus added a pretty slick feel to the film. Unlike other most MCU entries post Avengers, this film didn't seem to focus on the grand plans ahead in the MCU which is okay, I personally expected a little more. I also felt like the motivations of the villain were unclear for a large portion of the film, it was hard to feel connected to any particular cause.

It really connected to the marvel universe really well I thought and it also expands it as well. The acting was top notch all around. I thought I was going to hate awkwafina but she actually did a great job she was really funny and she could get emotional in some scenes. A lot of the comedy landed but there was some minor jokes that weren't funny but I got passed those and the other jokes made up for it.the Mandarin was a really intimidating figure. I really thought he could destroy anyone. The big fight scene at the end was really awesome and it's a huge spectacle that had me on the edge of my seat. I loved how they implemented the Asian culture into the films plot. It also ties in some threads from pass movies that really made me glad to finally have answers for. The cgi was amazing and it was very awe inspiring to watch. This was way better than the last marvel movie and I really want to see more of Shang-chi in the future.

The plot plummets once they start preparing you with meaningless lore to the fantasy world and weak characters that feel like characters from a Pokémon RPG. The final fight was weak. The characters, the land, everything was super colorful that it really felt like I was watching ""Rava: the last dragon"". It's supposed to be a battle or civil war between family.

","Fair origin film. Generally, Marvel's character introduction films are slightly above average affairs. They need to introduce a character that some people may not be familiar with. This usually leads to a lengthy stretch of the beginnings of those movies to be slow. This movie, however, felt like it kicked off fairly quickly and maintained a decent pace. After the ramp up to Infinity War and Endgame, and bombastic, wild action in them, this movie feels like a step back. However, you need to keep in mind that this is the beginning of a new story arc in the MCU. Build up is necessary.

","My review..
Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings has easily joined my top 10 list of the best movies I've ever seen... just like that. Marvel has created another masterpiece alongside Black Panther with excellent cinematography, A-1 story telling from the origin, to the subtle demolishing of Asian American stereotypes, the cameos that bring the marvel universe into unity, and even to the timing of the comic relief. These characters knew the assignment and delivered top tier performances in the choreography, plus the VFX was on Snyder's team level, imo. Arguably the best Marvel movie to date. But also one of the best Kung Fu movies in its own lane. This new Phase in the saga has a bright future if they're coming in this hot. Let me find out, Spider Man.",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

","When watching Shang- Chi you will almost immediately see that it follows the same formula as every other marvel movie, but there is one thing that this movie excels at and that is the choreography. The choreography is some of the best seen in the the marvel universe and maybe even in cinema in general. The character of Shang- chi (played by Simu Liu) is a great addition to the MCU, but I can not say the same for some of the other characters in the movie especially the character Katy.(played by Awkwafina). The character is very flat and childish making her almost annoying though I believe that this is the fault of the writers and not Awkwafina. Another aspect of this movie that I like is the cameos, while I will not mention them to avoid spoilers, I will say that they are definitely one of my favorite parts of not only this movie but of the MCU in general. All in all I give Shang-chi a 9 out of 10. Great movie.",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

Also, the movie couldn't quite decide on the tone. Half the time it was funny, and the other half it wanted to be dark.

The fight scene were beautifully shot, but sometimes they cut my tension by throwing in some jokes and puts in too much CGI and it cheapens the fight scene. The jokes, music and the CGI works well in some places but also doesn't work well in some places especially during the third act. The visual in this film were great but in some scene it looks so cartoonish with this green screen stage area and it looks bad during the third act.

","I don't give 10/10 stars on most things but this was close. The thing that makes this different from a bunch of other superhero movies is that halfway through the movie I was already invested in the characters. Most origin movies focus on one or two characters to make you understand where they're coming from to prepare you for the sequel. But in this it was clear that the characters were all people with great depth. Comparing this to other marvel origin movies I would say that this one takes the cake, each and every one on one fight scene felt so tense and also like a dance. The cinematography was also brilliant, I could tell what characters were thinking and how they felt from angles and hue alone. I also really enjoyed how the movie wasn't all about Shang-Chi but it was also about all the other characters in his life and how they related to the situations they were in with him. With all this said I have to say that my favourite part was how invested I felt with several of the characters, I could understand the villains, Shang-Chi, and all the other main cast.

I understand her whole thing is comic relief, but I personally didn't find it funny. It's almost like they're trying to appeal to one specific demographic with her character (which I understand and I'm just not the target audience). But everytime she makes a joke it's like I'm supposed to just wait for it to be done so the story can continue. If her character was completely removed from the movie, nothing would change and that's the biggest problem. She doesn't add anything. And when you have to watch a movie with a character he adds nothings but time to a movie, it gets a little annoying. Also. The arrow? There's no reason she should've been able to make that shot.

","It was so full of potential. The opening sets a great foundation for the movie. With a fine fusion of the distinct aesthetic of ""wuxia"" (chinse martial art) and western/modern cool-ass elements, and great action parts, the movie could have became a unique and refreshing piece. Instead, it ends up as a cliche superhero story that attempts to discuss the Chinese cultural significance and understanding of family, but fails to do so in depth. Countless plot tools that barely make sense, such as Katy being able to hit at the evil creature's face, or the mysterious abrupt awaken of the dragon when summoned by Shangchi, are employed to conform to the typical expectations of a super hero movie. The costume design and mythical creatures at the end further worsened the movie experience by wiping out completely the remaining wuxia atmosphere, which in my opinion, is the best part of this movie. Shangchi and the legend of the ten rings really doesn't live up to my expectations of MCU's phase 4 works.

The cinematography and choreography create a visually stunning movie, with a lot of Wuxia mixed in for scenes involving the mother and her people (thing Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), with some more traditional MCU fighting in others (the bus scene and the fight outside the skyscraper!). Simu Liu is adorable and wonderful, and although I am not a fan of Akwafina I will say she did a good job in this role, and Michelle Yeoh is always beautiful and engaging in everything she does. However, for me, Tony Leung was amazing. He conveys so many emotions effortlessly. He is not a remorseless killing machine, he has a purpose, and although misguided, he believe in it. He's also smoking hot so he has that going for him. This movie reminds me of Black Panther, both have strong story lines and are visually arresting, and they don't need the entire MCU to move the plot.

But truly, the movie felt as if those bad Chinese fantasy action flicks had teamed with a knock off version of Need for speed with only crappy cars. It was insanely tailored to the Chinese market which wouldn't have been a bad thing, if Disney hadn't copied the Transformers IV strategy of going Chinese. As it is, this is the first MCU movie we find even less than mediocre. This movie makes the Incredible Hulk and Spiderman 3 look like good movies.

Tony Leung really lit up the screen. I kinda wish Simu Lui spent a little more time refining his Kung fu moves. I'm nitpicking, but he was a bit stiff. Could've done without Akwafina. Some jokes fell flat for me, but I'm not a die hard Marvel fan. And lastly the disrespect of a magical mythical creature was icky to me. Not even Harry Potter steps on the face of a dragon.

The Mandarin is one of the greatest MCU villains we have ever seen. I wish this was the true Iron Man 3 villain. However there is comic relief and exposition characters accompanying our heroes throughout much of the film that takes the bite out of the stakes.

","Marvel Shang chi review
Pros:-
The fight scenes in this movie are next level cool
Weapons and costume design is really good
Plus Shang chi's sisters ka weapon is really badass
This movie is really cool and doesn't take itself too seriously
This is a really fun movie with great fight scenes
Personally, I didn't like Katy that much but it's my personal opinion and not a problem
Shang chi is really badass but his dad is my fav character in the whole movie
He really cool and I'm really impressed from his dad
I think plot is really cool aur the way Shang chi's rings connect with kamar taj is also fascinating(anything related to doctor strange is cool)
Seeing the ten rings in fights and other scenes is just really cool
Shang chi's cgi is mind blowing aur in the last fight, the CGI was just brilliant
Cons:-
the Ending was really cliche and generic
It's was almost anticlimactic, like if it was just too easy
Shang chi is a great movie besides the ending, (it's ending was really similar to aquaman's end)
Shang chi's sister was a really cool character and it was a shame because her role in the film is frighteningly less
But besides the ending, there aren't a lot of faults in the movie
Overall shang chi:-8/10
If the ending would have been a bit unpredictable and just a little cooler, it would have been a 9.5/10
But overall it's a good movie that I would suggest watching.",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

","While moving away from the main storyline this movie doenst feel like a quick cash grab but a full fledge story with lots of work and study behind. The universe gets even more depth when we notice the references to tradicional chinese culture even in the middle of the fight scenes its possible to notice reference to chinese dramas where we have long flight moments when the receive some kind of impact, so yeah.",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

","The most memorable aspect of the film is undoubtedly the serene lake. I never expected the legendary dragon to reside right next to the village. Witnessing the dragon and Shang-Chi emerge from the water together, I suddenly recalled the phrase, ""The depth of the water does not reveal the presence of the dragon."" In this mystical realm, everything possesses spirit. The mountains are spirit mountains (albeit haunted spirits), so it is only fitting that the water also holds its own spiritual significance.",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021

","Sure, I'm not a marvel superfan. But I watch some of the movies. And they are usually quite fun and digestible. But The Legend of the Ten Rings just takes itself too seriously. The story is quite simple, but they have padded the runtime a lot.

2492,27 May 2022,edwardliu168,8," Good but not Great
","Let's start off with some of the best aspects of this film that might make one want to watch this movie. There are some excellent fight scenes such as the one you saw in the trailer on the bus, the climatic ending and also a dynamic one that moves across several different floors. Another aspect that might be appreciated is that the actors are actually Asian and speak Mandarin. However, as a native speaker myself, I was mostly impressed by the translations, but some of them were off and I don't know why, I understand why sometimes you might need to convey the meaning more than the literal word for word translation, but some of them didn't even do that and I was very confused as to why. The visuals in general are a treat and the depiction of the valley in the last part of the movie is a feast for the eyes. Anytime the rings themselves are on screen is interesting to watch as well. Now to get on to some negative aspects, chief among them in my opinion is the plot. The resolution seemed completely unsatisfactory for me and did nothing to resolve the conflict that had been built up during the course of the film. Speaking of the course, the pacing is also very strange, it starts perfectly fine, introducing the main characters and their parent, explodes into action, but then just has a slump for a while after the second fight scene and then stays flatline until the final battle making the movie felt like a television series that got shrunk down. This pacing works fine in television, where an episode might just be exposition and another is exciting, but when it comes to a movie, a self-contained package, it seems like a strange choice. Another thing to note, but not necessarily an issue, is that it's interesting that this Marvel film has a character willing to kill, their own father no less, a rather bold choice for its time that I did not expect, but also made me slightly uncomfortable as I had not seen any non-POC characters so openly discuss premediating a murder. Finally, given the context of this movie's release, the ending scene did really look hilariously small compared to coming off the heels of Endgame, but the cultural nuances that were captured, the pull of duty and yearning for independence is well depicted. It's certainly worth a watch but just don't expect it to be the best Marvel or Kung Fu movie, very much well done but middle of the pack, but my, what an impressive pack it is.",/review/rw7800707/?ref_=tt_urv,ShangChi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings_2021
