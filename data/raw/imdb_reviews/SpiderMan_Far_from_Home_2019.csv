0,3 July 2019,cardsrock,8," Spidey's delightful new adventure
",It's hard not to enjoy this quirky teen romance disguised as a Marvel movie. This Spider-Man sequel is hilarious and charming. It swings along through a great story and takes time to enjoy itself along the way. There are some terrifically trippy sequences that showcase the coolness of Mysterio. Gyllenhaal brings his typical great performance and is one of the better Marvel villains. Far From Home is loads of fun and a great segue into the next era of the MCU.,/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

","And so my long Marvel-watching journey comes to an end; I've finally caught up with the endless franchise, after what seems like eons playing catch-up with the rest of the world's population. Sadly, this SPIDER-MAN sequel is a real step down from the highs of AVENGERS: ENDGAME, and a feeling like they've gone backwards given how they learnt what worked so well previously. Personally, I've found both of Holland's outings as the web-slinging hero to be middling at best.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

","The final battle between Spiderman and Mysterio, where Spidey falls into the middle of a cloud of light-show, weapons-toting drones and doesn't even get a scratch worth crying over, is pretty much a microcosm of this entire movie. After ENDGAME, it feels more like housecleaning and treading water than a Spiderman adventure. There are no stakes to speak of-- Spidey seems indestructible at this point and I never felt any of his comic relief buddies were seriously in danger.

","Far from Home is a great sequel with a lot of very good action sequences, and very well developed characters that just make this entire movie very fun to watch.
Tom Holland is the best Spider-Man/Peter Parker ever, he is so charismatic and funny, plus he is great in the action scenes as well. Him and Zendaya have great chemistry, and thankfully they developed her character, MJ, a lot more this time around. Also in my opinion, Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio works for what the film was going for, and Jake is just great in everything he does so there's no surprise there.

11,15 February 2020,leonblackwood,4," Fed up with watching an immature Spider-Man. 4/10
","Review:
Will they ever get this franchise right? I really wasn't a fan of this film because the whole ""teenager on a school trip"" concept was ridiculous, and the script was awful. They tried there utmost to make it funny, but it just didn't work, and Tom Holland's constant whining about how much he wanted to be with his school friends, and trying to get the girl, became tedious after a while. I can't believe that Spider-man went through the whole of Infinity War and Endgame, saving the world with the Avengers, and ended up dodging Nick Fury's calls because he wanted to be with his friends. On top of that, the humongous creatures that were attacking Europe weren't enough for the school to cancel the trip, which was totally unrealistic. The major twist in the film was also written badly, which was a shame because I actually liked Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) before he turned dark. On the plus side, I did like seeing the aftermath of Tony Stark death, and how the so-called ""blip"" affected the world, but with all that in mind, Spider-man still was acting like an immature teenager, even though he was heavily involved in the battle against Thanos. The whole drone concept was also completely ridiculous, and the fact that no one realised that it was all an illusion, blew my mind. Although I found the film disappointing, Tom Holland is a good Spider-man, in terms of his movements and action scenes, but I think it's about time that he took his role as a super-hero seriously. I don't know how close the character is to the comics, so I can't totally blame the director for his vision but I'm really getting fed up with his boyish behaviour, especially after Tony Stark took him under his wing. The action scenes made the film watchable, even though they were extremely far-fetched, and the ending left the franchise open for many possibilities, but I still expected more after Endgame. Disappointing!",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019
12,4 July 2019,jsucie,8," Non-spoiler short review
","So I watched Homecoming last night and watched Far From Home this afternoon. Overall this was a entertaining movie than Homecoming but with a far weaker plot. The more engaging bits is the interaction between the characters.
Jake G. did an decent job as Mysterio but overall the character was written without much character strengths.
CGI was fantastic as always with Marvel Movies. This will make money, this will entertain. It isn't one of the better ones though.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

","Far from home was under a lot of pressure from Endgame and homecoming in order to live up to the expectations set by both movies. It had to confront the problems and heartbreak from the last Mcu film while retaining the humour and action from the previous Spider-Man film. Not only does it do this far more successfully than I could have imagined, yet it adds so much more to the film. From unexpected plot twits to silly romance.

21,11 July 2019,matthewssilverhammer,8," A Saturday Morning Cartoon On the Big Screen
","Far From Home feels like a throwback, though not really to anything in superhero film history. Superhero movies have almost always carried a heavy weight of nostalgia, fandom import, and franchise insurance on to their silver screen escapades. And even though the latest web-slinging adventure directly follows one of the most ambitious cinematic projects in history (Avengers: Endgame), it somehow finds a way to shed all that in favor of pure, escapist, one-off fun. With lighthearted soul, a travelogue setting, an endlessly relatable hero and a compassionate but cartoonish villain, Far From Home is a Marvel movie made for the Saturday-morning-cartoon crowd.
After the world-altering events of ""the snap"", Peter Parker is trying to get back to some semblance of normalcy, when a high school Eurotrip gets interrupted by multiverse superhero Mysterio and some big elemental bad guys. All the everyday superhero facets are here (funny quips, questions of self-worth, great action sequences), but with the added element of an angsty teenage comedy. How does he tell MJ he likes her? Can he and his bff stay friends while having girlfriends? What kind of fun can they get into in Europe? This seems low stakes, and I suppose it is in comparison to much of the MCU, but that's what makes the story work: we know these characters on a personal level, and we like them for it.
Honestly, after the Infinity Saga ended, with all its drama, death and destruction, Far From Home's down-to-earth, low-stakes, neighborhood feel is exactly the comedown we needed. With no overarching plotlines, no big universal threat, and few crossover implications, this manages to be a perfect summer escape.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

The movie could've taken a darker turn but this being a summer release and it's protagonist is still in high school, we're treated to seeing Peter needing a vacation and a break from all the superheroing (remember he had to be saved by all the women in Avengers, still one of the coolest sequence in Endgame) and the mourning of Tony Stark's passing.

This is the second Spider_Man movie with Tom playing our hero-the first was in 2017-and it takes place right after Avengers:Endgame. In fact, they talk a lot about the consequences of what happened in Endgame, such as the deaths. Tom is going on vacation in Europe with his fellow classmates-and teachers-when he runs into Samuel/Nick Fury. It seems Samuel has need of Spider_Man's services to work with a new hero from another dimension, Jake/Mysterio. In the other dimension, Jake was fighting 4 elemental creatures comprised of fire, water, earth & wind. The creatures came to our world so Jake pursued them here and has dispensed with two of them already but could use Tom's help on the last two. Tom doesn't think he is the right super hero for the job-he thinks the creatures are out of his league-and all he wants to do is have his vacation and spend time with Zendaya/MJ. Yep, like that's going to happen. Tom and Jake team up but if you are a comics fan-like I am-you know there is more to Jake/Mysterio than meets the eye. There are lots of good battle scenes and lots of humor to make it a great popcorn movie. There are 2 scenes at the end. One right after the end credits start and one at the very end so don't leave too early.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci_fi action and violence and a little language and has a running time of 2 hours & 9 minutes.

","Personally up their at the tip of the MCU the second solo spider man film in this continuity delivered on everything I'd hoped for. In terms of scale it felt so vast and action packed making for a brisk watch despite its fairly long run time. There's a case for it being perhaps the most impactful solo film in the marvel universe and certainly felt as such, sending the character through various turmoils to come out changed at the end. Gyllenhaal was a personal highlight and the villain felt well motivated if a little contrived/shoehorned into this world, throw in a mind blowing Mysterio illusion scene and various callbacks to prior films in the MCU and you're left with this really enjoyable product! For all it's positives it can't escape flaws and does have certain issues, Ned as a character is neglected for the sake of MJ and in a way the humour dips as a payment for this but aside from a few other minor niggles there's little else wrong. Packing a reveal that could be hugely impactful for the fate of future marvel films I'd argue it's not only a must see but one of the best in the whole 20+ films currently released.

","Just got from the movies. Even though I picked up a lot of spoilers before seing the movie, still enjoyed it very much. (Thank you. Give me more!) I will try not to spoil it here though.
I do not understand why having 8.1 and now 8.0 this title is not near top 250. Probably because of top voters policy.... 6 years on this site still cannot understand the deal with voter's voice unequality...
Anyways, Tom Holand is the best Spidey and this movie is the best Spider-Man movie. Some might argue second instalation of Reimi's trilogy is the best one. I, personaly, not sure about that. I had so much fun watching it, even though the villain's true intentions are kinda obvious . We all know what kind of person Mysterio is, aren't we? So noone can spoil that part, yes?
The film relies a lot on comedy and after Endgame it is exactly what we need. Drama is still present, so it does not tilt to laughter all the way side.
The return of probably the biggest oponent of Spider-man is so much fun, and rises so many question to the future that protagonist holds in the MCU.
Zendaya is great as MJ, and mixed race cast is great overall in the movie. And does not feel obligated and SJW lobbied. ( Little Mermaid wink)

But Tom is something else, he is the most original Spider-Man we've seen in the movie theaters because with his age and attitude he portrays Spider-Man perfectly. This movie was overall amazing, it had a lot of funny moments that were not dull or boring, the acting was great from everybody, especially the vilalin played by Jake who is among the best actors of the 21 century.

","I liked Spiderman: Far From Home. I enjoyed it a lot. I am still surprised at the type of fan fare it is getting though with many people giving it a ten and saying it's the best live action spiderman they've ever seen. I wouldn't go that far to giving it credit. What it does well is follow up Endgame very well and tells a whole new story. It also manages to bring the underlying story of Spiderman to the big screen and that is a kid with superhero powers trying to balance that with being a teenager and falling in love and school and friends etc. This manages to capture that very well considering it's all about monsters and aliens and destruction. The CGI battles are plenty and the CGI is quite well done but there is a lot of it. It was nice to have some of the younger people playing supporting cast members like Zendaya (who actually makes a very good, layered MJ) , Jacob Batalon and Angourie Rice. Jake Gyllenhaal plays a decent villain as the bizarre Mysterio. He sort of overplays it, a little campy at times but it works for the most part. I didn't think his chemistry with Tom Holland was all that great but it was still good to see a new villain on the big screen. Speaking of chemistry, I think Tom Holland and Zendaya are actually great together and I wasn't sure how she would fare as Mary Jane but the two of them are quite good together.

","Watching this, i was trying to think of some negative criticism i could add here, but honestly, by the end of the movie, i still didn't have any. This is just a great and very complete movie.
This time round, Spidey teams up with a powerful superhero from an alternate Earth, while at the same time trying to woo the girl of his dreams, but all doesn't go to plan with either situation. This plot is handled very well by the writers, who keep a good balance between character development and action scenes. It's just the right length so we don't get bored or leave feeling short-changed and just when you think you know what to expect, they throw in another twist and keep you glued to the very end.
As for the special FX, it's on point, with some of the most magnificent coming towards the climax at the end and that's the way it should be.
It's great to see Fury getting more air time here too and Jake Gyllenhaal provides the mature Father figure that both Spidey himself and the viewers need after losing Iron Man.
Along with the incredible FX, the other best part about Spiderman is Tom Holland, who plays the lead perfectly and is ever watchable both as Peter Parker and his alter ego.
End game was definitely the end of a saga, but this is a through enjoyable and worthwhile epilogue.
By the way, make sure to watch to the very end, because this time, we have 2 credits scenes that will shake things up for the future of the MCU",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

The way they wrote the characters made even minor ones like Flash, Brad, and Betty entertaining to watch. Jake Gylanhall's Mysterio stands out as being one of the best villians in the MCU.

","I'm going to start off with a comparison, as I've talked with other people about this movie and they had some of the same opinions I have, even in comparison to the other Spider-Man movies. To start off, there have been a lot of Spider-Man movies. We can remember the Sam Raimi movies from the 2000s where Peter Parker was Tobey Maguire. Mary Jane Watson was Kirsten Dunst, and Aunt May Parker was played by an elderly woman. I ought to say, I seriously can't believe how long it's been since those movies came out, already more than a decade. For one, watching it even back then in 2002, I thought it had some flaws and was overrated, still a good movie. A couple of flaws, one is while the 2002 Spider-Man didn't say the year it was, even when I first saw it, I thought it looked like it took place before the time it was made 2001/2002 as I noticed they didn't even mention the internet. Another flaw, is while Tobey Maguire isn't a bad actor I thought he seemed a little old, mature, and serious for the Peter Parker Role. He reminds me of Billy, the Blue Power Ranger in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. In Spider-Man, Maguire could play a geek, though I thought the way he showed emotion didn't exactly seem realistic. His relationship with Mary Jane Watson, didn't always seem so real, mostly a neighborhood girl he was attracted to, and got along with, but I feel like it barely showed chemistry between those two like they were a good couple together. Those original Spider-Man movies were great movies though, and I think they should do a Spider-Man 4 with the original cast where we could find out what they're supposedly up to years later?",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

Jon Watts the director does some creative things to keep the audience invested. There is one fight scene that shows this creative style perfectly and trust me when I say it never gets boring. All of the shots are perfectly in frame so you know what's going on and where to focus your attention. Just like in the first movie all of the actors give it their all. Okay, I will admit that this sentence is probably biased because Jake Gyllenhaal, who plays Mysterio, is my favourite actor of all time but honestly he's amazing in this role. You can see him just giving it his all in this role from beginning to end. I can honestly admit that this is probably my favourite role I have ever seen him in. But the main showstopper performance was Tom Holland. Once again he plays Peter like an actual teenager who is going through grief. In every scene, you can see him questioning everything and not knowing what to do anymore because Tony isn't there anymore to help him out. After seeing him in this role I can say he definitely the best Spider-Man. Everybody else was great too and I'm happy that certain people stayed in the background. This movie doesn't overdose itself with humour and I'm happy with that because after Endgame I don't want a lot of humour in this film. But at the same time, there is some humour that was acceptable. There are 2 great post-credits scenes that you need to see especially because one teases Spider-Man 3.

The European setting is a welcome change of scenery from New York City, where all of the Spider-Man films have taken place. 'Far From Home' is a perfect mix of 'feel-good vacation movie' and 'comic book movie', and I honestly felt like I was right there on vacation with them. I've seen some people say that the first half is a little slow, but I don't have any problems with the pacing. There's a lot of comedy in the movie, and it's hilarious! A few jokes fall flat, but most of them made me laugh out loud. Pretty much every character gets at least one comedic moment to shine, which is nice. The action is exhilarating, and the visual effects are some of the best I've ever seen. There are a few scenes that feel like they were ripped straight out of a Spider-Man comic, and the film takes advantage of it's international setting to produce some incredible action set pieces. Three scenes in particular are in my Top 5 scenes in any Spider-Man movie. The characters are all very likeable, and each one brings something unique and special to the film. The acting is fantastic from the entire cast, but Tom Holland (Peter Parker/Spider-Man), Jake Gyllenhaal (Quentin Beck/Mysterio), and Zendaya (MJ) really steal the show. In my opinion, 'Far From Home' cements Tom Holland as the definitive live-action Peter/Spidey. Jake's Mysterio is PERFECT, and has become one of my all-time favorite cbm (comic book movie) characters. I love how they made Mysterio feel modern and realistic, yet stayed true to the source material at the same time. As for MJ, I wasn't crazy about her in 2017's 'Spider-Man: Homecoming', but after 'Far From Home', she might just be my favorite live-action Spidey love interest. They really fleshed out her character in this film, and she had much more depth and personality. Zendaya has phenomenal chemistry with Holland, and it shows on-screen. I'm very much looking forward to seeing their relationship grow and evolve in future installments of the franchise. Another thing I really love is the music, which compliments the film perfectly. Overall, 'Spider-Man: Far From Home' takes everything I love about it's predecessor, 'Spider-Man: Homecoming', and improves upon it, while fixing a lot of problems people (not me) have with it. It's fun, funny, action-packed, visually stunning, heartfelt: everything I could want in a Spider-Man movie, which is why it's definitely my favorite live-action Spidey feature yet! If you're looking for the perfect summer movie, I HIGHLY suggest you web-swing to your nearest movie theater and go see 'Spider-Man: Far From Home'!",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

Of course, this may be due to the fact I am a huge Spider-man fan and he and Hulk are my favorite two comic book super heroes. That may be another reason I was a bit disappointed by Endgame, because Hulk really did not do all that much and seeing a character whose trademark line in the comics is Hulk is the strongest there is! constantly get beat and be a non factor really irked me.

96,7 July 2019,Troy_Campbell,8," Charming and exciting Spidey outing
","Following the biggest cinematic event in recent memory is no easy feat, but the second solo Spidey outing within the MCU, coming a little over two months after Avengers: Endgame, is required to do just that. Knowing it can't match Endgame on either narrative heft or spectacle size, the film makes two wise moves: leans heavily into the boy-likes-girl story at its heart and lowers the stakes down a few notches from the life-altering Thanos-snap (here played mostly for minor gags). It's a great decision that allows director Jon S. Baird (returning after successfully delivering Spidey's MCU Homecoming) to keep the tone light-hearted, his intentions clear as soon as Whitney Houston's ""I Will Always Love You"" blares out during the Marvel Studios opening logo. That's not to say the threat of the Elementals - gigantic rage-monsters formed from wind, water, earth, etc etc - isn't taken seriously, but much like Peter Parker himself, the movie is more interested in our hero returning to normal teenage life. Tom Holland continues his impressive form as the awkward super-powered adolescent, finding plenty of humour (and humanity) in his attempts to ditch the costume, much to the chagrin of Nick Fury, as he deals with love, life and loss. His blossoming romance with MJ (a brilliant Zendaya) is genuinely riveting and could easily be its own film, whilst his relationships with best friend Ned (Jacob Batalon), guardian Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) and similarly-grieving pal Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) entertainingly serve their purpose despite less screen time. Not everything is a home run though. The action, although decent enough, lacks any truly memorable moments; Jake Gyllenhaal's aptly-named Mysterio fails to engage on any meaningful level; and the European setting feels strangely ill-suited to our protagonist. But these are relatively minor quibbles in an otherwise funny and rousing blockbuster that, thanks to two massively important post-credits scenes, sets up the future of the MCU in an intriguing manner. In an astoundingly high-quality franchise this can't quite push into the top tier, but Spider-Man: Far From Home is nevertheless a charming and exciting web-slinging adventure.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

","Spider-Man: Far from Home is a movie which I would watch anywhere at any time. It was a relaxing experience, enjoyable comedy with some creative surprises. Tom Holland is not my favourite Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire is the hero from my childhood), but his approach to the role is very successful, he is clearly charming and believable as the web slinger.
Although this is a movie about Spider-Man and his adventures in Europe, the star of this film is once again Tony Stark whose actions and inventions bring the main conflict points of ""Far from Home"". MCU is still really dependent on Iron Man and Mysterio is another proof for that. Mysterio made this movie quite entertaining, his music theme was an extreme pleasure and his role in the film really exceeded my expectations. I would say people will link this Spider-Man movie mostly with the presence of Jake Gyllenhaal in the cast - great actor with huge experience.
The supporting cast delivered many enjoyable moments as well - Zendaya is gorgeus as MJ, her character is intelligent and fits perfectly in the plot. Another star is Jacob Batalon as Ned Leeds - a character who is a treasure for both Spider-Man movies, it is impossible to not enjoy his scenes in the movie.
To sum up, ""Far from Home"" is one of the best sequels ever made, every character was valuable and I enjoyed every second a lot. Go and watch it, Marvel delivered again!",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

","This is such an hilarious movie cracking jokes from the start peter having his summer holiday plans rather than taking the whole superhero job too seriously until it is ready to all kick in. We first start off with Peter trying to have his innocent Romantic plan with MJ that of course does not go to plan as after the hilarious ghosting of Nick Fury he tends to hijack their summer vacation even though MJ is the only person on his mind all summer as that is all that he wants to do is spend time with her. Constantly reminded of his Father figure who he loved Tony Stark shown by Iron Man graffiti on the side of the house the beautifully well done at the start really has connotations that there something missing in Peters life his father figure Tony Stark, therefore he thinks he finds it in Quentin Beck also known as by the kids Mysterio, showing that there is more than meets the eye with him as Peter is looking for another father figure as that hole will forever be there where Tony used to be. After screwing up to start off with Peter gets MJ this cute thoughtful gift that really shows his love for her. Not to mention Ned and Bettys cute romantic relationship hitting it off from the start after a cock up Peter pulled from trying to get with MJ, which was hilarious and so cute, so the man in the chair kind of becomes the man with the romance. Peter kind of goes unnoticed by everyone else even when he disappears all most of the time to fight bad guys and this is where MJ'S And Peters chemistry really kicks in as the only person that seems to notice Peter properly and intelligently as MJ is highly intelligent young women I would say more intelligent than Peter even though she does not seem like it until you get to know her when she lets her guard down in front of Peter. MJ starts her investigation for quite some time to try and uncover what Peter is up to having a 67% sureness that Peter is Spider Man and trying to find that out to have more of a romantic connection with him to see if she could open herself up to Peter that she does in a cute and awkward romantic way. Then there is a kiss that they share in the film is truly spectacular as they are well suited to each other and just shows that MJ is more than a damsel in distress kind of bad ass. I hope that MJ becomes a hero herself she kind of is already maybe a Spider Woman even though that is doubtful for the MCU and the Spider Man Films I can still be hopeful as Peter And MJ do work really well together with their amazing romantic cute chemistry. Well Done Marvel and the rest of the cast and crew on such an amazing job with this amazing film look forward to the next Spider Man Films hopefully. Aunt May is just amazing and her not so secret obvious relationship with Happy is just romantic and cute at the same time, which is so nice to see. I highly recommend seeing this film if you have a spare two hours and nine minutes and I highly recommend you watching it at the cinema soon as the atmosphere with everybody laughing and feeling all sorts of emotions together really makes the film too.

His charming portrayal of the web slinger elevates this rather ho hum Marvel entry (Peter Parker's European Vacation) into something more than the sum of its rather messy parts. He's just so lovable, vulnerable and adorable in the role. Tom was made to play Spiderman. Physically adept and emotionally relatable, he is totally convincing as a 16 year old kid, something which the excellent Maguire and Garfield, just didn't quite get - they seemed too old to be high schoolers, whereas PP and his squeeze MJ (Zendaya) look like kids and act like kids. The plot is fun but scrappy with Jake Gyllenhall chewing the scenery as the ever so evil Mysterio and Samuel L Jackson just playing SLJ - his portrayal of Nick Fury in this outing feels like he was going through the motions.

148,19 July 2019,Abranth-d,8," The best since Spidey 2
","Here's my review of Spiderman : Far from home. So to be honest , I wasn't a big fan of Spiderman homecoming , I thought it was a good popcorn flick but that it didn't have what the og Spidey movies did. This movie however , is also a popcorn flick , but only 10x times more cooler. The story is set in a post endgame world , and it was interesting to see how things have changed since the snap's impact but in a less depressing way than how endgame showed it. Mysterio is the big baddie in this movie and his master plan is the same one from the comics and the animated shows . It's basically syndrome's plan from the Incredibles . Don't worry , that's not a spoiler. Ten seconds into this movie and you'll figure that out yourself . Despite being a cliched Mysterio plan , I liked how the writers tied his motive to the mcu , just like how they tied the vulture's motive to Stark's in homecoming. Cause if you think about it , spidermans villains have always been a part of his personal life , like the green goblin , his best friends dad , dock ock, his professor and so on. But since this version of Spiderman is more of a spiderboy than Spiderman, Its only right to set up his rogues gallery through Tony stark . Speaking of Tony stark , I liked how he was more of a mentor to Peter than a forced uncle Ben in this movie .Now the jokes , the running gags and the one liners in this movie were just wayyy funnier than the ones in homecoming. Like this romance b/w Ned and Betty , Flash Thompson's vlog and awkward convos b/w Happy Hogan and Aunt May. Also , all the supporting cast in this movie were really good and just really funny . Zendaya was also surprisingly great in this movie ! . In Homecoming when she said her name's acronyms are MJ, I was like wtf ?! But frankly she had great chemistry with Tom Holland in this movie , even though MJ doesn't stand for Mary Jane . The action scenes in this movie are insane ! Some sleek editing and cgi did the job right , there is this one scene where spidey's trapped in a trippy maze and that was just really cool to watch. The music in this movie was adrenaline pumping , especially the new score for Spiderman. Maybe I should've spoke about this at the beginning of the review , but whatever .. Tom Holland's Spiderman is actually great and has much character than in homecoming since he's in a post endgame world now . Jake Gyllenhaal was also great in this movie and had good chemistry with Peter. There were also a couple of nice Easter eggs like Morris bench the hydroman , spidermans new suit in the third act which payed homage to amazing fantasy 15 , the suitcase which has uncle bens initials and much more. So yeah ... I guess that's just about it. In the end , Spiderman : Far from home is pretty much 'Agent Cody Banks goes to London' but with the superhero juice. I can go ahead and say that far from home is an instant classic and is one of the perfect live action spiderman movies since spiderman 2 . And as always for the few who read my reviews , thank you for reading past zero paragraph breaks and punctuation errors and this long . Knowing how I type a lot when it's a superhero movie. Much appreciated . Oh yeah , and don't forget to sit in for the post and end credits unlike Endgame , you would've definitely not seen this one coming.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

151,6 July 2019,ICMooVees,9," The next major MCU hero
","After the Infinity War/Endgame events which contained the passing and dispersing of the heroes, after watching this there can be no doubt that Spider-man is going to be the next major MCU hero to carry the torch forward for the franchise. This was such a good movie with so much great content to unpack. And I would have to agree with another IMDB reviewer who cited his favorite scene as follows: ""When Peter is behaving very Stark-like in his manipulation of the suit-designing tech (in the jet) and Happy lingers for a moment as he notices the similarity.""
The challenge of making comic books come to life on the big screen takes a significant amount of insight and depth, mainly due to the nature of what a comic book is. A comic book is made up of panels (visuals and dialog) and it is up to the readers interpretation and imagination to ""fill in the blanks"" to kind of make a movie within their own minds. I believe that is the beauty and draw (no pun intended) of comic books. And it is with that challenge that makes for well-received and therefore successful super hero movies. And it is probably why some just bomb. Poor DC just can't cut it. While a few gems shine (WW and Aquaman for example), the rest seem to sputter and fail, which is somewhat surprising and sad since there is also a great wealth of DC material to draw upon that also have legendary characters. How could a JLA, Batman or Superman movie fail?
The MCU team continues to make great movies that have deep content, great writing, striking visuals, and casting actors who capture and convey the essence of what Marvel comic book reader/geeks expect. While not every MCU movie is a total home run they are still enjoyable and integral to the MCU and make for some great movie experiences.

The credits scenes were good - I liked the second one better. The first one set up another Spider-Man, no surprise, and it introduced J. Jonah Jameson, who is still played by JK Simmons. Now, personally I don't like Jameson. I find him obnoxious, and I hate that he smears Spider-Man's reputation, but I get that he's popular and from the comics that I haven't read.

After Endgame, this was a perfect film for lifting up spirits and for us all to see that even though Spider-Man isn't the strongest, most useful superhero, he's still a teenager, with much to learn, and much to understand.

If placed in the Marvel universe, Spider-Man's growth and the missing feeling for Iron Man are enough to touch people deeply.
I was pretty sad the whole time when I watching the movie because I already know the ending and everything. Peter Park, the 16 years old boy, has suffered way too much. He is not Tony Stark, but everyone wants him to be. After the end game, he is no longer the young boy who is high-minded and dreaming to be the big hero to the world like he was in the Homecoming. Now he doubts himself, he lost his confidence. He only wants to be a friendly neighbor, but he also lost the right to choose, to make the decision.

","I think everyone involved with Far from Home did an incredible job because pretty much everything in this film works. I was grinning all the way through, except when I was laughing or about to cry, or in pure awe of the surprise that is Jake Gyllenhaal in this movie. I love Gyllenhaal, that is very well documented, but he hasn't quite done a flick like this so I was curious if he will shine with what I expected to be very limited screen time. And he obviously nailed every second he had, completely. (Jake, the admiration I had for your work has completely evaporated. Not.) Though I think he should have gotten a bit more time in the second half, still, Mysterio works damn well. Think Okja, Velvet Buzzsaw and Nightcrawler, plus something totally new and fitting. That all makes his beautifully hilarious and still somehow grounded performance in this film. What he does works so efficiently in our current time. You'll know what I mean once you see this second Spider-Man movie, which by the way is much better than the first, and I like that one too. This second part is just far bigger and feels more important. Once this movie gets going, which is once it starts, it's nothing but brilliant in terms of superhero films.

","In the wake of the bombastic success of Avengers: Endgame, Marvel Studios return here with a smaller yet still lively summer flick starring everyone's favourite neighbourhood superhero. Turns out audiences are not the only ones who need to recover from the furore of recent events in the MCU (not least Thanos' genocidal antics now christened in-universe as 'The Blip'). Spider-Man: Far From Home sees our titular hero take a well-earned rest as he embarks on a school trip to Europe with his friends. He doesn't even pack his trusty suit... it's time for a bit of normality. Of course, events don't quite turn out as expected and Peter is dragged swiftly back into the world-saving game, this time to battle the multidimensional Elementals and other hidden and perhaps even more dangerous enemies.
Much of the creative talent behind 2017's Spider-Man: Homecoming return for this spirited and entertaining sequel that ends up being satisfying both for its character and in its place in the ever-widening MCU. Tom Holland dons the webbed suit yet again as Spider-Man; if he wasn't brilliant before, this time he seems even more comfortable in the role, delivering a charming, vulnerable and seemingly effortless performance. Director Jon Watts also returns proving himself to be a sure hand, his clear vision for the film shining through with distinctive style. There's a notable new addition however in writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers who deliver a smart script, often hilarious and always genuine. Far From Home is certainly a Spider-Man film on a sheer scale we haven't seen before; largely, it's handled quite well, remaining mostly grounded amid globe-trotting and narrative twists and turns. Occasionally, we lose some of the cohesion and it feels a little overstuffed and expository, but honestly this film is so fast-paced and energetic you can't help but enjoy the ride even when everything doesn't quite jell. Equally, there are far too many brilliant aspects to take in; take for instance the seamless action sequences which are neatly interchanged with intimate and believable drama. The temptation with movies of this kind is to fall into mindless action and forget the substance but Far From Home keeps its characters purely at its heart. There's nice references, for example, to Endgame that really inform Peter's arc in the film and provide the film's understated yet decidedly emotional impact. Whilst the overall package might not be as tight as its predecessor, Far From Home makes appropriate attempts to hone in on some characters and narrative vignettes in more detail (for example, Zendaya's MJ is far more fleshed out here and Peter's own sense of identity and responsibility is thoughtfully explored). Again, it's not all plain sailing; Jake Gyllenhaal's Syndrome-esque Mysterio is very hit and miss, his great moments bogged down by some of the lesser writing and obligatorily clunky exposition.
In the end, however, Spider-Man: Far From Home is an impressive film, more than making up for its faults. It's fiercely entertaining, packed full of humour, action thrills and plenty of unexpected twists to keep the audience gripped (speaking of which, stay for two critical post-credits scenes). Equally, there's some fantastic visual effects work that sometimes even echoes of the illusionary sequences in Doctor Strange. Jon Watts and his team deliver a satisfying sequel here full of interesting choices yet still staying true to the style established in Homecoming. Ultimately, regardless of its position in the Marvel canon, Far From Home has all the elements of the perfect summer popcorn movie; action thrills, big laughs, a likeable cast and brilliant visuals really allow it to recover from momentary snags and reach the finish line in splendour. Expertly crafted and with an unabashed sense of fun, Spider-Man: Far From Home is an assured Marvel instalment that hungers for a rewatch.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

The movie felt air-tight and didn't lag on with unnecessary scenes. Every scene felt important from a character or plot stand-point. It felt great to see another Marvel movie after the events of Endgame and Infinity War, and to see how the world learned to adapt and then re-adapt with the ""Bliped"" back in the world
The movie is pretty funny and had me laughing quite a lot. Of course this is thanks to the great character writing accompanied by great dialogue. Peter Parker and MJ's relationship felt so real and so awkward at times. The scene right before the Opera starts, you can really feel Peter's emotion and his want to not be spider-man and just be a normal high school kid. His dilemma of choosing Spider-Man to fill in Tony Stark's shoes, or just be a regular kid is quite daunting, and the audience relates to Peter when he finally does make a decision.
Mysterio being the villain was something in the works for a while, and it definitely payed off, because he was a really interesting vilian that could do a lot of Doctor Strange-esque things. This of course made the action really tripy while getting into the minds of the characters. At its very core, Mysterio is a lot like Syndrome from The Incredibles. He wants to be a super hero, so he creates his own villain that he knows he can destroy, so he looks good in the public eye. Syndrome in my opinion did this better, however Mysterio is still great and is definitely not just a Syndrome Knock off.
Overall, this movie felt much more alive and deep than its predecessor. And that's saying a lot, because I really liked Homecoming! The action was better, the villain was better, and the 2 twists in the credits get me really excited for what comes next in the MCU.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

Far From Home is the first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) since the recent double-whammy of Avengers movies changed the status quo forever.

Is the MCU running out of steam? It's a big burden for a relatively smaller film in the franchise to carry. But Far From Home does so very well by zeroing in on what has successfully fuelled the MCU thus far: prizing character development above all to tell a story that's as emotional as it is entertaining.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

283,6 July 2019,sophaljonesy,8," The best MCU Spiderman so far
","When Peter Parker decides to go on school trip to Europe and woo his crush MJ, what could go wrong? Well, being a Marvel superhero movie, you know he will have many comic moments with his teen friends and face a supervillain on the trip. However, despite the simple template, the movie delivers on many levels.
The first level is the plot. The story is interesting because Peter Parker has a character arc. Since his character debut in Civil War, Spiderman was a comically side-character. In Spiderman: Homecoming, Spiderman seemed more like a teen rom com lead with superpowers. However in this installment, we see Spiderman becoming a true hero who could rise up to an 'Avenger-level' threat on his own.
On the second level, there is the challenge. Marvel manages to keep the stakes high by having Spiderman struggle internally with what he wants to be and puts him to the ultimate test when he faces his real challenge. Here we see Spiderman get beaten and frightened. We also feel for him and wonder how he could rise above the challenge and defeat his nemesis.
On the third level, there is the cinematography. Though it can be argued that there is a lot of CGI, the choice of using swing shots to immerse with Spiderman's action actually works and provides both fun and thrills. Of course the aerial shots of different landscapes are great, and so are the creature effects for the Elementals.
On the fourth level, there is the side characters. Many side characters manage to shine and provide more than comic relief. We see Happy Hogan and Aunt May play roles as father and mother figures for Peter Parker. There is Nick Fury being the authoritative figure, and Ned the friendly, comically sidekick. There is also MJ, Peter's crush, who is more than just a damsel in distress.
In fact, these four reasons are enough for me to believe it the best MCU Spiderman movie. P.s. Don't forget to see the mid-credit and post credit scenes.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

","After seeing this movie I have to say Spider-Man keeps getting better and better. This movie gives us a breath of fresh air after Endgame left us exasperated and broken hearted. The humor is at its best here. I laughed almost the entire movie. The beginning brings us back to right where we left off explaining what happened after everyone returned from the snap. They call it the blip here. Spider-Man is still the local hero helping Aunt May raise money for charity. Marissa Tomei is still fantastic in the role. There was perfect amount of her and Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau). They have a budding relationship and it's very cute. I hope to see more of these two together in the future. Peter soon leaves for a school science trip overseas with his friends and hilarious teachers. Ned is amazing as always finding a girlfriend in Betty Brandt. They play up the super annoying high school/ first love relationship, To hilarious results. There is so many different kind of romantic entanglements in this film. All of which are very amusing. MJ and Peter have this great back and forth throughout the runtime of this film. Zendaya is very funny with the dry dark humor. I love her version of MJ. Having Nick Fury and Maria Hill back is familiar fun. Jake Gyllenhaal is really awesome as Mysterio. It's a different character than I'm used to him playing. But I loved it. Last but not least Tom Holland. He is my Spider-Man. He was born to play this role, it's quite obvious. Tom brings a beautiful sense of awkwardness, courageousness and pathos to the role. The movie's action is fast paced and fun. Although often times I wanted the action scenes to be over with so we could get back to the story. It had me so entangled. I hope a new Spider-Man comes soon. I want to know what happens next!!! I recommend you see this as quickly and as many times as possible.

But the role Stark-Tech ends up playing, and how Peter uses it, points in the opposite direction. Had the gadgets failed, leaving him with only his innate abilities, it might've been even stronger.

","Spider-Man: Far From Home is a fun MCU outing that surpasses its predecessor in almost every way. Tom Holland delivers his best performance as the titular superhero and his character arc and interesting and sets him up as the new lead for the MCU's next saga. Jake Gyllenhaal is an amazing new addition to the franchise as Mysterio. He's an interesting character, with compelling goals and one if the most creative schemes in the franchise. Samuel L Jackson is as amazing as always as Nick Fury and Jacob Batalon is hilarious and likeable as Ned Leeds. The movie has exciting action and some of the best visuals in the MCU. There is one scene halfway through the movie with such creative and beautiful visuals that you need to see it for yourselves. The humour is well executed and never feels forced which, as much as I love this franchise, is a common crime shared by several MCU films. I also strongly suggest that you all stick around after the movie ends, as the post credit scenes are some of the best and most shocking in the entire MCU.

","While the humor and the European setting is all great, it's rich and compelling storytelling along with great CGI that puts this new Spider-man venture far above its predecessors while also answering the many unanswered questions left by the magnum opus, Avengers: Endgame.
Right from the beginning itself, Peter is put under tremendous pressure of filling in the shoes of Tony Stark while also trying to fit in with everybody else who were left alive by the merciless decimation.
This movie really shows how dependent Peter was on Tony or how dependent the entire MCU was on Tony and the kind of impact it had on both the good and the bad guys. His decisions, his arrogant nature form the foundation of the main conflict and the way it still leaves poignant feel.
The European setting breathes a whole new life into the MCU, which had all its fight scenes either in New York or in a CGI battlefield.
Overall, the film delivers both as a conclusion to the 23 films long Infinity Saga and also as a foundation to the unforeseeable future of the MCU.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

The CGI is amazing, light years from its DC counterpart and I like the direction that the MCU takes Peter Parker towards and I can see how Spider-Man can carry the MCU for the next couple of years if Sony allows it. The only qualms I have with this movie was Peter and MJ's relationship towards the end. It felt too vanilla and Hollywood stereotypical. I would have preferred a Star Lord and Gamora type of relationship between them as that would have been more natural in the movie. MJ's subtle interest in Peter felt weird for me throughout the movie especially since she barely cared about him in the 1st movie.

It took a little bit for the movie to get going and for the jokes to begin to land for me, but it gave us one of the best villains in Mysterio as well as a coming of age story that also reminded us of the same ""horrors"" we all faced during high school.

433,2 July 2019,arskhemnanilack,8," Spider-Man: Far From Home - 8.7/10
","Homecoming was a great movie, and I'd been waiting for another film to see if the greatness of spider-man would remain and continue through the MCU. This movie definitely did the job in bringing my favourite actor to play spider-man yet to my redemption. This movie is yet again like Homecoming, the perfect summer movie. It's actually more fun than Homecoming because they're on a school trip and the comedy seems to just land a lot more for me. Jon Watts is also back to direct this one, and he did such a great job. There are many scenes that make me reminisce to certain spider-man things I just never thought I'd ever see on a movie screen. The CGI in this movie is incredible, and is uses so well other than 2-3 scenes. To continue the fact that Micheal Keaton played Vulture, another great actor, Jake Gyllenhaal did an incredible and outstanding job with his role in FFH. Mysterio is awesome and adds a lot to the franchise, with great action scenes. Zendaya's character wasn't so great in Homecoming, but she is in this movie and the interaction/chemistry between her and Tom are natural in the scenes they're in, especially towards the end. Tom Holland also reprises his role here of course as Peter Parker and does a great job again. Along with much of the other cast members such as Jon Favreau, Jacob Batalon, Samuel Jackson, Cobie Smoulders and Marisa Tomei do a great job and bring a lot to the table here especially towards the second half for most of them. I also feel that the story is good enough, with a few plot holes here and there though it still doesn't quite top the story in Homecoming. A few issues were that the first half feels more like a Peter Parker movie and the second half is very intense/feels like a spider-man movie. Some decisions and scenes are nonsensical and a few are just used to create comedy which I feel was unnecessary. The post credits scenes (there are 2) are really important in this movie so don't miss them. Overall, this is easily the best movie of the summer and is still an awesome time at the theater. It also feels like an amped up version of Homecoming. This movie is a better Spider-man film than Homecoming, with it's incredible action and higher stakes here in terms of the villain.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019
434,8 October 2019,phoenixinvictus,5," None of it makes sense
","What can I say about this movie? Well suspending belief is absolutely necessary because once Mysterio shows up... hoo boy-logic totally leaps off the cliff without a parachute or a bungee rope! Nick Fury and Maria Hill who are both intelligent agents (hahaha... intelligent... hahaha) investigate an unnatural storm and encounter the Earth Elemental. A guy who appears out of nowhere defeats this Elemental while Nick and Maria simply take his word and believe that he's from an alternate reality because... he wears a cape and has powers? Yeah, we'll go with that because... why not? Fury meets Parker while on vacation and gives him a pair of glasses that Stark bestowed to him which were meant for his successor. These glasses control a bunch of orbital weapons system's drones. Why Tony Stark would give this kind of power to a sixteen year old kid you might ask? Why indeed? Because he is responsible you might answer... Nope! No, no and no! He simply hands over the glasses to Mysterio who uses it to destroy London. I mean he literally hands over the glasses to a man he has only met for a few days! Why not hand them to Fury or another Avenger? Why didn't Tony give these glasses to Fury, or Thor or an adult with who has a drivers license or who is old enough to vote??? There is a reason why they don't give the nuclear launch codes to a bunch of six graders... they are emotionally immature and stupid. I'm left with the question is how did Mysterio know that Tony going to give a bunch of weapons of mass destruction to a teenager?",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

The things that happened in Endgame are really affecting the hero, and the whole movie addresses the theme of legacy. And oh boy, the visuals. I haven't felt that mesmerised by a movie's visuals since Doctor Strange.

","So, i was going into this movie hoping that it would be as good as homecoming.... and it was slightly better, here is why. also spoilers if you havent seen the movie.
1. tom holland. i cant stop talking about how awesome tom hollands spider man is, the other spider men were older and not very funny but tom holland captures the essence of peter parker, he i just perfect, he looks like a teenger and acts like a teenager would and even does somthing no other spider man did, he gave the character a queens accent, its someting very few people notice. but overal he is my favorite spider man.
2. it takes spider man out of new york. i loved that they took spidey to a new location for this movie. he had always been in new york and it was really cool to see him in a new setting.
3.jake gyllnhaal as mysterio. i loved jake as mysterio. his potrail as the character. it was somthing new and exciting and i loved the sort of mentor type relationship between peter and mysteiro.
4. the post credit scenes. the first post credit scene is where peter finds out that mysterio revealed his identity to the public and joe jonah jameson anounces it and he is played by none other then j.k simmons which will make fans of the sam rami spider man films go wild. and the second post credit scene it turns out that nick fury and maria hill are skrulls and shows that nick fury is up in space on a skrull ship probably helping them find a new home. and it expands the marvel universe with just that scene.
verdict. so if you are a spider man fan or a fan of the mcu you will probably like this movie, its fun, entertaining, and new. its a fresh take on the character and its a fun thrill ride that you could watch over and over. but if you were a fan of the rami films and are not looking foward to watching this you might like the first post credit scene and thats it. if you were a fan of marc webbs edgy spider man movies you wont like this because this is a funny movie that is very vibrent in many ways so you probably won enjoy this movie. if you are a casual movie go'er you will probably be very entertained and satisfied with this movie. so ill give it an A.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

","Now that I've seen it twice now and some time has passed. I can finally come to my final thoughts from my first viewing in theaters. Overall, Spider-Man Far From Home is a really good movie, it was funny entertaining, exciting, and charming. All the characters in this movie are great and given a lot more to do, everything involved with the villain is actually brilliant and way better than Homecoming, performances from everyone are wonderful, the story is funny, goofy but very self aware, entertaining, and engaging, the action scenes and the visual effects are super cool, there is tons of great subtle commentary, the soundtrack is still fantastic, and everything involved with Peter Parker and Spider-Man was great especially in the new direction they took him. But it has similar issues with Homecoming, the cinematography is a bit weak and I wish they highlighted the locations they went to more, not saying that it's bad at all but didn't really convey the tone that well. Characters like Brad and Nick Fury were pretty weak at points and kind of brought the movie a bit down at some scenes. And as for the last issue I have which is a personal thing and related to Homecoming, I wish the movie has a bit more heart. The biggest thing about the Sam Rami Spider-Man movies and even Spider-Man Into The Spider-Verse is that those movies have so much heart and even emotional scenes, and I felt that is what this movie and Homecoming needed is some emotional scenes and some heart. But I think the material and script are still there, and it's still a really good movie and it's still hilarious, and it always manages to capture why I love Spider-Man as a character and his connection with me. All it just needs is better cinematography and more heart, with more of those it could be a masterpiece and be up there with Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Verse possibly. In conclusion, the movie is really good, I enjoyed it a lot and I could see myself watching it again and still enjoying it, but it could have been a bit better, but at the end of the day it was trying to be a good movie and it succeeded.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

This acts as a great way to catch up with events so far in the grand narrative, we get shots of the snap from the perspective of average people, as well as everyone snapping back into existence suddenly. We get shown how some kids from the school have grown up five years while others are exactly where they were pre-snap, and how it's caused curricula mayhem. Rather than using some clunky exposition, or revealing the effects of the snaps gradually and naturally, I felt using the school's cheap news broadcast to bring the audience up to speed was probably the best and most entertaining way to go about it.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

","The more these movies become the Disney MCU and the less Marvel Studios (which I guess is only a name now), the less I like them. I can see how folks less concerned with my complaints could enjoy this movie. I just lament when thinking back to where Marvel Studios started. We're watching (and enjoying) the Toby Maguire Spiderman 2. Toby was a little old for the part but had the role down cold. A little bit of silly romance, a well-developed villain, good supporting roles (Incl J.K.), nice pacing. The world isn't facing destruction, you didn't have to see 4 other movies to understand it, Jon Favreau doesn't do an obligatory cameo nor Nick Fury, there's none of the stifling Disney idealogical and social twist, the plot makes sense and doesn't just fit the scene, and the CGI is as absolutely good as it has to be.

","I just watched Spider-man: Far from home in the theater today , it's safe to say that it's the best Spider Man Movie so far , it even tops the RAIMI's trilogy.
It was funny and emotional at the same time.
My mind was blown by Mysterio , I mean literally blown away. The director did a really good job .
Tom Holland's performance was his best so far, one might say that he's the best Peter Parker.
Jake Gyllenhaal's Performance was PHENOMENAL as always, He never disappoints.

It wasn't until 2008 when Robert Downey Jr (in the mother of all comebacks) set the ball rolling in Iron Man. And even then, we had no clue that that film would pilot an entire franchise to its grand finale a few months ago. Avengers: End Game, though epic in proportion and conclusion, did leave some lingering questions about the fate of many of the Avengers and the franchise itself. But now that the battle smoke has settled and along with it, the hype and anticipation too, Marvel fans can sit back and enjoy a superhero film that doesn't take itself too seriously.

Far from Home is brimming with a youthful energy, and features a few of the most elaborately-constructed action set-pieces ever before seen in a Spider-Man film.

Oh... My... God. This movie is a road trip to Europe, to the mind of Peter Parker and to the amazing world of Spider-Man. While having older values, like the villain's motives, it has fresh new amazing ideas stored for Peter. He has to deal with so many things in this movie, while this one being shorter than Homecoming. He has to deal with his love for MJ, the loss of his mentor Tony Stark, he has to protect his friends, his identity, deal with the villain who is totally out of his mind, and even has a weird situation with his Aunt May, and her new partner (even tho that's just a joke storyline). And that's what always made Peter's character so loveable for many, because he has to deal with everything in the same time.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

","I'm glad I saw Far From Home, not just because I love Spider-Man, but it also answered some things from Endgame, and serves as an aftermath for the previous film. Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio is easily the best part of this film. Despite me knowing mysterio was already a villain, I wasn't sure how they'd switch him from good to bad without it being cliché, and was pleasantly surprised. One problem I have is how close the camera is, since this movie is advertised for it's locations but we don't see much. I will say that even though Mysterio was entertaining, he wasn't as well written as the previous Spider-Man Vulture. The visuals are also great, and the music has an excellent score. What confuses me is with Spider-Man's first encounter with Mysterio and the first elemental, no one apparently recognizes him when he's just wearing some party mask.

The movie picks up shortly after Avengers: Endgame and does a good job at continuing the Marvel Cinematic Universe into it's next phase, paying homage to lost Avengers and moving forward with it's remaining characters. The movie is lighthearted and funny. Tom Holland (Peter Parker / Spider-Man) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Quentin Beck / Mysterio) carry the film with exceptional acting. Special effects were awesome, especially for Mysterio's bit. And you'll want to stay after the movie for two after-credit scenes. One is half way after the credits (having huge circumstances), and the other at the very end. Overall, I quite enjoyed the movie.

","To be honest, I've never interested in Marvel/the Avengers. Never bothered to keep up. Saw MCU as kind of 'overhyped', so when I decided to watch this, I wasn't expecting anything extravagant. And truthfully, when I rethink the whole script and plot, it's not too mindblowing. Classic ""hero's maturity/turning point"" kind of thing. However, the part where Happy said Tony Stark had never doubted his choice of choosing Peter-that really warmed my heart. Also, Mysterio had been fishy since the beginning. Either Peter's really that dumb not to notice how literally no one minded the fact that Quentin had his armored suit on when Mysterio was literally Talk of the World on TV at that moment or the scriptwriters just decided to play along with it because, hell, why not. Even when Peter had confirmed the transfer of EDITH to Quentin, he already sort of broke character? Like, from good guy to true bad guy self. Peter's kind of, really, oblivious. Even for a sixteen year old teenager. Even so, I was amazed by the usage of technology displayed in the movie-it was really cool and amazing.

Besides the story, Tom Holland is still potraying Peter Parker in a good way alongside the supporting role of the movie, especially Jon Favreau, Jacob Batalon, and Jack Gyllenhaal. I think Jon Favreau has better potrayal as Happy in this movie as he gave a better look as assistant/father figure who support Peter wherever and whenever he needs.

It needed to adress everything that happened after the first snap (or blip) and the following one, both from a worldwide view, and spiderman's, but some scenes still felt too stretched out and didnt seem to add much to the story.
Tom Holland, yet again, portrays spiderman as I have imagined him while reading the comics. It was a delight to get see him be an actual teenager dealing with loss and love. The rest of the cast was amazing especially when watching the movie a second time and picking up on little clues about the movies' twist ending (endings if we count the post credit scene).
The dialogue was a bit cheesy and predictable at points, a little lacking when compared to the witty writing I've gotten used to in the MCUs movies lately but the cinematography, score and special effects made up for it.

669,3 July 2019,phoenixlunapl,9," The movie that decieves
","When the movie starts out the spectator gets all there emotions back from the ending of Avengers: Endgame. The movie follows Peter Parker and his science class on their field trip around the world. The film does a great job of showing how a teenager in high school develops a crush and how nervous they are about being around that said person. When things start going well, a villain appears and Peter Parker must work with a new hero that people name ""Mysterio."" The movie does a great job of keeping the watcher sucked into the screen with constant, well timed humor and heart-tugging moments. Once you feel like the movie should be coming to an end, you look at your watch and realize you're only an hour in. That is when the movie has a brilliant plot twist and everything you thought you knew about the movie was just an illusion. (For those of you who have seen the movie enjoy that awful pun.) As characters get reestablished in their roles, the spectator has more thrills, suspense, and bliss as the story actually begins to unfold. If you compare this movie to the previous Endgame or Infinity War, you might be disappointed with the lack of other Marvel characters. If you watch the movie as another Spider-Man movie, you will be very impressed and grateful you took time out of your day to watch this film. Everything in the movie is never what it seems and will keep you wanting to know what happens next.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

673,26 July 2019,ojoon,10," A Marvel movie that does justice to Spider-Man, Peter Parker and teenagers
","I'm gonna say something controversial, I don't like Spider-Man : Homecoming, it's borderline painful to watch, not even gonna lie, Spider-Man playing a layman's version of himself, with the rest of the movie saddled with tiring battle scenes and teenage incense that isn't really all that charming, yeah, the predecessor improves like a dent on a tin can, like it isn't even visible anymore.
Spider-Man : Far From Home could potentially be one of the best movies of the year, I mean, it already is the best movie of 2019 so far, in my humble opinion, of course.
There's literally nothing to contravene here, it's the perfect superhero flick, with adrenaline pumping battle scenes, twists that doesn't sell themselves too much, three dimensional characters, all juxtaposed against a youthful glow that shines throughout the movie.
In this sequel, we see a Peter Parker that's more competent, more grounded and less heavy handed with his missions.
Ever since that tragic passing of Tony Stark aka Iron Man in Avengers : Endgame, you can tell that there's real pressure being ingressed in Peter's vernal cranium, he can't take all the responsibilities being pressed against him, and that despite all his powers and the stakes he's gone through as a superhero whom millions of kids look up to as their afflatus, he's still no less coequal to all of them, only with superpowers.
Throughout the movie, we get to see him struggle with his moonlighting as Spider-Man and putting that on the same equilibrium with his life as a regular 16 year old teenage kid who only wants to propose to the girl of his dreams and hang out with his friends.
And, I won't lie, that made me felt that, like, I relate to that.
It's not nice living in two worlds and also living up to everybody's expectations, and the movie executes that turmoil arduously and adroitly.
The rest of the characters, such as Mysterio, who is devilishly tricky with a working twist to his character, is responsible for some of the best special effects in the movie, just as long as you are not faint-hearted to see poor Spider-Man being tossed around in his illusions in one scene, MJ straddles the line between being charming and arrogant and her burgeoning romance with Peter Parker, who couldn't muster the courage to wear his heart on his sleeves, ends up with a cute result when they kiss in the end, the same can be said for the rest of the romance here, the bubbly relationship between Peter's friend, Ned and his girl is as frivolous and tounge-in-cheek as it is meaningful, where the meaning is that, when you drift apart with someone you love, those memories that you share together, will stay in each of you, and, I'm not mincing words here, the romance factor in the movie is highly welcomed and appreciated, it's cute, it's funny, it's relatable, it's making me giddy.
Flash also gets to shine, it's always nice to see a bully being bullied, and that's why he is such a delight to watch, the two bumbling teachers that's present on the children's road trip also supplies enough inane humor, and of course, Nick Fury, who's laid back and weary as ever.
The sense of humor shouldn't be overlooked as well as the unexpected quips, one-liners and awkward exchange in conversations just keeps on coming out like a spider's web.
From the weird romance between Ned and his girl, to Happy confessing his love for Aunt May in a tense situation, a reference to Power Rangers and Voltron Force when describing Mysterio's DIY apparitions, all the way to the Spidey sense being ""upgraded"" to the Peter tinkle, the movie hardly ever gets boring and it entertains regardless of what's going on in the movie.
As a whole, Spider-Man : Far From Home is a ridiculously fun popcorn fodder with tense action scenes, clever twists, amazing display of charisma from all the characters, along with romance that's actually cute, relatable and harmless, instead of the amorous vibes we get from The Amazing Spider-Man movies, yeah, Spider-Man : Far From Home is one of the best superhero movies in a long time, and without a doubt, I'm calling it, the best Spider-Man movie, hands down.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

696,3 July 2019,Cineanalyst,8," Multiverse Allusions and Illusions
","It took 23 movies, but the Marvel Cinematic Universe finally has a thoroughly self-reflexive entry with ""Spider-Man: Far From Home,"" and it's clever enough to make this one of the best of the entire series. In more ways than one, ""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019) irrevocably altered the universe. The introduction of time travel--which allowed the movie to revisit and annotate prior MCU entries--already pointed the way for the movie-within-a-movie concept employed here. And, indeed, much of this one is spent ruminating over the fallout of ""Endgame."" The antagonist, Mysterio, is at the center of this construction; he uses an image projection system to create illusions--essentially, he directs a movie-within-a-movie, for what is cinema, especially one as laden with CGI and fantastic superhuman characters, if not an illusion. Like other MCU movies, Mysterio's projections involve destroying whole cities as spectators look on with awe. This isn't the usual silly alien invasion fluff. It's a movie versus a movie within. And no hero in the MCU is better equipped for this allusive turn than the ""really old""-movie-referencing web-slinger Spiderman. Heretofore merely concerned with being a local hero of reflecting similar films that came before him--""your friendly neighborhood Spiderman,"" who, say, would run through backyards like in ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" (1986)--he's now fully invested in meta cinematic universe building.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

The scale of the movie is perfect! It ties well into the MCU while simultaneously making for a great stand alone film, though fans unfamiliar with Iron Man will miss out on some of the more emotional points. My favorite aspect is the high school drama/MJ romance. Peter has to make hard decisions and work through his priorities as he's being pulled in 2 directions. He's funny, awkward, quirky, passionate, and kicks butt as Spider-Man.

","The film tells the story of the events after the Avengers: Endgame. Everywhere was Tony Stark because Peter was incredibly respected and loved him. Naturally, it is normal that Tony Stark's absence is brought to our eyes throughout the film. Even at the first opening of the film, the losses of the Avengers are shown and there is a pleasant sympathy. Peter's loss of his mentor affects his powers, leading him to difficult times. The film successfully manages to reflect this trauma. You're experiencing Peter's pain exactly. After many people disappeared for five years because of Thanos, the world is naturally in recovery. While some people have not aged in any way, some have lost five years of their lives.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

","High school square Peter Parker and his Midtown Science classmates find themselves in a conundrum as what technically amounts to their junior year is taking place in a world that's forever changed. Although still grieving the loss of his mentor, Peter plans to put the heroics on hold, enjoy a class trip abroad, and spend time with the girl that he likes. Upon arriving at his destination, Peter's plan becomes a secondary concern when Nick Fury summons him to team up with master illusionist Quentin Beck and take on elemental threats, but is Peter ready to step up and take on the responsibilities of being a full-time Avenger? Because it exists on a smaller scale than some of the previous Marvel films it doesn't quite have that same sense of anticipation, and gets off to a bit of a slow start, but director Watts still has some tricks up his sleeve and finds the right tone, makes his characters engaging, and takes the story in unexpected directions so as not to completely rehash what he accomplished in Homecoming. Holland effectively conveys all of his character's conflicting priorities, with quality support from Jackson, Favreau, and Gyllenhaal. The biggest complaints are that the action scenes are a bit overdone, and there's too much plot exposition at times, but there's also juicy tidbits for MCU followers moving forward. **½",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

","First thing to say is Tom Holland IS Spider-Man! I loved Toby Maguire back in the day, I even thought Andrew Garfield brought a refreshing slant to the character, after Toby's bad 3rd film. But Tom embodies Spider-Man, you really believe he's Him.
And his supporting cast, Aunt May, Happy and classmates are well up for the job, May and Happy's dynamic worked well and added something Marvel has been missing lately in the, all encompassing, run up to Endgame. Jake is very good, as always, but you feel like he is let down by how is character is written. His character is not really allowed to truly let rip in the way you seem to get the impression he would, I wonder if just one film for this character isn't really enough for us to have got the full benefit out of it.
This is very much a stand alone film in many ways, managing to bridge the huge gap left after Endgame in a way that feels right for characters like Ironman, and fair to people that got Blipped back. The worlds changed unimaginably in someways, but nice to know a boy still fancies a girl; and when your a teenager that takes over your world whatever is happening.
You almost want to think that a stand alone ""small"" story wasn't enough after the huge run up to Infinity War and Endgame, but it actually manages to do it so well it really does feel like the end of ""Phase 4"", with the two end credits scenes giving a glimpse into the future of the MCU and how Spider-Man is going to possibly fit in that new world.
After the death of Ironman you wonder who could fill his shoes, the set up is clear they currently want it to be Spider-Man and with this film we see that Tom's Spider-Man could possibly do it.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

One of the most interesting things it has done, is introduce the father figure/mentor relationship between peter and tony stark. With the death of stark this leaves a whole for the leader of the Avengers. This is one of the main driving forces of this film but it also does a good job of not taking over the whole plot of the film. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Mysterio is fantastic and it's a shame there's a good chance we won't be seeing him again. This movie has plenty of action and is also funny, but not too much comedy so that it takes away believability, something that has been a problem in the more recent entries of the MCU.

","I've heard a lot of people praising this film as the best spider-man movie. I'm not quite there. I think it's a very entertaining film, but not quite top tier spider-man. This is a movie that does a great job of bridging the gap between endgame and this film. They found some really clever ways to inform us of what's been going on in ways that are funny, but also make it really clear the dynamics of the world that we're in in the type of scernarios that would have unfolded. This is also a very funny film. One of the funniest films in the MCU. Likewise each of the action sequences in this film have something distinct and unique about it that makes them interesting and memorable, especially the one that happens at the SHIELD base. That is a very cool sequence and unlike anything we've seen inside a spider-man film or a comic book movie in general. Where this one started to lose me a little bit was somewhat in the villain situation. In general there's great things that happen with the villain in this film, but at the same time I think there's a motivation problem. There's a gap inside of the motivation that held him back a good bit for me. Likewise a certain plot device inside of the film stretched a little bit too much credibility. Also this feels a bit more like an MCU comedy with spider-man in it than an actual spider-man movie.

",I thoroughly enjoyed this film and it's definitely the best spider-man film to be made with homecoming coming very close. This movie was an excellent continuation of the mcu saga and it did very well in that regard. It nicely tied up the loose ends about endgame and it's definitely the epilogue endgame deserved. It did not rely too much on endgame but rather it's about Peter Parker getting along without iron man which is a difficult journey for Peter but he manages to find his way throughout the movie.,/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

","Avengers: Endgame may have concluded the ongoing Avengers story that gradually developed since Iron Man, the first movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but that doesn't mean it will not continue with further films, this was the next instalment. Basically, in Mexico, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) are investigating an unnatural storm, and encounter the Earth Elemental, extradimensional creatures that use natural forces. A super-powered man, Quentin Beck (Jake Gyllenhaal), arrives to fight the creature. In New York City, the Midtown School of Science and Technology restarts its academic year to accommodate the students who were among those who disappeared in ""the Blip"" eight months ago. The school organises a two-week summer field trip to Europe. Peter Parker (Tom Holland), who is still distraught over the death of Tony Stark, is planning to confess his growing feelings for classmate Michelle ""MJ"" Jones (Zendaya), and he wants to take a break from heroics. Dressed as Spider-Man, Peter is forewarned by Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau), at a charity fundraiser organised by his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), that he will be contacted by Fury. Peter chooses to ignore this, he leaves the event after being overwhelmed with questions about Tony Stark. Peter and his friends travel to Venice, where the Water Elemental strikes and wreaks havoc on the city, until Beck arrives and destroys the creature. Fury meets with Parker, he wants his help, and gives him Stark's glasses. The glasses are equipped with the artificial intelligence E.D.I.T.H. (which stands for Even Dead I'm The Hero) (voiced by Dawn Michelle King), which has access to all databases of Stark Industries and commands a large orbital weapons supply. Beck, who adopts the nickname ""Mysterio"", says he is from a different reality, one of many in the Multiverse, and he claims the Elementals killed his family. Peter rejects Fury's call to help Mysterio, opting to rejoin his class, but Fury covertly redirects the school trip to Prague, where the Fire Elemental is projected to strike. The creature appears at a carnival, Beck is eventually able to defeat it with the help of Spider-Man. Fury and Hill invite Parker and Beck to Berlin to discuss the formation of a new superhero team. Peter believes Beck is more worthy of being Stark's successor, and bequeaths him the E.D.I.T.H. glasses. But it is revealed that Beck is a former holographic-illusions specialist at Stark Industries, he was fired for his unstable nature. He leads a team of other disgruntled ex-Stark employees, using advanced projector drones they are simulating the Elemental attacks so Mysterio can masquerade as a hero. Intending to tell MJ his feelings for her, she assumes Peter is going to tell her that he is Spider-Man, which she already realised. MJ shows Peter a piece of debris she retrieved during the carnival battle, it is a projector that presents a simulation of the Air Elemental, they realise that Beck is a fraud. Peter travels to Berlin and meets with Fury, only to realise that it is an illusion created by Beck, this leads to a battle with multiple illusions before Fury apparently subdues Beck. Fury forces Peter to reveal anyone he told about Beck's deception, but this is revealed as another illusion. Peter is hit and badly injured by a train, falling unconscious he eventually waking in a jail cell in the Netherlands. Peter breaks out and contacts Hogan, who flies Peter to London, while a machine left by Stark synthesizes a new customized Spider-Man costume. In London, Beck uses E.D.I.T.H. to orchestrate his biggest illusion yet, a fusion of all four Elementals, and he plans to kill MJ and any others who know his secret. Peter breaks through the illusion, regains control of E.D.I.T.H., and defeats Mysterio. Beck ends up killed by a misfired drone gunshot. Parker returns to New York City and begins a relationship with MJ. Spider-Man and MJ are seen together in Times Square, then on a big screen is an announcement by reporter J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) of TheDailyBugle, he blames Spider-Man for the Elementals' attacks. He then plays pre-recorded footage of Beck, who incriminates Peter for his death and then reveals his secret identity. It is also revealed Skrulls Talos (Ben Mendelsohn) and Soren (Sharon Blynn) have been masquerading as Fury and Hill the whole time, so that Fury can relax on a spaceship. Also starring Jacob Batalon as Ned Leeds, Tony Revolori as Flash Thompson, Angourie Rice as Betty Brant, Remy Hii as Brad Davis, J.B. Smoove as Mr. Dell, Martin Starr as Mr. Harrington, Jorge Lendeborg Jr. as Jason Ionello, Numan Acar as Dimitri, and Claire Rushbrook as Janice. British-born Holland reasserts himself as a spirited and wise-cracking hero, Jackson is both commanding and amusing as the Avengers boss, Gyllenhaal does well as the anti-hero, and Zendaya remains amusingly snidey as Spidey's love interest. The story is essentially Spider-Man battling evil whilst globetrotting, it is nice to see European sites along the way, the script is filled with wittiness and humour, and the special effects are jaw-dropping and add a lot to proceedings, it is a little by-the-book, but a satisfying superhero fantasy action adventure.

","I'm having problems with the marvel universe. I think they're a victim of their own success, be that they can throw any film in a can and it'll be great. Not true. This was the kind of movie, like several of Marvel's recent entries, that if I never see again, I won't care. There are some good things:
The Good - Peter & MJ. Nice chemistry and they seemed like awkward teens. The rest of the cast was decent as well.
Mysterios suit. Other than the unnecessary lightning, this was really close to the comic.
EDITH - hysterical. Really funny.
The Bad - the story was clunky. Why did they have to go to Europe? This could have happened in America. It's not like they did anything special on the continent.
Spideys suits. What's wrong with the original? These are all ugly.
Stark. First, can killing him was a damn bad idea. Now, even dead here dominated the movie. The title is Spider-Man, not tony Stark and Spiderman. Also, have any of these screenwriters read any Spidey comics? He's self taught. No mentor. Next movie, stop with the world saving and get Spidey back down to earth.

","I do not work for Disney, but I suspect that they do not plan to stop making billions from their Marvel rights just yet; so while Endgame felt like a conclusion, certainly it is nothing of the sort. Far From Home is a well placed product then, much like Ant-Man and The Wasp was a bit of an amuse-bouche in the series, so too is this film a bit of a good old return to a smaller but engaging adventure. The plot sees Peter Parker trying to ignore the weight on hi and just enjoy an European vacation, although an interdimensional threat called an Elemental seems poised to disrupt all that.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

That said, this movie is a lot of fun, and a feast for the eyes. Sure, if you knew the characters from the comics, you will not be surprised by the twist in the tale, and even if you didn't know them from the comics, you'll feel the twist coming from a mile away.

","Spidy has always been my favorite hero, I grew up watching the cartoons in the 90s. What I loved about him that he was a troubled student, always trying his best, was never perfect and was always good. Smart, kind, witty and good. He did always solve his problems and defeat villains with the most developed muscle of his body: his brain. That's what's been missing from ALL Spiderman movies. Tobey Maguire's trilogy was good, we loved seeing the Spiderman swinging from the buildings in the big screen for the first time, it was such a rush. But I always thought he was too good looking to be Spiderman. And his version of Spiderman was way more socially awkward than it's supposed to be. I'm gonna call it: The character was written as stupid, barely showed any sign of mediocre intelligence. Third movie just made it unbearable with the terrible haircut and acting.
Tom's Spiderman is a win from these perspectives: He's smart, he's not strikingly good-looking (you need to pay attention to see his beauty) and he's not a desperate loser in his social life.
In the final fight against Mysterio (what a terrific performance from Jake Gyllenhaal), when Spidy ran out of webs, he quickly made a plan with what's available, made a small experiment, then created his own bomb to take down the drones, yes that was my favorite part of the movie. Spidy going sciency...
Marvel cinematic universe has stayed true to the core of Spidy's character while updating his social life with friends from diverse backgrounds (and gave aunt May a face lift). Yes Iron Man played a much bigger role in the movies than it's supposed to be, but we can give the multi billion dollar franchise a pass for trying to keep the universe plausible and integrated.
I also liked the new approach on MJ, an intelligent, grunge girl who is acquainted with the unbearable lightness of being... Loved her t-shirts!
Now he's been called-out by his worst enemy, JJ Jonah, I can't wait to see a slightly mature and confident Spidy, hated by the press, taking down bad guys with his never ending fight chatter :)) I hope despite the big reveal, they can somehow manage to keep his identity secret though... Him trying to do his best, but failing to be there for the people he loves because he's saving the city, was such an integral part of Spidy's story and was the essential source of conflict in his social life...

Nevermind the fact he can't fight too hard because his friends will see him in Europe which, happens at the end -- ugh. So the idea he was recruited for this mission was glaring. Mysterio was imho, bad. He had no real motivation other than a thin one the writers gave him and then, also, his plan made no sense. Apparently the plan is to fool the world into thinking he was a super hero. Well, what happens when a real super bad guy comes and or any old disaster at all? Nick Fury was utterly wasted here. Yes we find out later he might not be what he seems but the character was off the entire movie so that is uncomfortable. This movie was a first draft of a movie. Perhaps hastily put into production or left vague due to endgame. IMHO this was the first crack in the armor of Marvel.

Jake Glyenhall as always delivers an enigmatic and yet relatable Mysterio - as someone who is recovering from professional setbacks and an increasingly changing world with a thirst to prove himself. Jackson's Nick Fury is back in full form backed by Agent Hill. To add to the classic feel, we also have our first look at Mary Jane, who forms a major part of the entire narrative. To add to the already stunning VFX and loads of high end technology which the movie propagates, we have the 'Elementals' , entities from a different dimension, with of course a great inclination to destroy Earth.

In keeping with the PG rating, the scenes of mass destruction are essentially bloodless and usually peppered with cute 'quips' from Spiderman or his various school chums.

","Spiderman Far from Home is a really great film. Watching this movie, I enjoyed how suspenseful, action-packed and interesting it was. The special effects were fantastic especially during certain scenes. Some scenes that display this can be found when Peter uses EDITH, when Mysterio uses Illusions against Peter and the major battle against the drones and of course when Spiderman uses his awesome abilities. Some other scenes where this evident include the time when Spiderman creates a new suit from Stark's technology. It also gives a nice sequel to End Game. Plot twists and unusual surprising occurrences also play a big role in the movie as well. For example, when it is revealed that Mysterio is not who he says he is and the audience sees he is actually a bad guy working to exact vengeance. Instead of helping the world, he wants to destroy it and then get the credit for being a fake hero.
Watching this movie, I totally thought Mysterio was similar to Ironman and I was actually very surprised to find that he was not a hero, but a fake pretending to be a hero and look like an Avenger when he really is not. I definitely did not expect him to have a reason to exact vengeance on Tony Stark. I kind of feel bad for the fact that all Mysterio wanted was recognition and no body listened to him.

Looking forward to your next feature. This film doesn't have bad language, sex scenes, deplorable foul dialogue, crassness, sophomoric themes and has a great storyline. I hope you are planning a follow up film with the same high standard of entertainment.
I hope it makes huge sums of money so Hollywood can be inspired again not to put out the same tired old films and storyline.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019
999,3 July 2019,peeedeee-94281,3," Most of these 9 and 10 Reviews Were Written By Mysterio
","After the enjoyable Captain Marvel and epic Avengers: End Game, I was expecting Marvel to keep the bar set high with the post-Infinity Stone adventure. Boy was I wrong!
Okay, first off, there is absolutely no chemistry between Peter Parker and his apparent love interest MJ. I don't feel any reason to root for either party to get together, it just seems like a dull plot point.
Second, I wasn't familiar with Mysterio, so I was expecting something bigger. I did know he pretends to be a good guy, and then turns. But wow, a disgruntled Stark employee? lol that was pretty bad. Not engaging or interesting in the least.
Then there was the humor, or attempts at it. Every line had to be a joke. Over and over, it got really tiresome.
The trickery and illusions also got tiresome. One thing that bothered me is that if they figure out Quentin is using special effects and holograms to distract and hurt Spider-man, why didn't they create special polarized spectacles or goggles for Spider-man?
Lastly, when you stay to the very end credits, the last scene is like a slap in the face. But it also points to a huuuuge fault in the film. So if they were testing Spider-man by having him fight Mysterio solo, and the real Nick Fury was lounging on vacation somewhere, what if Spider-man ended up getting hurt or killed? And why was Fury willing to let innocent people to get killed? At least we know why no other Avenger shows up in this film to help out Spider-man, but the reason for it seems really really lame.
Overall, a really disappointing entry into the Marvel universe. Some have said this is taking us into the new direction. Frankly, it seems like it's put it into FULL STOP.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

","First of I would like to say I really enjoyed this movie. Spider-Man was great, the amount of Spider-Man used in the film especially the second half was great. Mysterio was great, perfect casting for the role. The only negative about this film is the pacing of the film. The Raimi films had much better pacing and things weren't happening all over the place and that's something I would've loved for this movie. The movie felt a bit short and things were happening very fast, like the beginning of the movie everything just happens so quick and you just have to accept it. The soundtrack was great, but sometimes not too great with action sequences. Where is the soundtrack for the intro though?? Doesn't feel like a Spider-Man movie without that theme at the beginning with opening logo's. Anycase the film was great, but I wanted it to be spectacular!

In the beginning, it had a hilarious memoriam for the superheroes we lost in endgame, and they continue throughout the movie to dramatically and hilariously talk about the effects of both ""infinity war"" and ""endgame."" One example of this would be where half of the High schoolers are five years older than the other half of the High schoolers. If they disappeared during the events of ""Infinity War"" and ""Endgame,"" they would call it being ""Blipped."" Another example of a reference to endgame was Iron Man's death. His death developed Peter into his own sort of Iron Man. He even got Iron Man's glasses. In one scene, there is also a reference to the first Iron Man movie, so if you haven't seen that, you should see it before you go see Far From Home.
Now to tell you if this movie is kid friendly.

","Once again, a treason to the comics presenting a portrayal of an irresponsible and unmature Parker (especially after 'Infinity War'/'Endgame' events) and because of the effort of having to exist under the shadow of Tony Stark rather than on his own. I know I liked or even loved other Marvel movies that changed the roots of the comics sources completely (Black Widow, Thor Ragnarok). But I think that movies, even with the changes, respected their main characters enough to keep them on their own. Spiderman is an awesome and rich character. And that richness is being missed in Holland's tenure. I think he's a good actor, but the script and the portrayal of his character is not. Once again, the proof of the need to back him movie after movie: the upcoming third installment...

1066,1 July 2019,Thekeybaldemasterrises,6," The mid credits scene is the best part I'm not sure if that's a good thing...
","Spider-Man Far From Home is a very middling Marvel movie. It's not bad, FAR FROM it..... But I wanted so much more. Tom Holland is giving his best performance as Peter yet(obviously besides his traumatic exit in Infinity War). He's able to hold his own in a movie that requires so much from his character, especially in a post Endgame world. Zendaya is doing great as MJ, and I was really digging the scenes with her and Peter together. The European vacation backdrop makes for a fresh Spidey story, and we get pretty fun set pieces as a result. I was also satisfied with the way they brought Mysterio to life, it was a clever and realistic take on the character, and I thought that part was visually fun. When it came to his character backstory though, that's where the issues began. Jake Gyllenhaal did fine with what he was given, but the way the character was introduced in terms of MCU building felt so tired and more of the same. Especially after coming off the Vulture in Homecoming. Story choices like this just made the movie way too predictable, and I had this feeling of ""Let's get on with it"" constantly nagging me. The comedy fell a little flat too, because it just spoke more like a Teen genre movie and not an MCU movie. The teen aspect is fine, because Jon Watts knows how to direct a good flick about coming of age in the 2010's, and that's why this Spider-Man has been so successful, because it stays relevant with today's generation. But I think my biggest issue with this take is the teen comedy genre is where the focus is, and not enough on Spider-Man. Holland's version of Peter Parker isn't being challenged enough and I don't feel enough emotional stakes in his story that even the Andrew Garfield movies do a better job portraying. It's hard not to talk about this more in detail without spoilers but let's be clear, if you enjoyed Homecoming and love all the Marvel movies then you'll like this one too. I will totally see it again just to see if I missed something, but as of right now, it's ok. Even though I liked Homecoming better I still really look forward to where they take things thanks to a very spicy mid credits scene, but it was at the cost of a mixed movie. 7/10.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

Granted, ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is a tough act to follow. Director Jon Watts' 2017 film was a giddy blast of New York City summertime air, a refreshing reboot with a hugely appealing star turn from Tom Holland in the title role. ""Far From Home"" also arrives about six months after the game-changing, Oscar-winning animated film ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,"" perhaps the most inventive movie we've seen yet inspired by a Marvel comic-or any comic, for that matter. In that regard, ""Far From Home"" works best as a high school comedy-which also happened to be the strength of ""Spider-Man: Homecoming""-with teens figuring out in adorably awkward fashion who they are and how to express what they feel within this brave new world. Peter has had a taste of the big time, with all the rush and responsibility that entails, but he just wants to be a normal teenager. He'd rather join his classmates on a summer European adventure-especially the darkly alluring MJ, played once again with humorous, deadpan charm by Zendaya-than save the world from total destruction. Again. And who could blame him? It's a lot-for him, and for us. Perhaps his true superpower is the fact that he seems more like a relatable, fully fleshed-out human being than any other character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Surely, we'll have a multitude of chances to find out for sure. But once again, he's completely charming in the role, bringing a boyish enthusiasm that's irresistible and wholly different from the ways Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield played him in previous incarnations. His Peter even gets to show glimmers of being a flaky kid as he dodges calls from an increasingly, amusingly frustrated Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson).",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

","Peter Parker is...far from home. As in, he's in Europe on a school science trip over the summer. Also as in, he's no longer in metaphorical Kansas and has to do some quick growing up after the death of his mentor and father figure, Tony Stark. But it seems that destruction follows Peter no matter where he goes, and this time it's attacks by ""elemental entities"" (in the forms of fire, earth, wind, and water monsters). But never fear, because Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) is here! Mysterio is a mysterious (heh) dude from an alternate Earth whose entire family was wiped out by these elementals, so he has an axe to grind. Nick Fury reels Spider-man in to help Mysterio, but poor Spidey would rather stay on his class trip and put the moves on MJ (Zendaya). Torn between a sense of duty and the wish to be a normal-ish teen, Peter tries to have it both ways, and that hardly ever works out well. This latest entry into the Marvel movie world is agreeably entertaining and a fun follow-up to this year's Endgame, even if it takes a little while to really get going. But once it does, look out! As Spider-man, Tom Holland is even better than he was in Homecoming, which is saying something. Holland's Spidey, unlike previous iterations of the superhero, doesn't come off as mopey or whiny but rather sincere and legitimate. We all know how honest and righteous Spider-man is, but Holland provides some needed color and dimension to that characterization. Samuel L. Jackson is fine as crusty, cranky Nick Fury, but for me Gyllenhaal felt a bit out of place as the charismatic Mysterio. On a younger note, both Zendaya (MJ) and Jacob Batalon (Ned) are terrific as Peter's friends, and Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) and Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) make for a nice, if temporary, couple.

","Yes it has its fair share of plot holes, and still doesn't manage to beat Raimi's legendary sequel to the original Spider-Man (2002) but Spider-Man Far From Home is an incredibly entertaining, fun, and surprisingly heartfelt little adventure that truly solidifies actor Tom Holland in the role of a lifetime. First off, i'll start with the films flaws. There are two twists throughout this film that seem more for shock value than being actually well thought out, and its apparent how lazily executed some moments of it can be at times. We also have some typical cliches here and there, more for the relationship plotline throughout the film rather than the actual hero one, that can be a bit tiresome. Besides that though, I thoroughly enjoyed this film for what it was. Its story has its faulty moments, but it's endlessly interesting throughout, and surprisingly very funny and moving at times. It does a great job of moving along the franchise to something new while also focusing on its inspirations from the past, not to mention the Mysterio nightmare sequences are incredibly well done. Jon Favreau is also a lot better in this film as Happy than the one before it, and adds a much needed comedic element to the film that I honestly appreciated a lot throughout. The rest of the cast is fine, nothing special, Jake Gyllenhaal definitely could have been better, but part of that is also due to its underwriting of character development. Zendaya does do a decent job as well as Jacob Batalon as Peter's friend Ned. In the end, it may not be totally original or the best Spider-Man out there, but it is a solid effort- flaws and all- and makes for quite an entertaining and memorable ride.

My main complaint is the post-end credit scene where Spiderman's identity was revealed, it's a spoiler, but if you haven't seen the movie, keep it like that, no sane person should enjoy this movie. This movie truly proves that they will waste no time making unnecessary sequels and earning money. As someone who wants to make movies, it comforts me knowing that if I make a movie, it can't do worse than movie like this.

1145,26 October 2019,ironhorse_iv,8," Spiderman, Spiderman, does whatever a spider can! Spin a web any size! Catch thieves just like flies! Look out, here comes the Spiderman! Truly this is one film worth looking
","Honestly to tell you the truth. I was really getting superhero fatigue before going into this film directed by Jon Watts. I thought I was done with seeing Marvel Cinematic Universe movies after seeing 2019 'Avengers: Endgame'. After all, 22 superheroes flicks from Marvel Studios with three featuring Peter Parker Aka Spiderman (Tom Holland) with two other movie series featuring the web-slinger played by other actors produced by Sony can be too much. Nevertheless 'Spiderman: Far from Home' got some of my Spidey senses tingling when it was announced that one of my favorite comic book individuals, Quentin Beck Aka Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) was going to be in the motion picture fighting along with the Web-Head against Elementals throughout Europe. Without spoiling the film too much, for the most part, I was not disappointed even if the baby face to heel is highly predictable and obvious to anybody who readt the comics. While the clichés battle scenes in the beginning with the CGI heavy elementals felt a bit recycled, after subsequently after watching similar action sequences from 2007 'Spider-Man 3'. The later fights got very interesting and clever with the villain feeding on the Webslinger's fears of trying to live up to his mentor. The continuous illusions were visually stunning and super creepy and chilling at the same time. On the edge of my seat throughout the whole time. Well Shot. I also dig that Parker in this movie has more character depth, besides the fact that Pete is an outsider in high school with common coming to age issues like trying to get with a girl and being popular in school. Yet, the point that the villain has more of a grudge against Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) than the title character, makes Spiderman seem secondary. Even without Robert Downey Jr. it's still the Iron Man show. Nevertheless, it was still a great way to reconnect some of the loose ends establish from 2016 'Captain America: Civil War' like the BARF concept. However, the whole manipulative plan seem a bit unrealistic. There is no way, it can perfectly be control to a tee like that. Outsider forces will clearly interfere. Although silly, the Stark-like millionaire playboy mannerism from Gyllenhaal & lost boy seeking father figure look from Holland made those conflicts seem semi genuine and intense. Both also did a hell of a job with their physic and mental performances. As for the supporting cast, I found the classmates of Peter to be less annoying than the last movie. Characters like Michelle Jones (Zendaya) really got better as her depressing persona died down a bit. She was mostly lovely in this film and more like the spitfire that MJ was in the comics. I just wish the filmmakers had the balls to make the character's hair red. If not, establish Mary Jane Watson as quickly as possible. As for Ned Leeds (Jacob Batalon), he is delightful with his limited role. He was indeed funny. As for the rest of the current roster of Midtown School of Science and Technology's Academic Decathlon team, they were fine even if the concept of visiting common tour sites in Europe doesn't make sense with what they're supposedly learning in school. It's also very strange that the group was rarely affected by 'the Blip AKA the Snap'. None of them has aged five years or seem to have any trauma. To tell the truth, the whole world seem pretty fine after half the world population return from the dust. You would think things would be more chaotic than a brief mention of homelessness problems likes urban and biological decay, resources shortages and economic and political collapse during that time period. The world should look more apocalyptic. Nevertheless, I really didn't like how the film made the snap seem like a joke. The tongue in cheek 'In Memorial' slideshow in the beginning kinda ruin the serious impact of the last movie. As for the other humor involving the teen situation comedy road trip & Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury popping up at times was alright for what it is. Even the odd love affair between Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) & Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) were decent enough to watch even if 'hot may' jokes were so yesteryear. Nevertheless, Marvel Studio's utter refusal to reuse the same Uncle Ben's narrative is getting pretty jarring. As for the final post credits sequences containing a multitude of mind blowing Easter eggs and cameo moments. The whole feeding the sequel narrative of 2019 'Captain Marvel' was confusing but interesting. Yet I found J. Jonah Jameson's appearance to be best. Glad to see J.K Simmons return to the role. It felt special. Sadly, the film does not contain an appearance by writer Stan Lee as he died in 2018. It sucks that he didn't get to have 'Spiderman: Far From Home' as his final cameo. Spiderman has always been his favorite superhero, he help created at Marvel Comics. Regardless, the film did had an amazing soundtrack by composer Michael Giacchino. It was easy to the ears. Overall: I have to say for Spidey's second solo swing through the MCU. It was entertaining for the most part. Even with its flaws; I can still highly recommended checking it out.

","As it tries to present an evolution of Spider-Man, introduce a new hero into the picture and at the same time tell a seemingly ordinary teenage love story, the overall outcome of the movie seems a bit off judging by the quality with which we were accustomed from the Marvel universe. If you see it as an ordinary movie, you'll find it quite ok, like I did, but if see it as a Marvel movie, I think you're in for a little surprise. The biggest problem that I find with it is that it tries to do multiple things which seem to lead into multiple directions but as they tried to present them all as a whole, they missed a bit (or more) on the important stuff. Another aspect which wasn't so good is that it focuses a bit too much on the romance/teenage stuff, which seems even cliché at times, leaving the hero part of Spider-Man in the background, his contribution in the first part of the movie (I might go as far to say that the entire first half) being insignificant or even bad, just to have something to fix or improve upon later.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

","As the first film since Avengers: Endgame, one that's set immediately after that deeply-felt, gigantic Marvel Cinematic Universe chapter and whose protagonist shares a special connection with Iron Man, Spider-Man: Far From Home has some heavy-lifting to do from a narrative standpoint. For one, Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is still processing his grief over the death of his mentor-father figure Tony Stark. And two, in a world that's memorialised Stark's help in saving the universe, Peter is left to wonder how best to honour his legacy. But those aren't ingredients for a fun Spider-Man movie. Far From Home finds fun in Peter's growing fondness for his classmate MJ (Zendaya) and his wish to go on a superhero-free vacation, which in turn powers character motivation and the plot.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

They are only defending their neighborhoods and the stories are low key. Having Spider-man globe trotting just took some of the joy out of it for me.

2. The film leads off from Avengers: Endgame (2019) superbly. Peter Parker/ Spider-Man (Tom Holland) deals constantly with living up to his mentor Tony Stark/ Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) expectations and his legacy.
3. Jake Gyllenhaal (Quentin Beck/ Mysterio) and Tom Holland give great performances.
4. The characters of Mr. Harrington (Martin Starr) and Mr. Dell (J. B. Smoove) serve as really good comedic relief and they are really good comedic duo.
5. The action sequences, for the most part, are entertaining to watch.
6. The entire scene involving Quentin Beck/ Mysterio tricking Peter Parker/ Spider-Man into giving up his friends is visually stunning, mesmerising, and is just terrific cinema rarely found in a Marvel movie.
7. There are a couple really nice, and appropriately handled, call-backs to previous Marvel films. For example, the blasting out of 'Back in Black' by AC/ DC which calls back to Iron Man (2008), and J. K. Simmons reprising his role as J.

","First of all Jake! You always are a pleasure to watch on screen. Now that's out the way Far From Home is a good Spider-Man movie that further builds up Peter. Mysterio uses Peters grief over Tony to manipulate him with his own faking his own family's deaths to get a connection with Peter. Mysterio is a very cool villain in this movie and when he uses his illusion tech on Peter it is all very visually appealing watching glass smash and spider eyes turning into Mysterio heads etc. Less gadgets were used in the movie, yeah he had new suits like the stealth which was basic and I liked it. Then the suit Peter built himself was obviously made with some Stark tech but it was his own and didn't do anything crazy. The gliders look great and the tazer webs were really cool and reminded me a little of the amazing Spider-Man 2 with Electro final battle. I'm not gonna complain too much about that Stark Tech as it is in the MCU and Stark will always be a part of Peter no matter what. This movie showed us how Stark left Peter and what legacy he left behind for him to follow, Stark knew he could be better than him and so he wants to trust Peter to do right by him even if Peter did make a mistake he thought he was doing right. Peter will never be Iron Man and that was clear in the movie and I like that, he made his own suit and has grown into his own powers with the spider sense. We also got to explore more with the relationship Peter has with Happy which was a nice touch and some of the teachers were pretty funny. The final swing was great Peter texting whilst swinging and catching his phone, seeing him in his city looking out for it. Keep putting Peter in his city make him swing around and defend the city cause that's Spider-Man. Then the ending... how amazing to have J. K. Simmons back at it!

I almost started to become annoyed watching him fight thinking of him supposedly filling those shoes. He was useless in almost every fight except the drones, and even then he was struggling. It was frustrating watching him. ESPECIALLY when they gave him the oppurtunity to make a suit and he stayed basic with it. No acidic webs? No combustible webs? You're going with just regular webs, not even blasters? Ok. Now I'm not saying that everything should be easy, but atleast make me believe he can win a fight.

","It seems to me that all Marvel films lately suffer from the same problem, they start to be inflated. The fact is that a mechanism at the box office has been triggered so that if a new chapter does not come out every year, clearly a collection opportunity is lost but expectations are also reduced, there is no longer a taste for waiting, everything is diluted and consumed like a burger. In addition, the characters have lost their autonomy and their character, as they increasingly have to bend to the strategies of a world (Marvel) that is increasingly interconnected, where everyone is a protagonist and for this reason is actually an extras. You can see it well in Avengers (become a terrible minestrone) and also in this last episode of Spider-man where our superhero actually lives in the shadow of Stark. Of the figure of Fury then, which appears everywhere, we would gladly do without, since the times of Ezekiel (25, 17) are long gone and SLJ is now too unpublished to care anyone. I also understand that the product is aimed at young people and therefore, as a matter of identification, Spider-man must be very young, but in a little while he will become the elementary superhero.

The guy is girl crazy and has his priorities completely screwed. No wonder he was swindled by more than a few characters. Really very out of character for Peter Parker.

","'Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019)' is a solid superhero story that's always enjoyable, at its best when continuing the 'high-school' aesthetic of its predecessor. It sometimes tends to get a little lost in spectacle and a few of its elements don't quite make sense. Of course, the spectacle is always impressively rendered and suitably entertaining, though occasionally a little intangible, and the portions of the plot that don't quite add up are easy to look past since the thing is generally so fun. By raising the stakes and trying to make things feel 'big', the flick sets itself apart from its predecessor. Thankfully, it doesn't really miss out on what made 'Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017)' so amazing, though. Character is still at the forefront, which puts this above a considerable amount of other entries in its genre. Pretty much everyone on screen feels like a real person. Their interactions are always entertaining (and often funny) and the main players have mostly satisfying, if sometimes slightly rushed, arcs. It does seem to get slightly confused as to what the central character conflict is, but this doesn't heavily dampen the effect of the overall narrative. The flick also continues the trend of having fantastic villains in (non-Garfield) Spidey stories - even if its baddie doesn't reach the heights of Keaton's 'Vulture' or Molina's 'Doc Ock'. Much has been made of the piece's post-credits sequences. Though they effortlessly set-up a sequel by having consequences that can't be ignored, at least one of them really should have been before the credits because it's the proper ending. Overall, the film is fun, well-constructed, occasionally subversive and tangibly consequential. It's a solid slice of superhero entertainment that has a few flaws but remains a good time throughout. 8/10.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

","I definitely enjoyed it, but I think less than Spider-man : Homecoming. Kind of similar to Guardians 2, it was very funny but sometimes that got too much in the way of hitting an emotional beat or realism. Like we're in an intense battle scene, but sure lets cut to a lady who is still steaming a cape. Or this was running gag of the class trip constantly being ""upgraded"". Like after the first attack, wouldnt they realistically send the kids home? Especially after the events of Infinity War/Endgame? And even when the decision does finally be made to go home, theres still an added ""But we'll tour around London first"". I get that they needed the plot to progress and they couldnt have Peter get on a plane and go back home so early in the movie...but I feel like they could have done something a bit more realistic to keep them there. Like their flights got cancelled or delayed and there effectively stuck. At least for a few days or whatever. It just felt like the danger they were in wasnt being treated seriously. The elevator almost crashing in Homecoming felt more serious and this movie its a way bigger threat. There was another scene in particular that was kind of dumb and honestly could have been cut out as it didnt really add anything. Like this new character takes a photo of Peter in an embarrassing situation and is going to use it against him. But it takes so long for this character to do anything about it. Its not like its the 90s and he needs to get his film developed. Why he didnt show the picture BEFORE getting on the bus, or send a text. Like its the modern age. If he wants this person to know about this picture....then show it. And I get that the filmmakers didnt want Peter's relationships to be effected...but again...why even put the scene there in the first place if the outcome wasnt going to change in any way?

I left the theater. Now let me tell you I LOVE SPIDER-MAN, he was a childhood hero that I could relate to. I am 20 years old and I still could reflect myself on this character, I really do. In the movies with Tobey Maguire, Miles Morales and heck Andrew Garfield I could reflect myself with their versions of Peter Parker. But with Tom I just can't. Everything that Peter does in this movie is really just pathetic. Like wanting to be an Avenger in the first film, now he just wants to go on vacation. Tony Starks death in Endgame doesn't affect Peter anymore... Yeah... How does this affect Peter... he grieved, sure, but he said he wants to go on vacation and date MJ (Michelle Jones){P.S how does Peter like Michelle now. In Homecoming she like Peter, which was obvious... but here it's vice versa. WTF]. That doesn't mix I am sorry. And with Mysterio Holy Shit he gives Mysterio the glasses Tony GAVE TO HIM to save the world, only 10 minutes they talk and he decides to give it to him. And his otive is nothing but embarrassing, casue of Tony Stark again. I could understand Vulture, in Homecoming, but with Mysterio again the same reason...really???) I don't understand Peter Parker in the MCU, he is an idiot. He doesn't know what ""With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility"" (OH Wait I forgot they decide to get rid of Uncle Ben in this universe. For no at all reason...morons) This Peter doesn't grow, he doesn't really change like at all. I don't see him becoming a man, he doesn't grow or change. I knew this movie was going to suck, and I was right, it sucked (IMHO). The only good things in this movie is the action scenes, like that's it, that's all I could say. The MCU ruined the character, and I was sick of it. This isn't Spider-Man, this isn't his actions, this doesn't feel like Spider-Man at all feels like Iron Man Web 2.0.

The narrative itself was all over the place, being inconsistent, overused, and predictable. Watts created a couple unnecessary subplots, that essentially divided the film, instead of bringing it together. Watts tried to keep things light-hearted, but focused a lot on creating a story, based on the outcome of Endgame, so it makes the tones clash a lot more than he would've liked. The screenwriters did the best they could with balancing the humor and the emotion, but like every other Marvel film that tries to be emotional, it gets undercut by forced humor. I didn't mind the story being effected by Endgame all that much, but if they would've made it more of a sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming, while mixing in some Endgame aspects, and what happened to the people around Peter Parker, the narrative would've been tighter, and flowed a lot better. I didn't find the pacing of the film to be completely distracting, due to the great stakes and little amount of downtime, but there are some points that are a little slower than others, mostly due to the amount of filler they added, but the film kept adding fun layers to the story, to keep me invested all the way threw.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

Here Peter just wants to enjoy being a young teen & go on a European school trip with his friends & teachers but everything goes wrong & peter has to deal with being a teen in love with a girl & hanging out with his buds & also being the super hero he needs to be to save everyone.
It's a great performance by Holland & he does come accross a nice guy & a kid way out of his league with his responsibilities.
Peter Parker makes a new Super hero friend in the mysterious new ""Mysterio"" played by the excellent Jake Gyllenhaal, his performance is very good as expected from one of the biggest rising movie stars of our time!!! Mysterio aka: Quentin Beck, is a really nice guy & quickly becomes good friends with peter parker but he has a sinister side. I was actually gutted when Mysterio shows his truth self because Jake gives such an understanding & nice guy performance to his character that you like him right away.
All the big budget fx look great as usual for all the Marvel films & there's plenty of big Action scenes & some very funny bits too.

But he sacrificed his life to undo Thanos' snap. Statistically at least a few of these people would have been ""dusted"" and then restored. I mean, I've had a couple of bad bosses in my time.

For someone with his super strength and other abilities he goes about with zero confidence and exudes awkwardness. The film just feels empty with no soul. The acting is cheesy and the CGI is just so over the top - often with the non-reality sequences I just thought ooh look he's inside a CGI generator. All I can compare it to is a computer game with loads of graphics but one you don't want to play with because the gameplay is rubbish. I didn't care about any of the characters or what happened to them. To me the best Spider-Man was Spider-Man 2 directed by Sam Raimi - awesome casting, story, direction, everything.
This movie also just seemed another excuse for political correctness box ticking.

1344,21 August 2019,scott-sw,7," Spider-Man Returns with More Hits than Misses
","Spiderman Far from Home is the last of the MCU Phase 4, finally bringing the end to the 23 film saga. Fortunately, the closing is far from being a bore, but also far from the perfection.
Our favorite nerdy super-hero, Peter Parker, has returned to his high school in Queens, along with all the others who were snapped out of existence by Thanos during Avengers, Infinity War. Yes, some of his friends did continue and became five years older. Amazingly, we are left to believe that all of his friends such as Mary Jane, Ned, and Flash were all part of the glitch. And the world is mourning the loss of Iron Man. Someone needs to take his place.
The clique is on its way to Europe. Peter (Tom Holland) is looking forward to getting a little time-off and getting to know Mary Jane (Zendaya) more. So deadest on this quest, he ditches some calls from Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson), infuriating the SHIELD agent. Peter also has doubts about Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) dating his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei).
However, Peter finds out trouble will follow him wherever he goes. While in Europe, some creatures called the Elementals stage attacks against some European cities where Peter's friends are. Fury brings Peter in to meet Quentin Beck/Mysterio, (Jake Gyllenhall). He is an agent from another Earth dimension, tracking the elementals, and needing to eliminate them. He asks Spidey for some help - and he gets it.
Still, it is not quite enough to do the trick. While they seemingly defeat the alien entities, Peter realizes that something does not add up. It is mostly with Quentin, who is not who he appears to be. Now it is up to Spidey to defeat the charlatan, Mysterio.
I must get my flaws out first - because Far from Home has them. The first one is the padding. The movie is probably thirty minutes too long - mostly dedicating needless scenes to peril and laughs that do not move the plot. The guiltiest scene was that of Peter trying to figure out Tony Stark's glasses, which are an engineering miracle. Peter accidentally launches a strike against Flash Thompson (Tony Revolori), so he has to stop it. Another has him put in an embarrassing situation with another SHIELD agent that Flash Thompson witnesses.
The other flaw in this one relates to the source material. Although a fan of Spiderman comics, I am not a purist. It is plain to see that if Peter Parker was in modern-day Queens, the characters of Ned Leeds, Flash Thompson, and Mary Jane could very well be minorities. However, the characters of Aunt May and Mary Jane Watson are betrayed. Mary Jane had a super-outgoing personality coupled with strength and confidence - but Zendeya plays it with emo, attitude, and smarminess. Marisa Tomei plays Aunt May as an outgoing, sexy older woman who is more selfish for her own interest. The original Aunt May was selfless, strong, quiet, and reserved. And it seems EVERYONE realizes Peter is Spidey faster than Lois Lane realized who Clark Kent really was!
Also, it seems like Peter Parker took a step back from what he wanted in Homecoming. In that movie, he wanted to be treated like an adult by Happy and Tony. He desired hero status, and wanted to do bigger things. In this film, he wants to be more like a kid and not have those responsibilities. Finally, since when can someone dupe Nick Fury as Quentin did?
However, there is a lot to like about this movie. First is Tom Holland who plays the character with such Ernst. He makes Peter complicated, conflicted, and confused. He has to finally take initiative in order to protect the people he loves. This was much appreciated as Andrew Garfield played the part with too much emo, depression, and reactionary.
Another strength, of course, are the special effects. As with most MCU movies, they do not take precedence over story, but rather add flavor to it. Furthermore, one particular scene laced with confusion and bizarre imagery matches what the Mysterio character was all about in the comics. It is truly mesmerizing.
Far from Home does have a lot of misses, but the hits are rock solid. Probably the biggest shot-in the arm comes in a post-scene cameo that should have an audience clapping and laughing at the same time as an old Spiderman staple returns.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

","First off, this movie follows on from the original film and it remains heavily a high school comedy. I got a mixed feeling about how large chunks of this film are spent on the side characters that are solely for comedic purposes. Their relationship isn't necessarily crucial to the plot. The high school aspect of the film is too strong for my liking. But I enjoyed Peter trying to execute his plan to tell MJ his feelings. In addition, this film try to address some of the issues that we all had after 'Endgame', in terms of, did all of Peter's class disappear at the snap? & how exactly did they return? In terms of the supe stuff, I think this film is a massive improvement from what we saw in Homecoming. The action sequences are incredible, they are far more cooler, trippier, and entertaining than in the first movie. The visual effects are stunning. The main villain is also very good as he has an interesting motive. However, there's still a slight sense of underwhelming. I just didn't feel that this character is as good as Vulture from 'Homecoming'. The mid-credit scene is excellent. It's a serious scene which makes me really pumped me up for where they might go with the third Spider-Man film. Then there's the post-credit scene, which is kinda confusing.

I felt really cheated cause now we have to wait another two years for the next movie. The film could have ended with a hint for another sequel or movie but instead we got that ending scene. So now we the fans have to wait just to know what happens to the famous web slinger. It's a cheap move by marvel to make fans wait but marvel has used this trick so many times in their movies that now it became a real problem. If marvel doesn't stop doing those end credit scenes that give the fans nothing but waiting. The MCU is going to lose its element of surprise. Even the second end credits scene doesn't give much. Mysterio's character kind of disappointed me. All fans know he is an enemy of spiderman so when I see him on screen I know he's up to something and he's not a good guy. That's why when it's revealed he is an antagonist so it didn't surprised me cause I was expecting it.

","In a nutshell, I didn't like it.
Like the first film the bad guy holds it together. Jake Gylenhall is charismatic, funny and holds your attention when he's on screen. It's nothing against Tom Holland or the cast, I certainly couldn't do it. But to date the villains are the main attraction. I love the big screen version of Mysterio, honestly I wasn't too bothered about what was happening when he wasn't around.
Spider-Man, at least this version works great as part of an ensemble. He's a great addition to Captain america Civil War & Avengers but his single movies don't impress me at all.
I know it's the younger years maybe when he's older wiser and more Spidey like I'll enjoy it more. To me it felt like watching a children's film with a few superheroes thrown in to meet the current trend. So far the Spider-Man films have been a dramatic change of tone compared to other Marvel comic films, but they really need to make it more appealing to audiences over the age of 12.
It's cheesy, childish, predicable and pays lip service to previous films.

","It is supposed to Endgame was the end of a phase in Marvel so that Far from home opened another with many changes, but it remains the same, the same formula that obviously will never change, jokes without grace, absurd stories. If this is supposed to be an evolution for the MCU, where are the changes? Perhaps they plan to continue following the same formula for another 10 years and make another film that supposedly closes a cycle. That was Endgame, an end to something but an end of what? The ridiculous excuse of being the closing to a saga of 20 movies but is there really a difference now? You yourself may notice that no.

1418,6 July 2019,Magow-Intermean,7," Spider-Man: Far From Home Review
","In the wake of Thanos' defeat, Peter Parker (Tom Holland) leaves Spidey at home for a class trip to Europe, where he can ask out MJ (Zendaya). But he's soon approached by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) to save the day with new hero Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal).
Avengers: Endgame irrevocably changed the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The apocalyptic time-travel epic not only wrapped up a decade of narrative threads and character arcs, but set up a whole new world in which half of the population has blinked back into existence, five tumultuous years after being blinked out of it. How will the MCU address such universe-altering consequences?
The answer, as Spider-Man: Far From Home proves, is with the same considerable wit, boundless energy and tonal levity that made 2017's Spider-Man: Homecoming such a joy. In its opening minutes, Far From Home establishes its post-Endgame world with a hilariously flippant extended gag sequence that doubles as a handy catch-up reel for those who skipped the second- biggest box office hit of all time. (Spoilers follow, if you too are in that camp.)
The good news is that Thanos is dead and dusted. The bad news is that Tony Stark is dead too. And while the world is clamouring for Spider-Man to take up Iron Man's mantle as lead Avenger, poor Peter Parker (Holland) really needs a break. Just as Iron Man 3 saw Stark haunted by his trip through the Chitauri wormhole in Avengers Assemble, Endgame's endgame casts a shadow over Parker, now grieving his mentor's untimely death and hoping to relinquish his super-suit for a little while - less a Spider-Man 2 Spider-Man-No-More than a Spider-Man-not-right-now.
An upcoming school trip across Europe is just the opportunity Parker needs to both put his heroism on hold and declare his feelings for the brilliant, beautiful, and slightly terrifying MJ (Zendaya) - hatching a romantic plan for the holiday involving the Eiffel Tower and her favourite flower, the black dahlia (""Like the murder""). Ned (Jacob Batalon), meanwhile, reckons he and his best bud will be ""American bachelors in Europe"", bully Flash Thompson (Tony Revolori) has become a swaggering vlogger who broadcasts to his #flashmob, and teacher Mr Harrington (a consistently hilarious Martin Starr) is still one lost student away from a total breakdown.
"" Faces Endgame's monolithic legacy head-on, before leaving it behind to embark on its own globetrotting adventure.
Just as Homecoming was a whip-smart John Hughes-inspired teen comedy that also happened to be a Spider-Man movie, Far From Home would fly by without any interrupting superheroics. The impeccable Spidey-sense of humour from the previous film isn't quite as well-honed here (a recurring gag about J.B. Smoove's teacher believing in witchcraft never lands, while Ned and Peter's golden double-act gets less screen time), but returning director Jon Watts clearly relishes the coming-of-age touchstones afforded by his teen hero, this time combining the Hughes influence with a Eurotrip-inspired vision of Europe (a brief jaunt to the Netherlands is improbably populated with windmills, tulips galore, and kindly sports hooligans).
But superheroics do, inevitably, interrupt when Nick Fury (Jackson) hijacks the school trip, recruiting Spidey to battle destructive elemental creatures alongside Jake Gyllenhaal's newly arrived hero Quentin Beck, aka Mysterio - purporting to hail from the same alternate dimension as the monsters. Watts nailed the localised Queens setting of Homecoming, but clearly delights in the possibilities of taking the friendly Spider-Man out of his neighbourhood - Parker now contending with crumbling architecture, crowds of sightseers, and enemies unaffected by his webs. The director gets maximum mileage out of Spider-Man's status as the most acrobatic Avenger, punctuating the action set-pieces with dizzying flips and thwips, most effectively in a slick showdown on London's Tower Bridge.
After Homecoming saw Parker working under the tutelage of Tony Stark, the Iron Man-shaped void brings three new potential father-figures into his life. Mysterio, in a typically non-traditional MCU twist on the source material, is now his co-worker and confidante, offering companionship and empathy for Parker's latest loss. And then there's Fury, Jackson back on mischievously imperious form, both lamenting that Earth's most available hero is a literal schoolkid and relishing the chance to brandish his considerable authority over him. And after spending much of Homecoming fielding Parker's needy voicemails, Jon Favreau's Happy Hogan now bonds with the youngster through their shared grief and fear of Fury - all while striking up a secret relationship with Aunt May (Tomei). It's testament to Watts that these character threads dovetail neatly without jostling for screentime, bringing even more emotional depth to the MCU's Spidey-verse.
If the buddy relationship between Parker and Beck initially feels bland, Gyllenhaal later shakes up his vanilla heroism, the film switching up a gear just as it appears to be going through the motions. There's no equivalent rug-pull to the Vulture reveal in Homecoming - anyone who took Spidey Comics 101 will see a major development coming - but Watts stages his upping-of-the-stakes moment with a jolt of energy that spurs a wickedly fun second half, boasting surprising ties to the minutiae of the MCU that reach right back to the franchise beginnings. Not only that, but Far From Home unexpectedly delivers the series' most thrillingly mind-bending imagery since Doctor Strange had his third eye opened by The Ancient One.
Despite everything else going on, Far From Home charmingly never loses sight of Peter's quest to ask out MJ. The couple's would-be-romance is sweet and endearing, but not sickly in the slightest - and Zendaya shines, dropping razor-wire zingers with deadpan delight. Tom Holland remains a note-perfect Spider-Man - still funnier and more believably teenage than Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield's incarnations. While Far From Home finds him desperate to take the weight of the world off his shoulders, Holland never loses the ebullient spark that makes him one of the MCU's most endearing figures.
Far From Home is a looser film than Homecoming, with pacing that occasionally slackens, and a compulsion to give every minor character time to shine. But it's a light-footed summer blockbuster that faces Endgame's monolithic legacy head-on, before leaving it behind to embark on its own globetrotting adventure. The MCU doesn't need a new Iron Man yet - Far From Home proves it's more than safe in the web-slinging hands of Spider-Man.
It's not quite the home-run of Homecoming, but Far From Home isn't far from matching it, with heaps of humour, energetic action, and the answers Endgame left you craving.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

Starting right after the events of Endgame, Far From Home explains exactly what happens when things went back to normal and focusing on Peter Parker getting back into his high school life again. Similar to Homecoming, Far From Home focuses a great deal on character development and scenes with Peter Parker and his friends more than the actual Superhero action stuff. I liked how the movie deals with the absence of a specific character and everyone trying to move on and get on with their lives.

New York City is an essential part of the web-slinger's identity, whether he's doing friendly neighborhood stuff or zipping through Manhattan with a slice of pizza, and separating him from all that for a quick European vacation makes the character feel rather vanilla.

","It's a great story. The character growth is dynamic and well paced. It happens on all facets and it's very clear that the writers and Jon Watts have taken to heart criticism of the first two MCU Spider-Man films. There's the heart-wrenching loss of Aunt May (never gets easier to see any Spider-Man losing someone), a serious stepping up of Tom Holland's Peter Parker to be more than just an Iron Man Jr., and an apologetic reminder that Parker is broke (and not a Stark trust fund kid), both during the movie and once again at the end, when his slate is wiped clean. Garfield gets a chance to save Holland's MJ in a very dramatic mini-""redemption arc"". The best part of the script is the motif that Spider-Man's best attribute is his incredible moral compass, and great moral strength, willing to take on all the pain and sacrifice so that his friends and neighborhood can live on prosperously even if he gets left behind. It's an echo that establishes the Spider-Man at the end of the film as a spiritual successor to Capt.

Both actors combined to make some of the greatest scenes in a Spider-Man film to date. I'm ready for Tom Holland to be the next lead of the MCU. My only complaint was that I knew the plot twist when I was old enough to read comics. The entire first hour expected the audience to buy into the lie that Mysterio was a good guy when in fact the villain was introduced 55 years ago in TASM #13. The first act felt like a waste of my time, and I found myself not really caring for the characters. What this movie failed to do was realize that we don't need a plot twist; Peter Parker does. The original Spider-Man with Tobey Maguire did a great job with the Green Goblin in this case. Of course we knew he was a villain, but that doesn't mean Peter doesn't have to! With this being said, I throughly enjoyed the last half of the movie once they stopped beating around the bush.

He helps out his sister Ludy(Nina Lorenzo) run a modest grocery store, which is really, to be honest, little more than a hole in the wall. It's not made clear if his sister pays him. He could be working for room and board. But still, that's better than the unemployed young men who sit on a bench outside their small business, layabouts smoking and drinking their days and nights away in a perpetual torpor, resigned, seemingly, to life passing them by without putting up any resistance. Nandang knows there is no future in Tondo. He has a plan, but it takes money to put that plan into motion, or else it's just dreams unfulfilled. Ludy's pretty friend stops by every day to shop for her mother. That's who Nandang wants to share his dreams with, or rather, his plan to get them out of Tondo. ""Insiang"", directed by Lino Brocka, played at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival, a first for the Philippines, which introduced the slums of Manila under President Ferdinand Marcos to an international audience. It was a cry for help. Nobody helped. Insiang(Hilda Koronel) also happens to be the girl's name. The conditions being what it is, deplorable and inhumane, forces Insiang to act in a transgressive manner as a method for survival. A scandal rocks their small world of barely-getting-by; the titular character has trouble at home, a bizarre love triangle, but Nandang doesn't care. Walking Insiang home, he confesses, against the backdrop of shanties upon shanties on an unpaved muddy road; he fools himself, believing that his goal to live ""far away from here; far away from all this trouble"" is plausible. Insiang lets her friend dream. It's not a plan. The young woman knows his lot in life, the day in, day out drudgery of being knee-deep in poverty and and the impossibility of escape, because she lives with the same hardship, too. Insiang saves the honesty for her mother. She deserves it. This is the real world.

","Now, for years I've said that I loved Spider-Man Homecoming. I've said it's one of the few Marvel movies that I actually enjoyed all the way through. While that much is still true, upon a second viewing I don't think I love it anymore. I like it, it's solid and it's still one of the best Marvel movies, but it wasn't as good on a repeat viewing. With the original fresh in my mind going into the sequel, I was a little nervous that I wouldn't think that it was as good as I remembered the first one being either. However, I think Far From Home might be better than Homecoming. That's still my first impression, it may change with time, but as it is right now this is right up there with Homecoming as one of my favourite Marvel movies. Far From Home acts as both a sequel to Homecoming and an epilogue to Avengers Endgame. What is the world like after *spoiler*? What is the world like without *spoiler*? How has *spoiler's* *spoiler* affected the world and Peter Parker? This film explores that. The comedy is hilarious, the characters are all loveable with great performances, the story is engaging and this movie probably has the most creative and thrilling action and effects out of any of the Marvel movies since Doctor Strange. The story of this movie has a lot of twists and turns and I don't want to give anything away, but if you've seen the trailers or even read the title, you know it's about Peter Parker going on a school trip to Europe. It's so great to finally see Spider-Man get out of New York in his own standalone movie and see all the cool stuff he can do in other cities. It was great. The big twist near the end was pretty predictable if you know anything about the comics, but the post-credits scenes are amazing and make me beyond excited to see what becomes of them in future movies! Overall, this is a must-see for any Marvel fans, but even if you aren't one this is a solid action-comedy with a lot of humour and a lot of heart for the whole family.

It was an enjoyable watch and it follows the same high quality that all Marvel/Disney films are accustomed to, however, both as a stand-alone film and the last installment of Phase Three, I am a bit upset that I didn't enjoy it more. The first act of the movie was slow. Nothing about the story was surprising; in fact, the most surprising part of the film were the two after credits scenes. There is a certain sequence in the film which involves AR tech and while I must admit it was incredible from a technical VFX standpoint, I thought it was extremely out of place in the film aesthetically.

First, the revelation: Mysterio is evil. It could've never been predicted with the information provided by the film, and it was too complicated and needed to explain a lot of stuff for it to make sense, which felt forced instead of shocking. Second, the climax, where Spidey fights Mysterio. We're shown at the beginning very briefly that Peter's 'tingle' has been failing. In the final battle, he relies 100% on it to defeat the villain. From the 'doesn't work' point to the 'I rely on it 100%', there's no arc, no change, no justification as to why it didn't work before and it does now. Therefore, it again feels forced and kind of a Deus Ex Machina.

","Charming and fully Spider-Man through and through. The only complaint is that with all the mystery surrounding the Mysterio twists and that title, the mind races to second guess what sort of pretzel-like twists the plot will go through. However, it's rather straight-forward, modern, and a little Iron Man Three-ish in tone, which, once it settled, I liked very much, in-fact the villainous twists were rather in continuity with the earthy villainy of Homecoming.
It's exquisitely modern-feeling and naturally inclusive, and yet manages to have a classic 'movie Spider-Man' feel, compounded by the gonzo, squeal-out-loud, world-breaking cameo at the end. The roadmovie/field trip feel is really well implemented (A natural London was a joy to see), the comedy is on point throughout (It was extremely funny at points, see: Martin Starr), and the mixture of themes are all handled and managed satisfactorily throughout (although they all get murky at the end).
Not quite sure what to make of the actual post-credits sequence but I'm sure a Reddit pass will subdue that.
Overall it's a perfect distillation of the Marvel machine: It has the comedy of Rangarok, the punk irreverence of Iron Man, the visual wit of Doctor Strange, the slackness of Ant-Man and the Wasp, and the groove of Guardians.

The emphasis is clearly on having fun, providing a crowd-pleasing adventure. This movie manages to develop a more intimate story, mixing up action and danger with more comedic and even romantic moments.

I'm seriously starting to think that IMDB should do something about their rating algorithm to make it meet the new requirements/vulnerabilities because it's now starting to missing to represent a good picture of what people ""really"" thinks about the movies. Especially the rating system should be devided into age ranges that can represent the thaughts of different age groups besides the general rating of the movie. I can honestly say that the rating algorithm got so rusty and vulnerable that it's no longer has the capability of being a good measure of common view. I've kept watching movies rated say 7.5 presently but it wouldn't have gotten even 6.0 if it was ten years ago.

The fact that Uncle Ben hasn't even been mentioned is really upsetting and kind of feels like a slap to the face for us Spider-Man fans. Instead, we've got Iron Man as Spider-Man's father figure and Iron Man just gives him gadgets rather than teaching him important lessons and how to take responsibility.

","To any true fan of the webslinger, this is not the Spider-Man you are looking for.

Where is the little guy, fighting alone and using his brains as well as brawn to overcome incredible odds while having to deal with a sick Aunt May? Where is the burden of responsibility that failing to stop a burglar ending up creating? Whereas the MCU has given us some great moments (Iron Man, GOTG, Endgame etc), Sony's Homecoming and this latest effort have been rife with awful casting and ridiculous dialogue. The CGI, however, was impressive (as it should be), and the 'illusion' scenes with Mysterio (a very competent Jake G) were well staged, but this was by far the worst Spider-Man outing so far (and the worst of the MCU).

1556,3 July 2019,T-ZER0,7," Great Movie, But not as good as Homecoming
","The sequel to the popular Spider-Man Homecoming takes place after Avengers Endgame, when Spider-Man is pressured with the task of being the next Tony Stark. Visual effects wise, this movie is better than the first. Storyline wise? It's a good story but the first was still better. I like the costumes for Mysterio and Spider-Man on this film. They did an amazing job on them. Speaking of which, Mysterio is done really well on this. Like most fans, I knew he was a crook all along. The funny thing was when I saw this in theaters, I found it amusing that most people in the audience fell for his tricks. They clearly never heard of Mysterio at all.
My big problem with the film is the love story. I know people will get angry at me for saying this, but Peter should have never been with Michelle. If you had the Spider-Man Homecoming app (Before it was the Spider-Man Far From Home app) you'll see that before Peter was into her, she was the weird girl who kept texting him every minute because Ned gave her his number. She would always call him names and just pester him. I don't know why Peter would fall for a girl who just bugs him every second on his phone, but it's a movie right? Most teens I am friends with ignore girls like that because they are annoying. But hey, I guess Zendaya's popular so we have to love her right??
The way Mysterio's gang is put together is as good as Vulture's gang, they are people who have a beef with Tony Stark. It makes sense, and it gives the characters purpose and a good story.

","I was very dissappointed in this Spiderman movie and the last one. I realize the majority of reviewers seem to think it is a great movie. Please explain why? Do not just say it was great. Give me details.
The reasons I did not like this movie follows. In this incarnation Spiderman is portrayed as an awkward teenager that lacks confidence. Who wants a hero that lacks confidence and is awkward?Not me. I want a superhero that portrays himself as confident and able to believ he can handle any emergency or supervillian he may have to face. Save your awkward teenage heroes for the Disney channel.. There was not much action displaying Spiderman fighting his superhero skills. There was a scene where he fought the giant made of water. . His webbing doesn't work against it. All he does is try to use a portion of a buliding to block some of the flooding caused by the giant. The only time he looks like a hero is the last 10 minutes of the movie when he uses his spider sense to defeat Mysterio. Hardly enough action for a 2 hour movie.. Maybe the younger crowd, teenager and early twenties, like this version of Spiderman. Maybe they can relate to him better as the average man. I don't want my superhero portrayed as the average man. I want him portrayed as a confident powerful hero. I will not spend time or money to see another Spiderman movie unless theyreboot the format.

","Spider-Man Far From Home is a pretty average superhero film, which is good. Most hero films nowadays tend to leave out important aspects of a good film for realistic CGI fight scenes and funny jokes. Spider-Man Far From Home balances it all out, while still giving us good CGI, which is definitely respectable in my opinion. This movie is not without flaws and definitely had moments that felt unnecessary, but the good outweighs the bad in this case. The villain didn't feel completely developed either and the motives for his actions were very plain and simple. It some ways, that's fine, but it doesn't engage the audience into their emotions like Sandman did in Spider-Man 3.

Face-palm as grown men berate a teenager for failing at tasks they also assign to people with advanced combat/tactics training, people with magical powers, or even gods/demigods...again. Be confused as to why a man that supposedly swore off WMD's gave loads of them to a sixteen year old. Be baffled as to why the director/writer keeps forgetting that these kids are supposed to be SIXTEEN years old. And has a grown woman order a SIXTEEN year old boy to take his clothes off, and another boy take pictures of him in his underwear...and its played for laughs. That's not funny that's ephebophilia! It's also a crime in most states nowadays. Had it been a grown man ordering a sixteen year old girl to take her clothes off, and someone snapping pictures...I doubt quite so many people would laugh. Try to grasp why Tony Stark would have turned down hologram technology if he was such a brazziliant smarty pants. My god man! He invented holodecks! Using it for video game adaptations alone would have made you richer than the dreams of avarice. Struggle to care that Peter is pining after another girl. Yes...another. He wasn't after Mary Ja...I mean Michelle in the first one. But this one is absolutely positively without a doubt his one true underage love interest...oh teenagers For he is a mere boy of sixteen, one who is already battling crows feet. Cringe every time you hear the term ""Peter Tingle"". Struggle as you try to understand the villain's master plan, as it can easily be undone by someone accidentally strolling through the hologram. As the illusions have no physical field to keep people from walking right into them....as Spider-Man swings into one with no issue whatsoever. Stifle your boredom as they try to make a 'what a twist' moment when revealing that a character named for an old school villain is revealed...to be a villain! Grieve as you watch Marisa Tomei's interesting and refreshing take on Aunt May get swallowed into the swamps of ""These egotistical crybabies want even more screen time! They're spending more time out of their masks than in them. But now they want to annex the minute and a half you get now as well"". All in all for me the movie falls somewhere into ""Ant-Man"" territory. Not bad, not great. If you turn off your brain its enjoyable kind of romp.

I would rather have created this Spider-man a little more darker. Probably, he should no longer attended high school or at least continued through home-schooling, struggled with some dark times. I would rather created him more mature. Secondly, it seems to me that script-writers of comic-movies write their scripts based on latest genius codes written by software engineers - not based on a what they have in mind. What Maestro does and the imaginary monster he created is ridiculous. What happened to those superhero movies like Iron-man, The Avengers (2012). In those movies, what superheros and villains possess as so called super-power somehow make sense and not ridiculous. They are great movies and make you watch them again and again. Also, they almost destroyed every character they built in previous movies, Spider-man himself or Nick Fury only because the film-maker trying too hard to be cool.

1653,17 April 2020,eminkl,7," A decidedly middle-of-the-pack effort, which is somewhat disappointing
","As Marvel's first follow-up to the massive culmination that was Endgame, this is lighter by necessity. Spidey's a character that really benefits from a smaller stage anyway, so the timing is appropriate, but he's quickly pulled out of his comfort zone and never totally settles in. I think the foreign location has a lot to do with that. New York City is an essential part of the web-slinger's identity, whether he's doing friendly neighborhood stuff or zipping through Manhattan with a slice of pizza, and separating him from all that for a quick European vacation makes the character feel rather vanilla. His classmates are along for the ride, of course, which maintains his connection to high school drama and the wise-cracking teen culture, and that helps, but it's an issue. Tom Holland is still a nice fit for the role, achieving a difficult combination of confidence, spontaneity and awkward social cues. Jake Gyllenhaal is convincing and charismatic as the perception-altering Mysterio, lending depth and direction to a character that's often rather flat in the books. Samuel Jackson's Nick Fury is around a lot too, personally dealing with several situations that would have probably been beneath him in earlier circumstances, and there's one great casting surprise late in the film that left my entire theater gasping for air. The effects also look phenomenal, with a particular credit due for making one of the comic's most ridiculous-looking foils, somehow, seem pretty cool. Most of the pieces are still there, and it's loyal to many things I enjoyed about Homecoming, it's just... lesser in most every way?

","After the events of Endgame Peter returns home still mourning the death of Tony. The school years over and Peter and his classmate decide to go on a European Vacation. Peter tries to uses this opportunity to tell MJ how he really feels about her. Only change of plans when Nick fury contacts Peter and introduces him to Quentin Beck aka Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) says he's from another universe and that these elemental beings that destroyed his world are coming to do the same ro this world. Now Peter has to deal with these elementals, while deciding what to do about his position as Spider-Man and the responsibility Tony left him. Far from home is a movie that feels as if it's trying to expand on the concept as Peter as a character. Where in homecoming he was still taken more of small steps with not really that big of a threat. Here he's left with a more complicated position. As not only does he try to balance is life with trying to tell MJ how he feels , but he's also having to work with Nick Fury dealing with this whole elemental situation. Peter constantly moving in this film with something going on the whole time. The films does have vacation tone of film it far more heavy on the humor and in many way a lot of the jokes are spot on. The only problem is that constantly throughout this movie they, Knock at the fact of everybody calls him the next Ironman the next Ironman. It falls their in the point that he doesn't really have that individuality as Spider-Man. This film really does in some way hammers in the fact that Tony's dead to the point it can come off rather annoying, The rest of the cast does okay I don't really care for flash in this universe he's more just a Douche then a bully and a jerk. I found much of the banter between Ned and Betty funny. M. J while it has been stated that this is not Mary Jane Watson this whole Emo/Goth personality is not for me. Though I did find a relationship between her and Peter that can go somewhere. Overall the movies more character driven and while it does have action thrown in. It's more or less a romance or romance story between Peter and Mj but the same time focusing more on the characters rather than just surrounded it with the usual wild distractive action.*Spoilers* Mysterio While I found his portrayal to very enjoyable for the most part a lot of the film does hinder on him and Peter. The not so shocking fact is that Mysterio is actually a bad guy. Fact of the matter is the whole plot of the movie comic wise or not knowing that. It's not really the problem to be have with him. The problem derives from that unlike Michael Keaton's vulture his motivation is not as compelling, that really all he wants to do is get the last laugh over Tony. A better motivation would have been welcomed this is like the 6th villain to have it out for Tony. In a Spider-Man movie the villain should have more a connection to Spider-Man. Now when he does finally put his plans in action it is enjoyable the visuals alone are very reminiscent of the character. The illusions and the visuals are beyond creative what they were able to do with the character. Also the costumes look really good, same with peter. I can't help but also point out how wasted the elementals were you could of had Mysterio as a god guy but you could of had three villains in this movie. The earth elemental could been Sandman, The water elemental Hydroman which they actually reference the character.. The driver Dimitri that escort Peter and the others around that's the chameleon.

","Far From Home is a movie that can certainly be silly if you dig deep into it, but has enough creativity to be mentally satisfying and has an irresistible propulsive energy. Holland is great again in the lead, and while his scripted lines left plenty to be desired, I loved to see Gyllenhaal as Mysterio. It's bizarre that a scientist close to Stark could then claim to be from another dimension and nobody bats an eye (though the post credits scene explains at least why Fury didn't realize), and his lines given to his helpers feel far too egomaniacal.
The jokes aren't forced and are funny, and the coming of age and romance subplots didn't take too much space but did enough to generate investment. I love the choice to go all in on the visual creativity; the first illusions scene is an absolute joy to watch. The action scenes and timing of events are a bit unrealistic as always, but the premise of using drones to create these illusions was great. It's not hard to find flaws or plot holes, but few of them jump out when you're watching because between rooting for Peter with MJ, rooting for him as Spider-Man in the action scenes, and enjoying the small character interactions, you get caught up in all the fun that it has to offer.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

1727,5 July 2019,theredsky,4," Spider-Man: Far From Home Review
","Spider-Man: Far From Home is a good movie and a good follow up to the events of Endgame. Here are the negatives. The first 30-45 minutes kinda suck. It's paced awkwardly and incredibly rushed. Scenes just kind of start and stop with no rhyme or reason. It gets a whole lot better after that point though. Peter Parker still MOSTLY has the same internal struggle of Spider-Man: Homecoming. Peter is trying to figure out if he should be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man or be more than that and I wished they had not kept that internal struggle from the first film. Half of the jokes in this movie weren't that funny to me. The visual effects in some areas were a little shotty but most were really good. My final issue is that there is a literal plot device item that comes into play about halfway through the movie and it doesn't make a lot of sense at all for me. Here are the positives. The acting is really good. Tom Holland, Jake Gyllenhaal, Samuel L. Jackson, and Jacob Batalon are standouts from the film. Jake Gyllenhaal and Tom Holland have outstanding chemistry together and it's a joy to watch them on screen together. I really hope those two work together again in the future. The rest of the actors do a good job. Most of the visual effects are really good for a Marvel movie. There is a sequence in the film that I think is absolutely amazing that I can't talk about due to spoilers. The Elementals look lifelike and both Spider-Man and Mysterio's visual effects look really good. I absolutely love Mysterio's actual costume. It just looks amazing. The action in this film is really good. You understand what is going on and who is who in each action sequence. I like the story for this film. It has this kind of spy thriller vibe while mixed with a romance comedy that I think works really well together and I like how each destination the group goes to is essential to the plot. I do enjoy the score a lot even though I prefer Homecoming's score. The cinematography is fine. It's not extraordinary but it's decent. The tone mostly remains consistent except for a couple scenes and after the first 30-45 minutes, the film is paced really well. Overall, Spider-Man: Far From Home is a good follow up to Endgame with great acting, action, and good visual effects even if the first part of the film sucks.

The concept of Mysterio and the monsters simply being an illusion to trick people into thinking that a new iron man was born, was a fascinating and original idea. Some of the parts in which they were remembering or talking about Tony Stark and his departure were quite good. The parts with Happy and Peter's aunt were great and set a little bit of a humorous tone every now and then for which the Marvel movies are known.

Jake Gyllenhal made for a formidable and utterly dastardly villain for the charming Holland. My complaint in this movie was Zendaya. No, it's not because of her race. I couldn't care less about that because I honestly think it's neat that they're trying to do something new with the characters (Ned is also a great example). My complaint with Zendaya's MJ is that she isn't MJ. They wrote her simply just to be an angsty, brooding, ""I'm so weird and quirky about my weirdness but also sarcastic but also cute and independent"" type girl that it just came across as really pretentious and honestly stupid. MJ is the popular and preppy girl who's pretty normal but also sassy and independent.

For instance, Mysterio (Quentin Beck) while justifying his position was accusing 'TONY STARK' as a FRAUD !!!! Is this a joke ???

The film had a few good ideas but it felt as if they couldn't pick one so the shoved them all in without explaining them all that well. Once again SONY has put their input to a Spiderman film and it has turned back into just another Spiderman film with another actor fulling Spider-Man's suit (No offence to Tom Holland).

On the one hand, it must be admitted that the film does not have a problem in the moments of showing this plot; Both when we see Peter alone and busy looking at a large picture of Iron Man or facing documentaries about Tony Stark, and when those around him pressure him about this and unintentionally annoy him, the nature of Peter's feelings is transferred to the target audience.

In such a way that things are introduced to the audience many times, they have no role in the story and characterization of the characters for forty minutes, and then again when there was no need to mention them, they are in front of the audience's eyes.

","This movie was better than i expected! It didn't shatter my expectations or anything, after all i was a fan of Homecoming. But it was much better than i expected!
First of all acting is great. Nothing oscar worthy but preety good nonetheless. Especially Tom Holland and Jake Gyllenhaal both did a great job.
Directing and scenaries were great and i love the idea of Spidey visiting various European countries for a change! Also the hallucinations scene is one of the best in the MCU, period.
As far as plot is concerned its preety good for a superheroe movie! Granted the twist is extremely obvious but the ending sure was unexpected and i certainly did not expect the after credit scene! However, i get that Peter is naive and all but his decision to give Mysterio the glasses was beyond stupid. But other than that it's a preety fun story.
The action is also a huge step up from Homecoming. I liked Homecoming, but the action was preety supbar. Here that's definitely not the case. Spider-Man is much more fun to watch fight, much more experienced, the set pieces are better and more diverse and the final battle is preety nice. Glad it's not another *good guy vs bad guy who both have the exact same powers*.
As far as humour is concerned i think they did a great job! It's not amazing but most jokes land preety well.
Character wise, i really don't mind Michelle and i think her interaction with Peter are preety cute. Spider-Man is great (apart from when he's a bit too stupid) and I'm glad we got to see him more experienced and less tech dependent . Side characters such as Ned and Nick Furry are fun and thankfully not overused, and Mysterio is a great villain! His motivations admittedly are lacking a bit (not bad or too unrealistic/dumb just not strong enough to drive him to do such things), but still they got his manipulative character and the way he goes about his schemes down almost perfectly!

","After the events of Avengers: Endgame, Tom Holland's Peter Parker/Spider-Man returns after being blipped for five years by Thanos's snap and is still dealing with the loss of his mentor Tony Stark as well as trying be the best Spider-Man he can be. When Peter decides to take a European vacation that's a class trip and ask his crush MJ out, he thinks it will be relaxing time away from being a superhero. When four elemental creatures disturb his vacation and a new mysterious hero shows up known as Quintin Beck/Mysterio, Spider-Man must team up with Mysterio, Nick Fury, and Maria Hill to stop the entities before it's too late. So first off, Tom Holland's Peter Parker/Spider-Man is fantastic as always bringing us a emotionally distressed side of his character we haven't seen until now. Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury is great as Peter's new mentor in this film, although I don't think he was used as much as he was intended to be, but was still great. Jake Gyllenhaal as Quintin Beck/Mysterio is perfect casting at its finest while also bringing us one of the greatest Spider-Man characters we have ever seen to life on screen. Zendaya as MJ was great as well and I was glad she had more screentime this time around. Jacob Batalon as Ned was funny in every scene he was in. Cobie Smulders's Maria Hill was also a great addition to the film. Maria Tomei's Aunt May and Jon Favreau's Happy Hogan had great chemistry together. Overall, Spider-Man: Far From Home definitely lives up to the hype as one of the best Spider-Man films, while also giving us a scent of what's to come in Spider-Man's future and Phase 4 of the MCU.

The jokes were often on point and It made me laugh more often then most Marvel films. There is one big problem with this film though. The biggest problem of the first was him staying in Iron Man's shadow and it being a duo movie. The end of homecoming and Iron Man's death gave him the opportunity to grow and be his own. This doesn't change at all in this film. We see a villain who is a villain only because of Tony Stark and is not correlated to spider-man. Mysterio just does not feel like he is Spider-man's villain. The movie mentions Iron Man consistently and focuses on him a ton. Except for the relationship with MJ, nothing seems to move forwards.

1915,28 August 2019,D4mnDaniel,6," After rewatching all Spider-man saga I finally understand that Far From Home is perfect movie for nickelodeon.
","First of all, I'm huge Spidey fan, I like Tom Holland, he is perfect as Peter Parker and as Spidey and FFH really great movie, but I don't like what's going right now in this universe compared to the other Spidey movies. I see that Jon Watts doesn't bother the superhero stuff and he want to do what he can do best - teen comedy. You all know that bad trip Mysterio what a damn bad ass scene but the other things sucks and it sucks so much that is actually..... hmm embarrassing? Jon Watts really has no excitement to play with setting, no entertaining fight scenes, it feels like some random dudes made action scenes because they needed to put somewhere the superhero stuff. But who cares when the last fight in the movie about Spider-Man and Mysterio was fight with drones. Is this what Spidey deserves? REALLY? It would be ok if it was creative. With London's awesome architecture you can give something cool but no. The CGI Spidey jumping around the drones is ""much cooler"". No improvements after Homecoming. Tom's Peter as was a little and pretty Mary Sue, as it is now. It was ok in prequel, like they changed uncle Ben to Tony Stark and he showed what is really like to be hero. It was ok in crossovers. But it's not ok to watch in the second time these ""little pretty teens problems"" within universe are impossible. Peter Parker is a legendary character with own drama, own story and with big scale. But Tom's Parker is just a Tony Starks little filler which looking at all pretends nothing. For two movies he didn't made something significant as character, all his decisions doesn't feels like it was made by human. It feels like decisions was made by figure to match canon or something because they seek to be likable all categories of viewers which is disgusting. Like remember Andrew Garfield performance in Spidey, you could praise or hate him or make atleast some kind attitude for what decisions he made because his Parker had an actual personality with his own attribute who could cry, kick some ass, make mistakes by emotional dullness. I believe some will say like ""bUt tOmS sPIdEy only 16 yEArs old aNd aFtEr 20 MILLION MOVIES THEY WILL SHOW TRUE DRAMA 18+"" mmm...

","Having grown up on the comics, cartoons, and now having lived through three cinematic versions of Spider-Man, there's always a lot to live up to. The web-slinger has always been my personal favorite super hero, and he's has a lot of attention in the last few years. I know people have a lot of gripes with them (what else is new) but I truly love the Raimi trilogy, and it will likely always be my favorite. I think that Tom Holland is a much better Spider-Man, but I just loved the Raimi universe so much more. There was a time in which we could go see a Marvel movie and just enjoy a detailed story about one hero, without having to keep up with the tech and story lines of a thousand others. I know, I know, that makes it more like the comic books, but with a new super hero movie launching every three months, can't we ever step away from the big picture and just focus on the protagonist? I say this because I was so excited to see Tom Holland' Spider-Man without the movie being infiltrated by Iron Man. It got to the point that every Marvel movie was basically Iron Man and friends, and that's just not what I'm looking to see. Now, here we are after Tony's death, and I feel like the movie still revolves around him posthumously. With those complaints out of the way, let's talk about the great. The visual effects in Far From Home were stunning, which I feel like isn't always a guarantee. Mysterio was well done and much closer to the comic/cartoon series many of us know and love. I felt like Michael Keaton's version of The Vulture was such a poor departure from one of the greatest villains in the series, and was extremely disappointing. Not so with Quinton Beck. The after credit scenes both packed a wallop, which I feel is very rare. The web-slinging and fighting action was pretty fantastic, though a bit under done in my opinion. All in all a very solid film and much better than Homecoming.

1986,10 July 2019,rstarzecmoviecritic,7," Clashing Romantic Comedy and Marvel
","Is Spider-Man: Far From Home one of the best films to come out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe? Well, no, but does it provide quality entertainment that we expect from Marvel Studios in 2019? Yes and no. Comparing Tom Holland's Spider-Man to the previous live-action Spider-Men (Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield) is a difficult process. He fits the role well since Holland looks like a toddler in comparison to both Maguire and Garfield, and we can actually believe that he is a high school student as he should be (with the exception of Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man 3, in which Maguire plays Peter Parker in his college years).
Getting an actor who looks the part is one thing, but just like with Homecoming, the writers of Far From Home try to throw rapid-fire jokes at the audience like Groucho Marx, and in the first hour of the film, about ninety percent of these jokes fall flat. Granted, most of the attempts at humor are not necessarily ""cringe-worthy"" bad; they just fail to hit the mark. Perhaps the writers are catering the humor in the film more towards teenagers than the general public since a lot of the humor revolves around relationships between students on the vacation and the awkwardness that can come from such relationships. This movie is like a teenage romantic comedy combined with a Marvel Studios film.
Okay, so the comedy in the film seems to be overplayed, but what about the general story? The story in Far From Home proves to be a big improvement from Homecoming, even though certain aspects are unoriginal in the superhero genre. When Iron Man 3 was released, critics were comparing Guy Pearce's villain to Syndrome from The Incredibles. Without giving too much away, the same argument can be made about the villain in this film, so now we have two Syndrome knock-offs in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Or maybe Syndrome should be considered a knock-off of these villains if this is how the villains were portrayed in the comics?
Peter's part of the story, however, turns out to be a great feature of this movie. As noted above, Far From Home plays out as a romantic comedy for teenagers, so naturally, a lot of this movie deals with Peter's interest in M.J. and his adorably awkward way he goes about trying to get her attention. Since a lot of Peter's character arc deals with what he would rather focus on (M.J. or being Spider-Man) it proves to be a similar - though not identical - character arc to the one featured in Spider-Man 2, the best Spider-Man movie to date.
In terms of visuals and filmmaking, Far From Home proves to be pretty spectacular. The ""fight scenes"" between Spider-Man and the main villain are jaw-dropping and almost frightening since they have the audience constantly questioning what is real and whether or not the audience is on an acid trip during these sequences (not even kidding). It is beyond impressive - the editing, cinematography, and special effects blend together in these nightmarish sequences to put the audience at a feeling of unease.
Far From Home surpasses Homecoming in quality, but it is neither the best of the best nor the worst of the worst in terms of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is a solid movie that tries to jam humor down your throat early on, but gradually becomes a well-rounded cinematic experience towards its second half.

","It's so refreshing to see Spider-man: Homecoming, especially after a 30 hour marathon of the MCU where most of the battles involve world threatening villains and rays of light to the sky; and the biggest superhero of them all is so local, he's our friendly neighborhood Spider-man and stays close to the ground fighting a local villain with real intentions you can even sympathize with him. But then Far From Home rips all that and tries to duplicate the villain's motivations along with big battles that make you wonder where are the rest of the 20 superheroes that probably would fight whatever Peter doesn't want to.
I kinda blame Endgame for the weight that whatever follow up movie had to carry and all the answers it had to provide, cause that leaves us with the biggest coincidence in the MCU which is that all of Peter's friends (and family) disappeared with the snap and they returned just that they can take a random trip to Europe.

Tom is great, I don't know maybe too many fans of him praised him from long long ago, and I was impressed? But he really IS great. I like his humble(?) look/attitude(?) and done a great job.

","I'm just going to jump right into and I don't really like starting off negatively, but 10-15 minute in I wasn't feeling it. Right out of the gate the whole Michelle/Peter relationship was super forced. Was there a Spider-Man 1.5 shown somewhere and I missed the part where all of a sudden everyone wants to be with Michelle? Nobody was interested in her in Homecoming and she was just comic relief. Also I don't recall her even being called Michelle in this one. Sorry but she's not Mary Jane, so why the need to even call her MJ at all? Also that whole taking her swinging through the city was unnecessary and made no sense which leads to another complaint. Next problem I had was the amount of times and time spent by Peter unmasked. When the post credits identity reveal happened it was like who doesn't know at this point. If he wouldn't have instantly ripped that mask off as soon as he entered the room with Beck and SHIELD he wouldn't have a problem. That all just seems very uncharacteristic of Peter Parker since he keeps his secret identity very secret in comics. Happy even gives away Spidey's identity in the vault when he says he has a thing for Spider-Man's aunt. When those kids see him with May they are going to know that's Peter's aunt. Marvel seems to be replacing Uncle Ben with Tony Stark as well. I get the Uncle Ben thing has been shown and told several times, but it's still a key part of the character and I want ""With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility."" The kicker was showing the initials on the suitcase and then blowing up the plane later. I don't need or want Spider-Man to be the next Iron Man, I just want him to be Spider-Man. On to the positive aka MYSTERIO! The Mysterio stuff was great and brought this True Believer back into the movie. The changes made to his character made sense and worked for me. The parts where he had Spider-Man trapped in the illusions were awesome. Those scenes made the movie for me along with JK Simmons back as J Jonah Jameson! I hope Mysterio's death was an illusion as well and he comes back later. I'm glad the multiverse thing was a lie, it's too early for all that stuff. The Skrull and Fury post credit thing threw me for a loop and confuses me. Where is Fury and why is he working with Skrulls? When Spider-Man was shown in Civil War I was really excited for him being added to the MCU and before Homecoming I'd put Civil War on just to skip to his part. Since Homecoming and now Far From Home I feel let down. Marvel seems to be trying really hard to be different than previous iterations and the character/story is suffering.

","Spiderman far from home is very funny and enjoyable film it has all of marvel trademarks. I think Tom Hollands performance is excellent,his chemistry with Zendaya in there love story is great and natural but what happened to Peters former love she is not mentioned once and we don't know what has happened to her. Samuel L Jackson offers some of the best one liners in the film however the twist that he wasn't there and the scrolls were doing his job was weird and i guess was ment to be funny but it did not work for me.Jake Gyllenhaal performance is great and the illusion scene is my favourite scene in the film. The scenes with myistero giving Peter advice on life before he turns bad got me emotional invested it the film. The fact however that we got another villain that is out to get Tony and not Peter felt lazy and less impactful compared to homecoming since Tony is dead and not in the movie. The final battle was ok but lacked any stakes since Peter was just destroying drones. THE BIG TWIST in the post credits while shocking and accomplishing its goal felt like lazy writing to me, Peter in the is very different to any other hero in the MCU because he is the only one who has to keep his identity safe to continue his every day life and now that has been Taken away from him he is one step closer to being a poor mans iron man however this twist does make me want to see spiderman 3 and does open a interesting road of stories for the next film and phase 4 in general. Overall i really enjoyed the film and recommend it if you enjoy superhero films the acting is great especially Tom Holland and Jake Gyllenhaal, the film is very funny and light hearted has some good action even though it lacks any stakes most of the time. I think were the movie falls down is its lazy writing mystero being another upset employee of Tony stark is just lazy and repetitive and the twist at the well.. i have already made my point on that.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

2090,21 November 2019,ansonbehind,8," The transition of an era
","""For the next Tony Stark, I trust you"". Spiderman Far From Home basically created the whole sequel by this quote from the only Ironman who has sacrificed himself for the greater good of mankind. This sequel is also the end of the Marvel Cinematic Universe 10 year era, marking the end of the remarkable story and hinting of the beginning of another chapter. Spiderman at first was just a freshman from high school until one day he was bitten by a spider then gained superhuman powers. He was then recruited by Tony Stark to aid him during the civil war with Team Captain America and that is how he gained his reputation as a superhero and joined the Avengers during the events of Infinity War.
Spiderman Far From Home is the next Marvel movie established after the events of Avengers Endgame. The whole movie is talking about the life after the heroic sacrifice of Tony Stark, also known as Ironman in bringing back all the lives that has been taken by the snap of the cold-blooded Thanos. With the absence of Ironman, Captain America and Natasha Romanoff in the current world, everyone is asking who will be the leader for the Avengers team, and the spotlight all went to Tony Stark's disciple, Peter Parker also known as Spiderman. The mountain was too high for him to climb and he did all his best to run away from his responsibilities. Instead of saving the world, Peter Parker went on a summer vacation with all his classmates. During his vacation, danger strikes again in the form of the water element and has endangered the safety of his classmates. While dealing with the first enemy, an unknown ally came to help and fortunately no casualties were caused. The unknown hero flew away after defeating the water elemental and has left everyone at the scene thinking who is that guy? The attack worried Peter but he tried not to think about it, but everything changed when Nick Fury showed up in his apartment after darting Ned to sleep. Fury brought Peter to the his hideout, along the way, he gave Peter a pair of glasses named EDITH (Even Dead, I'm The Hero), which was given by Tony Stark. Edith was an augmented reality security, defence and artificial tactical intelligence system. At first, it was meant to be a parting gift from Tony Stark himself, but this gift turns out to be the start of all catastrophe.
In this movie, there are a few scenes that are worth mentioning. The first scene that I want to talk about is the scene where Spiderman is getting swarmed by interviewers during a welcome party for all those who went into the ""Blip"". The scene was shot through the shoulders of Spiderman, representing his point of view during the moment of chaos. It also expresses the emotions of Spiderman during that moment. Feeling of unworthiness, avoidance, fear and stress all came to him and in the end he flew up to the roof, facing a portrait of Tony Stark. At that moment, he just wants to be a regular high school kid, with no pressure of saving the world, no monsters to beat, no cities to save.
Second scene that is worth mentioning is the scene where Quentin Beck also known as Mysterio, the villain of the sequel request to buy Peter a drink after their victory against the fearsome Fire Elemental. Quentin Beck was a former worker for the Stark Industries, but inventions of abusing the augmented reality was claimed useless by Tony Stark, therefore he seeks revenge by getting his hands onto EDITH to show the world that you can be the hero that everyone wanted in the augmented reality world. The scene was shot with the 2 characters present at the hologram bar, which was disguised by augmented reality. Quentin know that Peter has the glasses, therefore he created a series of psychological strategies to bait Peter in giving him the glasses without hesitation. Firstly, Quentin starts off his strategy by asking what he really want, Peter avoids the question at first but in the end stresses that he wants to confess to the girl that he liked for a long time, making Peter lower down his self-defence towards him. Secondly, Peter didn't know that he lost his glasses, but Quentin could not gain access due to encrypted code of the user itself, the transfer of users must be confirmed by the user itself in order to complete the transition. Quentin arranged a helper to pick up the lost glasses and gave it to Peter as it was really found lost outside the city during their fight. After that, Quentin asks Peter to put on the glasses, but then jokingly say that he looks ugly on the glasses. The reason that Quentin uses this strategy is to let Peter feel that he is unworthy of that multi-billion technology that Tony passed on to him. He made Peter think off the quote that Tony gave him, but he misunderstood the underlying meaning of it. In the end, Peter gave Quentin the access of the technology then ran off to fulfil his plan in getting the girl that he loved. The scene shows us that Quentin is a master of phycology, he manipulated the emotions and thoughts of Peter and made him look like a clown. On the other hand, we can also say that teenagers nowadays feel very insecure of themselves, they are easily broken down by harsh words and stress, making them easy to manipulate, easy to put their trust on others.
In a nutshell, this sequel is demonstrating how a teenager manages himself when all the stress and responsibility are thrown towards him. They chose to run, hide, avoid everything that they possibly can, but things come eventually and they will go into a mental breakdown state. However, people always adapt, they will eventually know that the best way to embrace your responsibilities is to conquer them. Secondly, this film also showcases the transition of an era, with all the old faces disappearing from the big screen, it is indicating that Marvel wants a change of new blood into the upcoming Marvel era, introducing more superheroes into the squad. Thirdly, the film also showed us that teenagers are easily deceived and manipulated, therefore the film also serve a purpose to remind teenagers about how cruel the outside world is, everyone will risk everything to get what they want.

","In this movie it's sadly clear that some actors really are giving their all to their role ... and some just do it as a ""job"" to get paid.
I have the highest respect for Jake Gyllenhaal in general, and I understand his wish to not take just any role in the MU out of a kind of respect for his own limitations. But sadly, even though he said he liked to play a vilian, he just lacks the ability to sound really credible and natural .. as for example Tom Holland or RDJ. But to be fair, he was not as bad as some of the minor roles like Peter Parkers classmates (expect MJ) or the female Shield agent giving Peter the stealth suit.
But if you can look past this and just enjoy the movie for the shear joy of another MU movie with all the special effects and all the Spiderman we missed so much with Tobey, then you will for sure enjoy this movie ... and not just one time.
Perhaps it's time to stop using big stars when casting new MU characters, but just look for who really can make a character come to life in the best possible way. Since the cliffhanger in the end of this movie did almost ""promise"" another Spiderman Home-movie, we can just hope that they take the chance to introduce some more new fresh blood (as good as RDJ in first Ironman, Scarlett Johansson in IM2 or Chris Hemsworth in Thor) in order to avoid burning out the already melted candles that Chris H,Chris E or even Jon Favreau has shown examples of in Avengers Endgame or SFFH.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

I found that Spider-Man: Far from Home is a kind of teen movie and it is entertaining. First half of the movie gives me headache but second half was awesome. I really enjoyed and often cheered in second half of this movie. In the first half as usual a teen movie these show us high school journey. But shouldn't be a ordinary journey. It set after Avenger Endgame. So there lot to explore what happened after Endgame. But these movie parody it and I didn't like it. Instead of exploring us with people after Endgame its simply exploring Peter Parker high school journey then it start adventure which was a total headache. There lot of character in the high school get more screen time. They are the side character and unfortunately MJ was one of them. There most of job was only react. It was bad for me. Then the movie start with full speed when Mysterio revealed himself. Beginning of the second half is heart of this movie. Mysterio was great in this movie. But there are marvel effect on Mysterio. There lot of teen stuff also there . Then plot twist. Then movie end with happy ending. I must say that second half of this movie was mustwatch. So I review it 7/10.

2167,10 July 2019,montesdeocasofi,4," Far From a Good Movie
","When I first walked into the cinema, I had high expectations for this movie. I mean, having seen all the trailers and TV spots a billion times, who couldn´t? Spiderman Far From Home was set to kick start a new era in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but instead, it just made me wish I could go back in time and un-see it.
The first trailers gave us an insight in what could possibly lead into a multiverse. Not only was this fake, but it also crushed any possibility for Sony to have a viable excuse to integrate Miles Morales and the Osborn duo to the MCU. But these are not all the disappointments.
The movie relies heavily on comedy, trying to make the fans laugh to distract from the fact that Ned, a kid who was able to hack into Stark Level technology, is put off as a lovesick sidekick who does nothing to help Peter with his troubles until the last ten minutes of the movie. Furthermore, his troubles commence with Parker´s idea to tell MJ that he likes her. Since when? In Homecoming, Zendaya´s character appears five times at most, often making fun of Peter in a teasing manner. So, with no extra footage of how they got talking or how on Earth both him and Ned know her favorite flower and why, we´re expected to believe that he´s into her? Talking about out of the blue romances, where did Happy and May come from if both only met shortly after the events of Endgame.
Moving on, the whole plot of the movie is based around Peter falling into Tony´s legacy, ignoring the fact that Peter is his own person. Along these lines, every mention of Tony´s late mentor gave a chance to explore Spiderman´s PTSD and Anxiety over the events of his last 3 movies, from a warehouse falling on him to the death of hist most recent father figure.
To be honest, the only thing that really salvage is Happy´s relationship with Peter. Hogan respects the kid and helps him figure himself out while nudging towards the kind, thoughtful and strong person he is destined to become. The first post-credit scene, while entertaining, also left a sense of unfulfillment from the movie. Yeah, who didn´t want a J. Jonah Jameson in the movie? But that didn´t mean we wanted Peter´s identity exposed. So, what, is he going to run around mask less now? The final scene, on the other hand, is actually funny, while not leaving any loose ropes.
To conclude, the movie shows (while not even putting the quote in) that with great power comes great responsibility. And apparently, Kevin Feige and John Watts weren´t able to handle it.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

2177,10 July 2019,maribri-01381,7," Spider-Man: Far From Home ~ Entertaining, but not quite memorable
","Directed by Jon Watts, this superhero movie disguised as a teen romance tells the story of the events after Avengers: Endgame. Spider-Man, played by Tom Holland, is overwhelmed by the fact that he has to step up in Tony Stark's shoes, although what he really wants is just a vacation away from all the superhero stuff, where he plans to confess his feelings towards MJ, portrayed by Zendaya.
Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio was perfect, I just wish his story arc was presented more in-depth, I wish they would've offered us more info about his backstory, what actually was given to us being a brief presentation of his origins. The twist consisting of him actually being the villain was predictable, considering that the trailer showed Spidey teaming up with him. Some particular scenes make absolutely no sense, this aspect being masked with comedy,hoping you will forget the weak-ish plot.
I liked the fact that the movie was pretty well balanced, Peter always being caught up in some fights, which would interrupt the few chances he had to tell MJ how he feels about her. The action scenes were a lot more intense than the ones in Homecoming, they seemed more confident this time. My favourite part was when Spidey had to fight Mysterio's illusions. That scene looked amazing. Another satisfying aspect was seeing Peter act just like Tony while designing his new suit.
Leaving behind the heavily predictable storyline, the post credit scene was pretty great, I'm really looking forward to see what they will do in the next movie, leaving us with a cliffhanger, while the end credits scene was absolutely unnecessary. I must say that I would've liked to see how they handle the fact that MJ knows Spider-Man's true identity a bit more, the post credit scene revealing his secret seeming maybe a tiny bit rushed.
Overall, I had fun watching this light, comedy filled movie, but I couldn't not notice the obvious flaws: predictability, plot holes, weak-ish storyline and I wish I would've seen more of Mysterio.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

",When people said this was the best Spider-Man movie ever it caught my attention. I mean when people said that you got very high standards to beat by the likes of the first two Sami Raimi movies and Into the Spiderverse. And in my opinion it didn't reach those standards at all. Spider-Man 2 still sits high above the rest as the best Spider-Man movie of all time. Don't get me wrong Far from Home isn't a bad movie at all it is a good movie but this movie is all over the place in my mind. I mean you got flying drones and you got cuts from place to place all over there's also a lot of technology based stuff in this movie like Homecoming. Spider-Man should be a more grounded type hero like they did greatly in the Raimi trilogy. Tom Holland is a fantastic Spider-Man I hope he has 20 more movies as Spider-Man and I loved Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio. The Mysterio mind game scenes with Spider-Man was the best stuff about this movie. But the reasoning for Mysterio being a villain in the first place should have been a little more dug into. The MJ and Peter scenes were pretty good. They shouldn't have spoiled that she knew peter was Spider-Man in the trailer but it is what it is. I feel like the MCU is too empty. Give little feelers like what's too come. If they continue to do Spider-Man in this universe and not tease villains like The Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus I will be extremely disappointed. They never teased any of those villains at all in this movie. I mean it was awesome to see J.K. Simmons again as J. Jonah Jameson again. But this Spidey universe should be more fleshed out. Hell tease the next Marvel big bad as Galactus. Show that Oscorp bought out the Avengers tower. Next to Batman Spider-Man has the best rogues gallery in all of comics so take advantage of that. It's just all the transitions and a lot of characters were extremely Annoying and untolarable in this film that I thought Homecoming was a better movie. This movie still stands high above Spider-Man 3 and the two Mark Webb movies though. Maybe If I see this movie for a second time my opinion will be different but in the end I was let down after exiting the movie theater.

","Tom Holland may arguably be the best Spider-Man ever, as he showed in his previous entries in the MCU and not only acting wise, that is. He proved his ability to deliver a chaotic, but very likable Spider-Man over five movies. And Far from Home is defiantly no exception. It contains not only strong performances from Holland, but Gyllanhall doesn't disappoint either. What else to expect from a Hollywood giant though. The visuals are breathtakingly realistic and the supporting cast does its job quite well. They play a major part in moving the film forward, but the only question is, where to? The poorly answerd attempt of solving that problem might be the movies only issue. The story and story telling. Mainly due to Gyllenhalls villain, whose own character arc is just not convincing, but feels strongly constructed as well. And since a hero is only as good as their counterpart, which's backstory just doesn't work in this case, this movie has a hard job at making us believe it's the more-than-average Marvel movie...quite frankly, it doesn't succeed.

2226,16 September 2019,kabirz,4," Far from being a great spidey sequel!
","The MCU Spidey's second installment is just another spidey movie for MCU Fans. The only thing best about this movie is the antagonist i.e. Jake Gyllenhaal's ""Mysterio"" and if anyone doesn't know his character that means they are living under a rock, i.e. which already gives away the suspense this movie holds in the middle of the second act. Overall the film can said to be really a ""step up"" far from the first one in the means of action, otherwise the storytelling, the plot, the subplot and the development is very very poor for a ""Spider-man"" oriented movie. The only good scenes are the two scenes, one which we see in the second act and one which comes after the mid credits. The unexpected cliffhanger is just so annoying as the one which we saw in the end of the first movie. In the end, it's just a movie for a better treatment after the dealing with MCU's infinity saga's conclusion.",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019

Twenty-three films, dozens of different characters, millions of fans around the world and billions in box office receipts - isn't that a force? But, as we know from the words of the wise Uncle Ben (a character whose existence is safely forgotten for the second time in a row), along with such great power comes colossal responsibility. Disney is well aware of this and therefore decides to share this responsibility with someone else.

2245,17 November 2019,Livingdale21587,5," An unfavorable start of the post-Endgame era.
","After watching this movie, I writhed and writhed in bed, unable to go to sleep, my mind filled with all the non-sensical happenings that I had just witnessed. Let me discuss a few instances here.
Having defeated the fire monster in Prague, Beck and Peter decide to have a drink in the local bar, the latter with his mask off. My question is, what if someone in the bar recognizes the glowing guy and the kid in the black suit, who just saved the town? What if they take a photo of them and post it online, revealing Peter as The Night Monkey to pretty much the entire world? Is Peter that comfortable with showing his face in the public?
Another major gripe I have about the story is the fact that Peter, fully cognizant of its capabilities,decides to give EDITH to a guy he barely knows-- what the living hell? Remember Project Insight in Captain America: The Winter Soldier? Well, it doesn't even hold a candle to EDITH. In my opinion, a tech as powerful and dangerous as EDITH shouldn't be owned by anyone. It's infuriating how careless and stupid his decision is.
After Peter realizes that Beck is a liar and gets tricked into telling him with whom he's shared this information, I can't believe he doesn't even try to alert Ned and MJ about the danger they are in. And since he now knows Beck can deceive people with ease, why doesn't he take any precautions? For example, he can tell Happy to hire a bus to take his classmates for protection. It shouldn't be difficult, considering that Happy has a plane at his disposal (indicating adequate wealth), not to mention how gullible and easy to manipulate Mr. Harrington is. Speaking of Mr. Harrington, I'm flabbergasted that, when the water monster shows up in London, he keeps bickering with Mr. Dell instead of leading the kids immediately off the bus and away from the bridge, which could be flooded or even torn down any minute. Life-and-death responsibility is elided in favor of so-called ""humor.""
Oh, right, one more thing: Where are the police in Europe? I don't recall seeing even one police car when the monsters are wrecking havoc, not in Venice, not in Prague, and certainly not in London. Maybe the police in the MCU have a special protocol of not responding to situations like this, in order to clear the stage for the superheroes who can then provide the audiences with flashy action sequences and make them say: ""Wow, the VFX are so cool! Ticket money well spent! Who cares how the real world works?"" In reality, I'm pretty sure there would be police cars, police choppers, news choppers and fire engines everywhere when such a catastophe is going down.
I can see that Tom Holland tried his best to play this role. However, his earnestness as well as Jake Gyllenhall's brilliance are wasted in this movie, because the story fails to make much sense. The Dark Knight is great for a number of things and one of them is the excellently-written screenplay. It's realistic, well thought-out, and has stood the test of time. It pains me to trash on this movie and a lot of people will probably hate me for doing so, but I simply cannot turn a blind eye to all its problems and say: ""Yeah, this is solid entertainment. Give me more movies like this please.""",/review/rw4974512/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Far_from_Home_2019
