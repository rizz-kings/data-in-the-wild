","Spider-Fans are a thick-skinned lot. And, in watching his attempts to crawl onto the big screen, we've taken some gut-punches. From the early, fun-but-twee Sam Raimi days to the murky, Marc Webb hipster days (to say nothing of the nightmare of 'Dancing Emo Peter' - a farce of idiocy the character will be lucky to ever shrug off), we've watched our boy take more beats than a bout with Doctor Octopus. So, even finally(!) reacquainted with his REAL parents - a Marvellous accomplishment in itself - dare we hope? In the face of so much misguided corporate overreach, hackneyed tonal imbalance, flagrant disregard for comic backstory, and (shudder) hip-thrusts, dare we dream the dream of a half-decent cinematic Spider-Man, for the first time in more than some viewers' lifetimes?

","The friendly neighborhood Spider-man is back and better than ever. Hearing about another Spider- man movie being rebooted within 15 years after Sam Raimi's films and The Amazing Spider man being the second reboot. The thought of seeing the origin story for a third time would have been exhausting seeing another adaptation of Peter Parker taking the big responsibility of being a hero and witnessing Uncle Ben being killed off. However, Spider-Man: Homecoming takes place after Captain America Civil War and no background story to how Peter Parker became the webslinging hero. Homecoming works well more as a coming of age movie as Peter Parker is going through his sophomore year of high school and wanting to have a bigger purpose in joining the Avengers.

","I am not going to lie, I really like Spider-man, he is my favorite comic book hero. So, this film could be considered bad by most people, but I am still going to like it. Heck, I even enjoyed the two James Garfield Spider-man films. Here, we have another reboot, but this time it is a bit different as this Spider-man has already been introduced to us in last year's Captain America: Civil War. It also does something different than other superhero stories as we do not have to witness the whole origin thing again! I was relieved as I did not want to see Uncle Ben die again and I do think t hat most of us are pretty familiar with how Peter Parker became Spider-man. This time we are also treated to a fairly upbeat Spider-man film as well. No tragic death after tragic death in this one as this one maintains a more positive vibe throughout. Which is good for me as I had to deal with a very harsh personal tragedy and I really do not care to deal with more, even in film. It is strange that they seem to insist on making Peter Parker younger each time though seeing as how in the main cannon of comics he was maybe in high school briefly at the start as when I was reading it he was in college and working for the Daily Bugle; however, at least the high school he is in is one for more intelligent kids so they at least factor in his intelligence.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

","This seems to get to the action instead of messing around telling the same story over again and it is great that Peter is still in school who has got his eye on someone else Liz who is a nice girl, nevertheless the romance damsel in distress does not get in the way of the film like the previous Spider Man. I like the way that the have changed Mary Jane Watson to Michelle Jones as her friend call her ""MJ"" that we find that out at the end of the film draftee her starting to come out of he shell and open up to Peter A Bit. MJ is completely different character in so many ways a bit of a diva at times and a strong independent girl who keeps to herself and has a shy side and is really lovely and kind when she takes down her barrier and you get to know her, which really does build up the plot, which is instead of putting the typical MJ And Peter Parker love Story together that is just not reality. Loved the Father And Son relationship between Peter Parker And Tony Stark really shows him as a father figure and really does connote the next few films. I would strongly recommend watching this as they have done an amazing job of getting the story right after those other failed moves and the bad guy in this movie is kind of a reference to the green goblin with the green eyes but instead with wings who perter does not know that is so interesting to watch that unfold. Spider Man in the MCU as an Avenger is about time well done Tom Holland And Zendaya and the rest of the cast and crew for doing such an amazing job as all my doubts are gone now and Spider Man is one of my favourite Super Heroes out of the MCU next to Iron Man what a call duo.

","Look out folks, we've got another Spider-Man movie swinging into theaters! While most are excited to see their friendly neighborhood hero back for another reboot, I bet a lot are groaning, questioning why another retelling of the web-slinger is necessary. It has to do with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While Disney has been hitting home run after home run with the rest of the capes, Spider-Man was one of the few characters (at least with movie rights) that Disney couldn't work with.

","Jon Watts (Director of Clown and Cop Car) perfects the character and charm of Spider-Man that we all love from the comics without doing disservice to either fans of both the Raimi and Amazing Spider-Man franchises with a fun superhero movie oozing with joy with its great cast and characters, big and small, as well as an 'amazing' performance from Tom Holland who brilliantly combines what Maguire and Garfield brought to the character by truly demonstrating the differences and similarities between the awkward nerd Peter Parker and the quippy crime fighting Spider-Man. The film also gives many critics of Marvel's lack of great villains what they want most, a relatable villain that is as, if not more, interesting than the hero itself and not only is great adversary physically but also psychologically and we see this with Michael Keaton's excellent portrayal of the Vulture. What Spider-Man: Homecoming does best, however, is its attention to detail and world building put into the town of Queens, which feels more real and believable than any other fictional world we have seen in the MCU, making Spider-Man: Homecoming one of the best chapters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and another great example for future superhero movies to learn from.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

Michael Keaton as Vulture the main villain also very refreshing when he not a ultra powerful guy who lust for power that want to control the world like many previous Marvel villain but this time a man try his best to support his family.The movie end with a lot of question but if the Spider Man future franchise keep going like this i will be pleased",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

30,29 June 2020,andrewnmiller,10," A breath of fresh air for Marvel's prodigal son.
","Following the massive underperformance of the Amazing Spiderman 2 in 2014, Sony Pictures was in a difficult position as while the Spiderman films were still making good money at the box-office, something needed to be done to shake things up on the filmmaking side of things as the company had no intent to sell the Spiderman rights to Marvel due to their own financial problems but with fan support for Peter Parker to join the MCU growing louder, it became obvious that Sony would need help with the future of Spiderman on film. As it turned out, Marvel Studios was already willing to lead Sony a helping hand long before any of their shared universe plans could be put into motion. Due to their grip on the Spiderman merchandise, Disney was far more willing to promote the Spiderman films that Sony was making then they were with the X-Men and Fantastic 4 films 20th Century Fox were making at the time. Nevertheless, Marvel still had an interest in binging the webhead into their cinematic universe in order to provide a strong foundation for the MCU after the end of Phase 3. Despite being reluctant to work with Marvel, Sony head honchos Tom Rothman and Amy Pascal decided that a deal where Spiderman would appear in an MCU film in return for an MCU character making a camo in one of their Spiderman spin-off films would be perfect as this would allow Marvel Studios to produce a trio of Spiderman films for Sony all while allowing them to maintain creative control, marketing, and distribution as well as breathing new life back into the brand. However, a massive rift of corporate safety was about to force Sony to make a deal between them and Marvel.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

37,7 July 2017,Screen_Blitz,8," Fun, charming comic-book adventure that proudly handles justice for the titular hero
","Our friendly neighborhood Spiderman has made his return to the big screen, and he is more charming than ever. With the filmmaking rights now handed to Marvel Studios from Columbia Pictures, the titular hero is gained membership to the Marvel Cinematic Universe with a more unique approach unlike what he saw in the Sam Raimi trilogy or the underwhelming reboot series starring Andrew Garfield. With the days of Garfield as the web-slinging hero now three years in the rear-view mirror, this comic-book adventure helms Tom Holland in the role of the title character, after advertising a spectacular introduction in last year's 'Captain America: Civil War'. And the director responsible of this project is Jon Watts who grants the hero with a more zany approach than what we were accustomed to in the past, in attempt to connect him to the MCU's Avengers team. This also allows for brief appearances by MCU veterans such as Iron Man and even briefer ones by Chris Evans's Captain America. Following the events of Civil War, this film follows 15-year old Peter Parker (played by Tom Holland), a geeky high schooler struggling to balance his social life at school with his best friend Ned (played by Jacob Batalon), and his time crime-fighting as the titular web-slinging superhero which he hides of Aunt May (played by Marisa Tomei). Under the watchful, if overprotective eye of Tony Stark/Iron Man (played by Robert Downey Jr.), Peter must prove he is worthy of becoming the hero Tony wants him to be, as well as making a good impression of his crush Liz (played by Laura Harrier), when he faces down the evil Vulture (played by Michael Keaton) who is in possession of some dangerous weapons.

","How many Spider-Mans can you get to climb the wall and save New York City? Apparently 3. With the original 3 movies with Tobey Maguire putting on the web slinging red and blue costume to save New York City from the evil threat of corporate America, those were pretty good. And then there was Andrew Garfield – battling an electric man and a crazed lizard dude who both were wanting more power. And now, certified fresh from Rotten Tomatoes, Tom Holland is the new friendly neighborhood Spider-Man in Homecoming. Dealing with a threat bigger and badder than ever. Michael Keaton does an incredible job portraying a mechanical flying bird stealing from none other than Tony Stark and the Avengers. Let's rewind a bit, we were introduced to Spider-Man towards the middle of Captain America: Civil War when a battle was looming between the Avengers and the Captain and his team because of a threat to expose the existence of the superheroes for what they truly are. Now let's come back to this movie, leading an all-star cast Tom Holland is the new face of the web-slinging, crime fighting superhero who has to come to terms of his identity and how to save humanity and New York City.

55,12 July 2017,ironhorse_iv,8," Spiderman swing back into action, and for the most part. It was alright.
","Welcome Home, Spiderman! Nice to see you back! However, you weren't really gone for that long. After all, there has five films featuring him in the last 15 years, with two reboots. You were pretty much, everywhere. So, coming into 'Spider-Man: Homecoming"", I was really, wasn't looking forward to your movie. I was really, feeling the superhero fatigue, after the last two films about you, 2012's 'The Amazing Spiderman' & 2014's 'The Amazing Spiderman 2' kinda disappointed me at parts. Nor, was I looking forward to watching the 'The Sinister Six' spin-off film, which eventually got cancelled by Sony Pictures, but after hearing that Sony was allowing you to join the Marvel Studios Cinematic Universe in a cameo appearance in 2016's 'Captain America: Civil War'. It got some of my Spiderman sense tingling. However, I was still, a bit off-putting on the fact that I have to watch, yet another retelling of the Friendly Neighborhood Spiderman comics, origin story. I really had mixed feelings, coming into this film, because of that; but thank goodness, after watching, this movie, directed by Jon Watts, I felt astonishment that the film avoid the tiresome exposition on how Peter Parker (Tom Holland) became bitten by a radioactive/genetically-altered spider to become, Spider-Man. It totally skip it to tell something new. Now, Spider-Man is, like Iron-Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr), in which, his suit gives him, most of his powers. It gave the character, a lot of new abilities and move-sets, such as controlling drone-size flying spiders, and choosing different types of web projectiles, while also somewhat limiting him, in his ability to trust his natural instincts & problem solving skills. It was a unique approach to adapting the character from the comics. Still, the action was not that memorable. I thought, the film could had done, a lot better. It was a little too CGI heavy. Also, it was a bit, odd to see Spiderman talk to an intelligence assistant named 'Karen' (Voiced by Jennifer Connelly) built into the suit about life issues. It really felt, like I was watching a superhero version of 2013's 'Her', at times. Still, I was deeply surprised, how little, the film talk about 'Uncle Ben' passing. You would think, that would affect his life, deeply, but there is no mention of that, at all. Because of that, the character was a lot more enjoyable and charming, but sadly, it also made Tom Holland's Peter, paper-thin. There was barely any character depth, besides the fact, that is Pete is an outsider in high school. I would like to see the sequel, tackle more intense & emotional issues than coming to age issues like him, trying to get with a girl and being popular in school. Another problem, with the film, is the fact, that they focus, a little too much on characters from the Iron Man franchise. The fact, that the villain, Adrian Toomes/Vulture (Michael Keaton) has more of a grudge against Iron Man than the title character, makes Spiderman seem, less of the main hero. Don't get me wrong, you can still have the salvager turned into an arms trafficker, but have it, relate more to what Spiderman did, than the Avengers. It would make the film have more stakes. Still, Michael Keaton was great in the role. I just wish, his character, was a little more sinister and darker. As for the supporting cast, it was mostly a miss for me. I found, the classmates of Peter, to be really annoying. Some, good examples is the characters of Ned (Jacob Batalon) & Michelle (Zendaya). There were very unfunny. Some of the jokes, like not wanting to go to Washington Monument due to it, being built by slave-labor was cringe-worthy. It really didn't help the film. If anything, it slow the film, down. Also, the fact, that most of the students, couldn't tell, that he was Spider-Man, is really hard to believe. Thank Goodness, not all the humor was awful. I did like some of the hand-held V-Blog exchanges, between Peter and Happy Hogan (Jon Favereau) & the hot jokes with Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) were kinda funny. Also, some of the cameos in the movie like Chris Evans, StanLee, and Gwyneth Paltrow was nice to see. As for the love-interest, Liz Allen (Laura Harrier). She was very forgettable for the most part, besides the big twist toward the end. It's just seem weird to see the writers, not use, the more famous, Mary Jane Watson or Gwen Stacy, instead. This film is by far, the weakest, in the love-department. As for the music,I like, how much, composer Michael Giacchino interweave a new update version of the original 1960's cartoon TV show theme song to the movie. Still, I like the Danny Elfman's 2002's version, better. I would wish, they reused that. Anyways, unlike this movie, I will be looking forward to Spiderman's appearance in the next MCU movie, 'The Avengers: Infinity Wars'. That's for sure. As for the next single feature. I have high hopes that it will do well, as well. Overall: 'Spiderman: Homecoming' spins a mean enjoyable web. It was entertaining for the most part. Even with some flaws, I highly recommended watching it.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

It's amazing to think that this is the sixth Spider-Man movies in 15 years, and yet this is the first in over a decade that understands this character, in large part making close to the comic books (I haven't read them religiously, but it seems to follow pretty close to the Ultimate run at the least, if not others). I don't know if every action scene is terribly original, but every one has massive stakes for Parker, and yet at the same time they're not the usual apocalyptic, end-of-the-world scenarios that sometimes can make a super-hero movie feel too big, even if the stakes are still strong.

","With the story of several superheroes having been established previously, one important member of the Avengers in the comics spoke, and certainly one of the most popular. Spider-Man was created by editor / writer Stan Lee and writer / artist Steve Ditko, and his first appearance was in the anthology book Amazing Fantasy # 15 (August 1962) and gained even more popularity with previous film adaptations, especially the trilogy directed by Sam Raimi.
Since their film rights are tied to Sony, only now have Sony and Disney made a deal for Spider-Man to appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Tom Holland made his debut as Spider-Man in the 2016 UCM film, Captain America: Civil War, before now starring in his own film, directed by Jon Watts, who had previously been featured with the interesting Clown (2014) and The Vehicle (2015), in addition to writing short films and television series. With this agreement, the subtitle of the feature ""Back to Home"" never made so much sense, referring to one of his stories in the comics and, also making this reference with the return of the character to his home, Marvel.
The most interesting thing about this script written by twelve hands by Jonathan Goldstein, John Francis Daley, Jon Watts, Christopher Ford, Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, is how he manages to draw parallels and make all the connections with other Avengers films, even the insertion effective Spider-Man has occurred late, only in the final phase of phase 3 of the Marvel universe in theaters. Right off the bat, we've gone back eight years in the chronology of the universe, right after the battle of the newly revealed to the world, Avengers, against the alien race Chitauri in New York. Right away, we are already introduced to one of the best known villains in the comics, the Vulture / Adrian Toomes, played here by the always great Michale Keaton, who was once on the other side of the story, as Bruce Wayne, Batman.
Right away, we already know the villain's motivations, with the loss of a millionaire contract with the city to clean the city after the battle with the aliens for the joint venture formed by Stark Industries with the federal government, with the Control Department of Damages starting to supervise the collection and storage of alien materials. From then on, still having possession of an amount of alien technology in hand, Toomes begins to create his hyper-technological flying suit and to earn money by selling this technology to all types of criminals. All of this also awaits revenge with Tony Stark, amid preparations to move to the new headquarters of the Avengers. There is a human history there. The old bank robber, created in The Amazing Spider-Man # 2, undergoes a humanizing adaptation, becoming a figure with more understandable motivations here, even though greed has gone up in the character's head more and more after so long . join him and are gaining prominence throughout the film other enemies already well-known from Cabeça de Teia, such as Shocker, Scorpion and the Builder, all with their well-defined purposes and a lot of work with the scraps of the chitauri that destroyed part of Manhattan in the first Avengers.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

","This was absolutely, without a doubt, the best ""Spider-Man"" movie ever! It's everything I loved about Spider-Man in the comics, cartoons, and video games growing up. It has his signature wisecracks, the fun thrills, and struggles of being a teen that Spidey is famous for. Michael Keaton gives a wonderfully chilling performance as the villain. There is one scene in particular that I won't spoil where his threatening demeanor is enough the frighten even a grown man. Spidey's tech-savvy sidekick also provides some wonderful comic relief. My one complaint was the actress Zendaya. She was so monotone and bored, that I was really starting to regret Disney buying Marvel at some points. (She was a Disney Channel star.) If she had put more emotion into her lines, or had been given better direction, she could have been a more interesting character, but she just came off as bland. I will probably have to watch this movie several times when it hits Bluray, because I spotted some fun little Easter Eggs and inside jokes, and I'm sure there were plenty more that I missed. As always, stay for the very end of the credits. I'm not going to spoil anything, but lets just say that Marvel is starting to become very meta....and that's all I'm going to say about that. It's too good and too funny to spoil.

88,29 April 2018,preparefives,10," SPIDER-MAN HOMECOMIG (2017)
","An American feature film of 2017 directed by John Watts with Tom Holland and Michael Keaton in the lead roles. The script is based on comics by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko of Marvel Comics. World premiere of the picture took place on June 28, 2017 in Hollywood.
The action takes place a few months after the events described in the film ""The First Avenger: Confrontation."" According to the story, Peter Parker is trying to find a balance between school life and to be a Spider-Man, while facing the Vulture.
The best thing about the film is the script (written by John Watts), which is fast and funny. The music's cool. The performances are great.
Would I recommended the film? Yes, I would. It's one of the most interesting comedies I've seen in recent years!

","Surprisingly (or maybe not so for anyone who's confidence in the steadily declining quality-control centre over at Sony hasn't been shaken as much as mine), it's the best Spider-Man film since Sam Raimi's second instalment. Though it's a clear step down from the first two films of that trilogy, it thankfully gives us something we haven't already seen. By skipping the origin and giving us a younger Peter Parker who's less experienced as a web-slinger than ever before (finally, an actor who isn't nearly thirty), it creates a uniquely engaging story and a refreshing change of pace. This time around, the web-head's powers are neutered slightly in favour of a more tech-heavy suit, but the feature also manages to fit his abilities in with his characteristics comfortably. He certainly seems like the same person in and out of the suit, and his movement constantly reflects both his physique and his personality. The villain is a three-dimensional character who feels like a human being with proper motivations and valid emotions while still being menacing. He's the best villain in the series since Doc Ock. There are a number of exciting set-pieces that focus on a lower-stakes kind of spectacle that not only makes narrative sense but feels fresh. The best sequence in the film involves the hero and villain sans suits simply having a cleverly conceived conversation. The feature manages to balance the school stuff with the web-swinging so that the former never encroaches on the latter but also has enough time to feel like it matters. Overall, it's a really fun time when it gets going and is a fine return to form for the web-head. 8/10.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

Maybe it's because Mary Jane isn't in it either. Maybe it's that Spidey's suit has all the different powers and weapons that makes him feel more like Iron Man. But something just feels off about it. It is still a very good movie, and possibly Marvel's funniest to date. Even if he was introduced in Civil War, there's no denying it. Tom Holland is the best Spider-Man. He acts and looks like he's 15, unlike Maguire and Garfield, who were clearly way older than the character they portrayed. Without giving anything away, the climax and ending were absolutely spectacular, both on a visual scale, and the way the character development sorts out. The other characters were good as well. Vulture was one of the best comic book movie villains ever. What's great about him is that you could make the legitimate argument that he's not actually a villain. He's not out to kill Spider-Man or something like that. He's just doing what everyone wants to do - get rich and live an easy life. He doesn't even cause that much damage, making him much more human than other villains. As for the other characters, well... Controversial opinion: Zendaya wasn't funny in this movie, she was annoying. She's a good actress, I know she's a fan favorite, but the whole movie she was trying way too hard to be edgy. It wasn't funny at all. Ned was pretty funny, though. He fills in Harry Osborn's role quite well. Liz wasn't exactly the most memorable character, but she had some good scenes, so she's fine. It really did feel like she was filling in for Mary Jane. You do gotta feel bad for her at the end. Iron Man is in this movie, but he's kind of like a father figure to Spidey here, and it works.

","Let me start by saying Spider-Man Homecoming is an absolute blast. It's everything you could want from a Spider-Man movie. Tom Holland did a fantastic job as Spider-Man. He was an interesting, lovable Peter Parker and an absolutely classic Spider-Man. Michael Keaton was an exceptional vulture. You couldn't ask for a better actor to play him. This also had a lot of very comedic moments so if you enjoy comedies, this would be a good movie to see. This is how Spider-Man should always be. Lovable, funny, kind of awkward and witty and that's exactly what we get from this movie that we didn't fully get in The Amazing Spider-Man movies. I noticed some people were comparing to Spider-Man 2 and saying which one was better. I think they are both awesome but they are also very different in certain ways.

140,9 July 2017,JasonR77,10," Best Spidey to Date
","Spider-Man, at his core, is the original kid superhero. His innocence and naivete are as important as his intellect and wit. After two previous incarnations and five movies, it's this version that finally puts together a truly faithful portrayal of Peter Parker. Fittingly, it took the MCU to do it. Tom Holland eschews the portrayals of his predecessors, and infuses Parker with a genuinely optimistic view of the world, and almost a boy crush on Tony Stark. Peter is awkward, nervous and ambitious, to the point where he nearly wrecks himself in order to show Stark how useful he can be. There is a lot of fun to be had in this movie, be it through Spidey's quips, his amusing interactions with people, or just times where he falls flat while trying to be this great superhero. Peter's classmates get a fair bit more work; this is the most complete Flash ever put to film, and Ned is a perfect best friend for Peter. It's a fast movie as well, and Michael Keaton helps keep that going as the counterbalance, his career renaissance continuing in excellent fashion. Vulture is not the most headline-grabbing Spidey villain, certainly, but neither was Obediah Stane for Iron Man, nor Abomination for Hulk. They worked well because of who portrayed them, and this is another case of that working in the favor of the story. Keaton's motivations are simple, but not the same as a typical villain, which makes him stand out, and potentially shows that the MCU can create guys who are more than one-trick ponies. This movie paces itself well, and just when you think it's safe, it pulls a sharp right on you to bring the final act into focus. There's just enough Tony Stark to bolster the bottom line, without having him take over the film. He's the dad, such as it is, who'd have thought? Iron Man is the interweaving thread in this universe, so it's appropriate he be here, and the aforementioned dad role is amusing and in a way the perfect method to bring Spidey along. Overall, a great time. The stakes aren't as high as they're going to be or have been in MCU movies, but that's okay.

","I am a huge fan of Spiderman, I love the original trilogy (yes even the third one) I really liked Tobey Maguire and felt he did a great job. I think the Andrew Garfield films, while enjoyable, really lacked the tone of a Spiderman film. So I can tell you, this was easily my most anticipated movie of 2017, but I do have to remember that I can't keep my expectations as high as a drug addict. So as the film started, while pumped, I also was just praying it would be awesome. So... I AM VERY HAPPY TO TELL YOU THIS MOVIE IS FANTASTIC!!!!!!! The entire time watching it I had a smile on my face! ☺ First off the acting is great, Tom Holland was born to play this role. All his friends, the villains, and of course Robert Downey Jr did awesome like always. Next the action, the web swinging sequences, the high flying fighting and intensity was all handled so well, Marvel always achieves greatness with that. You can really feel the brutality and fear of the characters while watching. Let's talk about Micheal Keaton as the vulture wow! What an incredible villain! He was very intimidating with the suit on but also, a terrific character underneath the suit. While I am a fan of the MCU I do agree, a majority of their villains suck. But Keaton really was different. He had so much depth and motivation which I adored. And there is one big shocker towards the end which even put more emotional weight towards his character. This movie is not just another marvel movie. Spiderman Homecoming is very unique and special in its own way. Of course the CGI was great like always. The story was written in a way we can all adore. There are so many twists and turns and unexpected paths it chooses to take which was the right direction. And last, the humor was hilarious! Laughter is the best medicine. Peter's friend Ned was a addition that fit like Cinderella's slipper.

","I've read a few reviews and I understood a few complaints especially if you were a 90s kid and haven't been keeping up with all the reboots and whatnot of Spiderman. Toby's Spiderman in 2002 was more of ""Spiderman the animated series"" version of the 90s. If you only remember that spider-man this movie could be kind of disappointing. Me on the other hand, I've been keeping up with all my superheroes that interest me, with spider-man being my favorite, I've been watching the Ultimate Spiderman. He crosses over with the avengers a few episodes, even gets invited to join the avengers down like he was in the movie and turned it down. In the cartoon, Shield gives him all of his gadgets and Iron man gives him this Iron man Spider suit. In the movie, Tony stark is responsible for all of his gadgets. The story is a little different but it works for me. I enjoyed watching the spider-man who actually is a kid unlike other spider-man movies. I expected more from this movie but it still was a 10 out of 10. I think that this movie sets up the next spider-man movie and even sets up the avengers movie maybe. The one thing i probably felt was just totally wrong in this movie is the portrayal of flash Thompson. That was very disappointing.

Tom Holland is the definitive on-screen Peter Parker/Spidey and perfectly embodies the personality, spirit, and youthfulness of the character. Michael Keaton is fantastic as main villain, the Vulture, and is one of Marvel Studios' best antagonists thus far. He is chilling to watch and very intimidating. The rest of the cast give stellar performances, especially Peter's best friend Ned and Aunt May. Robert Downey Jr.'s role is small, but vital to the film's captivating plot and story. The action scenes are breath-taking, and I loved seeing a less-experienced Spider-Man who is just now learning how to use and control his newfound abilities. The movie is also hilarious and probably one of the funniest comic book films so far. I also loved seeing Spidey doing good deeds and committing random acts of kindness around Queens, NY, and the film uses the NYC setting perfectly.

To say this movie came back with just a faint pulse, is an understatement; Spider-Man: Homecoming wears its freaking heart on its sleeves! Back in 2014, Sony and Disney struck a deal to essentially share the character and allow the Web Slinger to be back in Marvel's hands where he belongs.

","After an auspicious cameo in last year's Captain America: Civil War, Spider-Man now has his own standalone feature in the MCU and and I'm happy to report that it more than lives up to the promise of his previous appearance. Spider-Man: Homecoming is the third on- screen iteration of the illustrious web-slinger, as directors Sam Raimi and Marc Webb previously had separate swings at the characters, but in many ways, this seems to be the first version that truly understands what makes the character unique and indispensible in the superhero realm. If Raimi's trilogy exhibited an earnest campiness ripped straight from the comic book pages and Webb's pair of films was brooding retort to the Dark Knight series, then this film casts a lively signature of its own that's defined by soulful storytelling and perfectly pitched humor.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

Peter then learns Liz is moving to Oregon because her father doesn't want them there during the trial.Michelle is elected the new Leader of the Decathlon team is tells them her friends call her MJ making us believe she will be a Mary Jane like character.Tony Stark then offers Peter a spot in the Avengers and a new suit that looks like the Iron Spider suit.Peter declines the offer and continues being a Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man.Tony gives Peter back the suit he made for him and he puts it on and takes off the mask not knowing Aunt May is right behind him in the Apartment she then shouts ""WHAT THE F..."" with the rest of the curse being cut off by the end credits.There are two after credit scenes one with The Vulture in prison and he runs into a man who will become the Scorpion and Vulture denies knowing Peter's identity even though he knows it.The final after credit scene has another Captain America PSA about patience and being disappointed for waiting so long so so little.

","In my review for Cars 3, I called 2017 ""the year of the franchise-fix"". Spider-Man: Homecoming is more proof. Not that Marvel's universe didn't need fixing, but the webbed-wonder definitely did, with 3 straight duds under Sony Pictures. Peter Parker's homecoming to the company that made him a household name was clearly the right decision, as we're finally given a movie our friendly-neighborhood hero always deserved. Thankfully, they've foregone the unbearably overplayed origin story (bit by spider, uncle dies, blah-blah-blah) and instead swing right into the true essence of Spider-Man. The cast is a web of hilarious teachers, relatable students, and a plethora of quirky non-supers learning to live in a post-Avengers world. But Holland is (obviously) the center. Surpassing both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, he's the confident, funny, wide eyed, smart and awkward hero we always wanted in the red-and-blue tights. Even at age 21, Holland plays the first Peter that's believably a teenager, and the movie refreshingly leans in to that adolescence. Struggles with schoolwork, childish crushes on girls, and even naiveté in his heroism all shine through beautifully. So yes, this is yet another positive review of an MCU film. Even if the normal issues are here (weak villain motivations, confusing timeline), it still stand among the 12(!) of 16 movies within that franchise that I unabashedly recommend. Nearly ten years since Iron Man kicked it off, it seems the further we go into this world, the deeper we explore what the implications of superheroes in the real world looks like. And as one of the premier superheroes of all-time, Spider-Man deserves that treatment, and finally gets it in this, his best film yet.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

Sadly, the emotional connection I needed, to make this a truly awesome version of Spidey never came (for me) Raimi's Spiderman 2 hit every note perfectly, and is still in my humble opinion the best Spidey movie out there.

A issue in most Marvel films is the villain and Vulture (Michael Keaton) is by no means a perfect villain but i think he still is one of the better we have seen in the MCU. It also helps that Vulture is played by such a great actor like Michael Keaton. The story in this film is great. It's a near perfect blend of a teen comedy like ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" and a superhero film.

The better the story lines the better the movie. Here, Peter Parker is kind of a cliché as a teenager. Still, he is fun and a bit dense. If I have an issue, it is his over confidence at times. For one with his gifts he can be quite naive. We have numerous moments when everything could explode but he manages to escape detection. I have to say that I'm growing tired of the physical confrontations, the violent fights. When two foes can't seem to harm each other no matter what they do, it actually gets a little dull.

Even the Spiderman's suit, that Tony Stark has made for him, is really impressive with all these high tech features and web combinations and Jennifer Connelly was really talented when she played the A.I. for it (Similar to F.R.I.D.A.Y in the Iron Man suit). Michael Keaton played a BAD-ASS Super-villain and that has scored a lot of points as well. As a huge Iron Man fan, I admired the support and motivation that Stark has given to Peter Parker as an Inspirational and Charismatic Mentor (Hoping that Robert Downey Jr. can win an Oscar for ""Best Supporting Actor"" in this movie). Overall I believe that Tom Holland has played a cool and hip Spider-Man similar to Ryan Reynold's Deadpool except with more comical but juvenile humor. I know that people say that he is too young to play the Spidey role but I think that we should give him a chance to continue to do so since he has produced promising results form this Hollywood Masterpiece. Who knows, he might even stun millions of viewers in the upcoming Avengers Movies. Good Job ;)",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

","In this Spiderman-movie we see Peter Parker as he struggles at school to impress the girl he likes and at the same time waits at a call from Iron-man to help to save the world. I personally do not like the mixture Iron man-the Avengers-Spiderman as I believe that the character of Spiderman is strong enough for a movie without Iron man or any other Marvel-character. The story is pretty stupid because a villain (Michael Keaton) is making and selling powerful weapons with alien-technology and nobody seems to care. Only Spidey and as he tracks down the source Iron-man tells him to back-off. Why? And neither the police, the FBI or the so-called Damage Control seems to be interested in catching the criminals who sells the alien-weapons. The special effects are great and that is the only positive thing to tell about this movie. It is a stupid and childish movie and not doing justice to the character of Spiderman.

He was an interesting, lovable Peter Parker and an absolutely classic Spider-Man. Michael Keaton was an exceptional vulture. You couldn't ask for a better actor to play him. This also had a lot of very comedic moments so if you enjoy comedies, this would be a good movie to see. This is how Spider-Man should always be. Lovable, funny, kind of awkward and witty and that's exactly what we get from this movie that we didn't fully get in The Amazing Spider-Man movies. I noticed some people were comparing to Spider-Man 2 and saying which one was better. I think they are both awesome but they are also very different in certain ways. Overall, this is a fun flick for the whole family to watch. Not much more you could have asked for.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017
223,17 July 2017,gigula,10," Another Spidey?
","Another try to show us the same angsty story about power and great responsibility? Wrong! Peter stuck in the middle of the teenage drama? Not quite! Spider-man as an Avenger? Well.... let me stop you there. My first impression when the trailer came out was, well I had a lot of doubts. For instance why there is no Uncle Ben, why Peter's best friend knows his best-guarded secret (that has been reviled in the comics only to help Iron Man's team during Civil War). Aunt May who is even less aware of everything? Iron Man in the background? No 'Friendly Neighbourhood Spider-man'? But then I went to see the movie and to say, I was pleasantly surprised. We got the whole need look at Peter Parker's life. First of all, we've never got to see Peter so young, though Andrew Garfield and Toby Maguire tried. He looks young and he is young. His life isn't exactly defined by his uncle's death. Sure it is implied but at the same time, it doesn't imply that this is why Peter became Spiderman. What we also got to see is Peter who learns how to be a hero. This kid really got one of the most solid moral core among the heroes. And now we can see how he learns how to do his job. It's no longer than 5 minutes of speeded process of embracing the powers, where in one moment he breaks the tap, can't control his 'sticky' powers and performs superhuman reflex and the next scene he has his suit made and his powers under control. No. And that's why it's good. It's funny, comical even, but true. Peter is true, he eats larb, builds lego Deathstar, studies for Spanish quiz, and saves the day. The other thing that surprised me was how well Tom and his real friend Jacob played the dynamic duo of Peter and his 'guy in the chair' Ned. It gives us a bit of fresh view, innocent even when it all is a game, an awesome adventure. And it also gives us A LOT of good humour. Then next we've got Aunt May, who is building a new life with Peter, starting over. She also has some kind of different innocence than we've seen before. She supports Peter and is just a bit more than an episodical character needed for the plot. Another character that has been rebooted is Flash Thompson, Peter's bully. Of course, he still is a bully, but the writers decided to expose the other side of him. For me, it gives a glimpse at the future where after all Peter and Flash became friends and Spider-man's ex- bully becomes a hero, Venom. Additionally, we had a chance to witness Happy's great return, yay!? And finally RJ, we are here. He did good, what did you expect. But he didn't steal the show, oh no. it was A Spider-man movie from the very end. Another pro of the movie is that there is no romance-centric plot. It's not always about getting a girl people! Moving on, that scene! You know which one! You didn't see that coming? Because I didn't. Simple yet great plot twist. But enough about the plot. Then again, the marvellous Marvel logo that constantly gets better and SPIDER-MAN THEME! That's right! The music was good, even though I was hoping to get another catch and a great soundtrack like we had in GoTG and GoTG vol2. Another thing that got me surprised was the camera. We've been served with a whole lot of scenes from new, and different angles. We got lots of different perspectives. General, big, from point of view and the best of all Peter's vlog from Germany. Last but not least brilliance of the credits. It really makes you want to sit there and wait for the credits to end, not like we wouldn't do this anyway. ;) I heard someone saying that they were disappointed with Peter. He was making a fool of himself. He was constantly saying: ""I'm sorry but I gotta go"" and couldn't get the job done right from the take one. But isn't it just how his life goes? because from what I know it is. Peter is one of the most relatable and at the same time tragic (ok, maybe not that tragic) comic characters. Because of he always, always does what is right. No matter what. he sacrifices his personal life, his love his happiness to make the world a better place. This is the reboot. This is the beginning. This is young Peter learning to be a hero. Him learning about power and responsibility. Learning to stay closer to the ground. And even though teenage Peter being pulled into high schools drama does sound cliché it paradoxically isn't. It's good. It's funny and it's just simply Peter Parker's life.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

276,8 June 2019,CabbageCustard,8," Not perfect, but still a lot of fun.
","I have to hand it to people who make superhero movies. They face considerable challenges, not the least of which is the streak of 'sameness' at the heart of many superhero story lines. You know how it goes: 1. We meet the superhero before they are a hero and see how they became a superhero 2. We meet the super villain and see why they became a villain 3. The superhero meets the public and all is good 4. The superhero meets the villain and now it's not so good 5. The superhero suffers some defeat or disgrace and accompanying confidence crisis and the public aren't so enamoured any more. 6. The superhero gets his/her act together and defeats the villain after all.
To be sure, some superhero movies break this pattern, but most follow it in some way or another. The trick is to follow the pattern in a way that is new, fresh and worth people spending their money to see. Spider-Man Homecoming manages to do that by making Peter Parker/Spiderman a fresh faced 15 year old being mentored by an older, avuncular Tony Stark. Of course, Spiderman isn't played by a 15-year old. Tom Holland is about 6 years older than that. It would have made more sense to say Spiderman was 18-years old, but oh well.... He is good in the role though and I look forward to seeing him in the sequel(s). Michael Keaton makes a pretty good villain too. He is intelligent and menacing.

","After the relative disappointment of the Amazing Spider-Man films, Spider-Man Homecoming is a welcome breath of fresh air. It's well acted and directed, with the best version of Spider-Man to date, although it does feel like something's missing. The tone is one of the things I particularly admired in this film; I could really relax, and have a good time. The high school element element was also invigorating, and felt like a good move on the studio's part as well. The script and story are adequate, and the humour charming if leaned on a little too heavily. But the cast, well directed by John Watts is what really impressed me in Homecoming. Tom Holland is the Perfect Peter Parker, and is genuinely hilarious and lovable throughout the film. The Vulture is a great villain, with Michael Keaton making you uneasy with every word that came out of his mouth. Jacob Batalon is sparky as Ned, and RDJ is once again on fine form as Tony Stark, albeit in a smaller role in the film. A criticism I would make is that the relationship between Peter and his love interest Liz (portrayed by Laura Harrier) feels extremely strained. Something that did trouble me walking out of the cinema was that whilst the film was great, it did feel like it was missing something; perhaps it was darker elements, or even emotional scenes. Overall however, Homecoming is a success, and undoubtedly a welcome addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and an installment that will please Spider-Man fans without question.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

","I'm a little disappointed in this film. I'm not happy the direction the Avengers franchise decided to take - outside its norm of blockbuster films, by changing the screenplay to be geared towards tweens. That's younger than a teenager. We all know they can be more annoying than teenagers sometimes, and this was the case with Tom Holland playing Peter/Spidey. He was just plain and annoying. I'm not sure if it was casting him for the role, are just a bad screenplay. All I have embedded in my brain is his annoying whiny yelling when the action started, every single time. I thought to myself, ""what a lousy superhero this kid would make.. no, wait.. he IS the superhero."" I just couldn't get past it. But I guess it's an untapped marked of new moviegoers that can go see it with their mom and dads and enjoy it. So in the franchises defense, it was a marketing move.

","I love the direction they took the new Spider-Man movie. Marvel has been hitting the right notes with making these movies that can please most comic book fans and general audiences. In this chapter, you get to see Tom Holland play a high school version of Peter Parker in his early days of trying to manage work and play. I wasn't fond of the idea when Marvel released the synopsis at first but I thought the movie went beyond my expectations. I didn't expect that many twists throughout the film and you'll be surprised at some of them if not all of them. They definitely answer a lot of questions on who the characters really are and they pay homage to Millar's ""Civil War"" series and we get to see some familiar faces we haven't seen in awhile once again. There's so much to say but it would spoil the movie! I think Holland did a terrific job playing a young Spidey with plenty of ""grit"" trying to find his right footing as a superhero. Therefore, as any young person would, you witness Peter not making the most rational decisions because he's only 15 years old trying to save New York City! I'm glad they didn't go with the origins route with ""great power comes great responsibility"" format that was done twice already. Although, it is very important for Peter throughout the comics, I'm hoping they touch upon Uncle Ben and this in the next film. Holland does a great job at playing the smart yet socially awkward high school kid. There were certain revealing moments in the movie where you see Tom really show the tension in his face. Also, I really liked the realistic portrayal of a diverse high school that's focused on nerds! I love it! The action was great but you don't see as many cool moves like in the previous Spidey movies. But I get it, he's still working with his ""training wheels"". I loved the supporting cast and you get to see some more Happy Hogan in this film and adore Marissa Tomei as a younger Aunt May....so attractive! But it was such an interesting take to see Michael Keaton play the villain and he really brings the character to life and you ""understand"" where he's coming from. Although, some may argue that Holland isn't the best Spider-Man or Homecoming isn't the best Spider-Man movie, there's something for everyone in the film whither it's the light humor, action scenes, more Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man or to continue the next chapter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, you'll enjoy the movie and I would definitely watch it again in theaters.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

","I think at this point, everyone is sick of the spider-man story. We all know that Uncle Ben dies, and Spider-Man makes his suit, but this is something we needed. We needed a new story with this character. I think portraying him as a little younger than usual works for his character. I love this movie, because Tom Holland's version of spider-man is very relatable. It can be easy to look at the MCU as just a giant super hero universe far from ours, but in this movie we see a high school kid in New York go on a field trip. We see him walking through the halls of school, and we see how the kids, and regular people react to the existence of superheros in this world.
This main reason is what gets me going back to the movie. There aren't too many MCU movies that portray this feeling. However I think some of this movie doesn't work as well as it should. Spider-Man is given a really powerful suit that just feels like a spider version of Iron Man. Sure that works in differentiating it, but you don't get the struggle of him making the suit, which can build character, and give great emotions when he uses the suit in battle.
All of the characters feel developed pretty well. Even some of the Decathlon team seemed pretty involved, which is great. However Aunt May didn't have as big a role in this movie, but hopefully now that she knows Peter is spider-man, she will be more prominent in Far From Home.
Overall a really fun movie, and one of my favorite MCU movies surprisingly!",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

357,26 April 2018,jcruz-42957,8," Spider-man: Homecoming: 8.0
","Spider-Man: Homecoming is the best Spider-Man movie since 2004. It nails the characterization of Peter Parker and adds a fun John Hughes feel around him. It's a very refreshing experience to finally see Peter Parker as an actual high school student who looks like he's in high school, and not a 28 year old Andrew Garfield. Tom Holland does an amazing job embodying Peter Parker and Spider-Man. Where Tobey Maguire has the best Peter Parker and Andrew Garfield has the best Spider-Man, Tom Holland successfully balances both sides of the character. The opening 30 minutes are fun and exciting, you get to see a montage of Peter just being a friendly neighborhood Spider-man that is hilarious, and shows a really likable character in Peter. This film shows how naive Peter really is. He has tremendous power, but he hasn't honed control over that power. That inherently forms a very well executed Mentor and Student relationship with Tony Stark. Tony Stark is used great in the film by not being too there too little and not being there too much. He's kept a good distance away from Peter so that he's not hovering over him the entire movie. Happy also serves as a hilarious side character to Peter, especially in the beginning. The tone perfectly nails Peter in high school, while the tone is amusing there is still moment of serious consequence for Peter, and he has to answer to Tony for some of them. Although the feel of the high school is spot on the only aspect that didn't as well as it needed to was the love interest. It never seemed to fully click between Peter and Liz. Micheal Keaton as Vulture was a good but not great villain. Some of his motivations seem slightly contradictory, but he's a good character with an interesting connection to Peter, and the Vulture Suit is a heavy slashing piece of sharp metal that look dangerous as hell. The films biggest fault was the overuse of CGI for Spidey's suit. It's a great suit but the film heavily relies on the CGI for moments that don't need it, and it takes you out of the movie as a result. Overall, Spider-Man: Homecoming has a fun atmosphere around it with a good characters surrounding Peter Parker. So I give it an 8.0",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

","A great, fun movie. Exciting to see Spiderman incorporated with the MCU and the Avengers. I agree with the '10' reviews... and also most of the '1' reviews. As a youth in the 90s I grew up with the Animated Series that became so popular. I am also a fan of the original comic from decades ago. Yes, I agree that this telling deviated much from some of the classic attributes to those early fans loved and criticized in this movie. Some of the changes made me cringe but just for a second. Most were well integrated. This was a great ""retelling"". Times have changed from the 50s, 60s, and even the 90s. I.e., Parker uses his smartphone instead of his flash camera from the original. The characters are more diverse - what's wrong with that (not just for PC reasons, but this takes place in NYC, right?). Stark is more involved in Parker's life. Etc. This movie tied in several elements from across years and versions of Spiderman's canon. I'm glad this wasn't another origin story. We still see a young upcoming hero, struggling with his powers, but also get to see the Stark involvement even though it happens later in the comics it brings Parker into the established time-line of the Avengers universe. Parker proves himself independently but still has a relationship with Stark. Aunt May's a bit younger but it works fine. His uncle is unmentioned but this more about Parker's relationship with Stark and Avengers world than his own personal backstory (we can still enjoy the old movies for all that). The villain, Vulture, was fantastic. Keaton was great. His story as a salvager of the all the alien wreckage from the Avengers' battles ties in nicely (again, this is part of the MCU). Anyway, I almost wanted him to win. He looked cool and still vulturish. I do feel Stark was a little too controlling but that's the character and Parker learns how to stand up to him. I only reason I took a point from 10 is the seeming lack of spider- sense. And MJ not a redhead. Some character updates withstanding, her red-hair is part of her. The Captain America cameos were a nice touch. And Hannibal Buress.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

","Review:
Although this movie made a massive profit, I really didn't enjoy it, mainly because it seemed like it was made for kids. The storyline also wasn't that great, and the whole ""college student"" element got on my nerves after a while. After watching the introduction of the new Spiderman in Captain America: Civil War, I was quite excited about this movie but it turned out to be a big let down. Anyway, Tom Holland takes the lead from Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker, and he's out to impress Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) so he can become an Avenger. With Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) keeping a close eye on him, he goes through school hoping to get the call to be involved in a mission but he ends up taking on a mission of his own, to try and prove that he has the ability to become an Avenger. Whilst serving the public in minor missions, he finally comes across a bunch of bank robbers, who use some fancy weapons which have never been seen before. When he tries to warn Tony Stark, he brushes him off, so he is forced to find out were these weapons come from, with the help of his close friend Ned (Jacob Batalon). When he finds out the root of the source, he tries to use all of his super human powers to take him down but he's pushed to the limit, which makes him question if he is ready to join the Avengers. Its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other Marvel movies but the director wasted to much time on silly scenes which eventually become irrelevant. Michael Keaton really did save the day in this movie, along with Downey Jr. and Favreau but the main character became irritating and quite annoying. The suit looked impressive and some of the action scenes were half decent but they were not in the same league as the action scenes in Spiderman 2, when he is fighting against Doc Ock. I don't really have high expectations for the next movie in this franchise but I'm hoping that he will make an appearance in Avengers: Infinity War which is due to be released next year with the cast of the Guardians of the Galaxy, and Dr. Strange.

Tony Stark is in the movie in exactly the right dose to keep the focus on Parker.

","First of all, let me get this out of the way: no. It is in no way, shape or form better than the Raimi films. However, it is not really fair to compare it to those films since this is completely different. Homecoming decides to wisely skip the origin story and give us more of a coming of age or high school flick, which is was very refreshing since one of my biggest fears was that it was going to rehash the Raimi films like the first Mark Webb film. Tom Holland is amazing as Spider-Man, as he perfectly captures how difficult it is to be both an average high school student as a superhero at the same time. Michael Keaton is fantastic as always as the Vulture, as he is very repeatable in a way that makes his different than the usual mediocre MCU villains.In fact, a lot of the supporting cast were really good in their roles. However, some big problems is that there are parts of the film where I feel like Marvel was playing it safe, as their are no real risks to action scenes. And while I was OK with most of the changes to the Spider-Man lore, there were some that felt forced or there just for the sake of change. Overall, I felt like this was a very solid start for Spider-Man in the MCU franchise. I feel that in the sequel they could expand upon the strengths of this film and make a great movie. Overall, this is a pretty solid summer popcorn blockbuster. It's no Logan or Civil War, but for a Spider-Man movie, it is just what I wanted.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

","Following his unofficial ""tryouts"" in Germany, Peter Parker returns to his home in Queens trying, albeit not very well, to balance his responsibilities as a high school overachiever with the added dangers of being a crime-fighting superhero. When a new and well-equipped criminal enterprise emerges in New York City, Peter naturally wants to try and end the threat, but quickly gets in over his head--much to the chagrin of reluctant mentor Tony Stark. Despite being the sixth go-round, this is a surprisingly refreshing take on the titular character, wisely sidestepping the origin tale formula, and presenting a unique story with a lighthearted tone, coming-of-age themes, and just enough twists and references to weave it within the greater framework of the burgeoning MCU. Holland is wonderful, bringing a youthful ambition and naiveté that hasn't been seen in previous incarnations of the character, while veteran Keaton is a chilling antagonist. Some of the supporting characters are underused, but this is a nice job overall. ***",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

","As a movie I would give it an 8/10 but for me personally it's a 9/10. Tom Holland is the best version of Spider-Man/Peter Parker yet. They really do a good job of showing us a Spider- Man that is inexperienced and still learning his new powers but is also very likable and relatable. He's quippy when he needs to be but he also acts like a 15 year old would actually act and makes mistakes sometimes. In the other movies they would usually just show a montage of him learning his powers and he would know things but in this one we are learning with him. As much as I love the older movies I never felt that they were quite able to capture Spiderman correctly. But this movie did. The reason Spiderman is likable is because he is us. He's not a rich Iron Man or a god. Just a regular kid who got superpowers. I felt like this movie really captured that and I can't wait for more movie were we get to see him grow. there were moments were I was really concerned for his safety. That being said there were some changes that this movie made that I liked but I could see others not liking it. One of them being the new suit. I liked it because it seems like something he would get from Iron Man and like I said, Peter is still learning his powers. And I liked That he talked to Karen and gets to unlock new things. Also he can do things without the suit but it's like a bonus. It is different though so I could see why some might not like it I liked that the school is diverse and that's actually what a school would look like. I also didn't mind that Flash was more of an asshole rich kid and not someone who punches Peter or whatever. Usually those are more stereotypical movie bullies I also liked the vulture. He was a menacing villain but at the same time you could see where he's coming from and why he's doing what he does. He's actually similar to Peter in some ways and I really liked that. He wasn't a bland boring villain The only things I didn't like in this movie was I thought that when Peter was stuck in the rumbles he hears Tony's voice AND sees his reflection with the mask. It was a little overdone I could have done without the voice. Also some of the CGI could have used a little more work. My favorite scene was when Spiderman gets defeated by vulture and he is stuck in the rumbles. He cries for help but there is no one there to help him. I felt bad for him and it made me realize that he's only like 15 but has to help himself because there is no one there. It was kinda heartbreaking. Even though that Tony line afterwards was cheesy.

443,7 July 2017,Troy_Campbell,8," Breezy fun with spectacular set pieces.
","With this iteration of the web-slinger arriving hot on the heels of the Andrew Garfield Amazing Spider-Man movies, it needed to justify its existence by bringing something fresh to the table. It does. As soon as Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is introduced through a series of his own video blogs, taking us behind the scenes during a key battle in Captain America: Civil War, it's clear this will be the funniest and most playful cinematic version of Spidey yet. Chockfull of irreverent humour, borderline adult gags and Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) injects, but also enough angst befitting a 15-year-old protagonist, director Jon Watts keeps the tone lightweight but edgy. Soon-to-be-megastar Holland is crucial to this tone, nailing the balance between ignorant enthusiasm, geeky charm and—coming with the adolescent territory—world-on-his-shoulders seriousness. When this Spider-Man makes mistakes you can't help but like him even more. And when his lapses in judgment lead to epic action set pieces, who can complain? The most memorable is a vertigo-inducing thriller set in, around and atop the Washington Monument; with both this and the gigantic ferry sequence showcasing Watts' talent for crafting big budget awe – expect to see him around a lot more in Hollywood. Of course this new Spidey requires its own take on all the usual elements, so we get a much younger and hipper Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), a more awkward and complicated romance (with Laura Harrier's Liza Allan), and a Stark-built suit with an amusing female-voiced interface. For the most part the new and/or improved ingredients work well (Jacob Batalon and Zendaya also make for a sweetly goofy best friend and a hilariously snarky loner respectively), however, Homecoming is not perfect. Michael Keaton's villainous Vulture isn't as threatening as he could've been, Tony Revolori's Flash Thompson is boring and clichéd, and there are sporadic bouts of distractingly shimmery CGI, particularly with shots that are entirely computer generated. By and large though this latest addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a breezy delight with spectacular set pieces and winning humour. If there was any doubt before it has now been expelled: Spidey is in safe hands at Marvel.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

Let me explain: Out of all of Spidey's movies, Homecoming captures the spirit and the essence of the character the best. I don't think any of the other films so perfectly embody the Spider-Man I know from the comics. However, I do think Spider-Man 2 is ultimately a better film. So while Homecoming is the best Spider-Man movie to date, it is not the best movie Spider-Man has been in. Raimi's Spider-Man films excellently captured the tragedy of Peter Parker, and I commend them for it. But this film captured his youthfulness. One of the defining elements of his character is that he's just a teenager, and while previous films have tried to capture that, they've ultimately fallen short. Here, Peter is just a kid, and you believe it.

","Its a good film. Not very original as I felt I was watching a new version of ""Kick-Ass"" but it had some really great aspects. The action scenes were wonderfully put in scene. The story approach is indeed like John Hughes would have shot a super hero film which worked perfectly for me in regards of a ""Spider-Man"" film because this was something I missed about all the previous films - the coming of age factor. Tom Holland was perfectly cast. There is no doubt. He IS Peter Parker and he IS Spider-Man with the right among of youth naivety. Great performance and absolutely convincing. Also the choice of Michael Keaton as Vutlure was not only a pitch perfect ironic casting choice but also the absolute right one because he took that role really seriously and delivered a wonderful performance. Really menacing in many aspects and it was role you could have easily overacted. The weakest point of the cast for me was Laura Harrier who wasn't particularly bad but just very boring. Marisa Tomei was a bit wasted and it was a positive surprise that they really kept Robert Downey Jr's appearance short - don't get me wrong I love him and his Tony Stark but he left to spotlight to Holland and Spider-Man which was the right thing after ""Captain America: Civil War"" felt more like an Iron Man film than a ""Captain America"" film. Why Gwyneth Paltrow tho received such a high billing for her cameo will ever be a huge mystery to me, same goes to Zendaya who had more like a side kick part, but at least she was fun.

It plows a field of it's own by using a coming of age story where Peter is desperately wanting to elevate his game and learning he's rushing in without tempering his burgeoning abilities thus getting in over his head. Call it a superhero's school of hard knocks Add high school puberty and young love in the mix and you have a unique slant that makes Peter as human as he is super. Stark and Peter's assigned watchdog (Happy played by Jon Favreau) ) stay largely in the shadows as it's all Peter which works wonderfully. Special mention goes to the outlaw alien weapons dealer played by Michael Keaton whose smarmy mannerisms make a perfect enemy in that you like his screen time while you hope Peter brings him down. Early on I feared it might be too much of a teen movie but I was wrong as it just built Peter's young man blues to a critical mass.

","As a lifelong Spider-Man fan and comic reader, I found the previous five film incarnations of the Wall Crawler to be a mixture of pluses and minuses, some heavier on the latter than other (talking about you Spider Man 3), but I am happy to say that the latest reboot of my favorite comic super hero, SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING, definitely has way more positives to its credit than just about any of the earlier films. It captures the sense of fun present in the Saturday morning cartoon versions. What makes HOMECOMING better than the rest: First of all, the script, which does not feel like a cut and paste job like some other comic book adaptations, the X-Men franchise being among the worst offenders. The writers follow up on the premise of CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR, where we first saw this teen age version of Peter Parker. HOMECOMING digs deep and finds what made those early Lee-Ditko collaborations so great: the nerdy high school science geek who is becomes a dynamic hero when he puts on the iconic suit and hits the streets of NYC to battle crime. Of course, we know it is not the costume that makes Peter Parker a hero, but what is inside his heart that really counts and this point very clear. Also gone is the angst and grimness of the Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield portrayals: this Spider-Man is having a blast being a super hero; there is plenty of power and responsibility, but there is plenty of fun as well. Peter's determination to win the approval of Tony Stark and become a full fledged member of The Avengers, can be taken as a orphan young man's search for a worthy father. It's a nice touch, and thank God we don't have to watch Uncle Ben take a bullet one more damn time, in fact he's not even mentioned.

","I was without any hype for Spider-Man: Homecoming, the trailer did not excite me and it looked like Iron Man would have been more prominent than necessary, and I was rather disappointed with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2, but Spider-Man: Homecoming surprised me, what a good and fun movie, first that the Iron Man has a very small participation which is great, the film has a humor without exaggeration, the characters do well the role, the cast is great, Tom Holland is without doubt the Spider-Man is the most complete film, he is as good as Peter Parker and as Spider-Man, I still think Spider-Man 1 by Sam Raimi is the best Hero movie, but as an actor I prefer Tom Holland, Jacob Batalon plays the role he is not a villain with ambitious plans of how to conquer the world and this is good, because he is not a villain with ambitious plans of conquering the world and that is good because he is a villain the height of a Spider- Robert Downey Jr is well when he appears, Laura Harrier does his role well too, and Marisa Tomei is well, now Zendaya makes a very weak character, but I do not blame the actress, and Tony Revolori who does the Flash Thompson leaves a lot to be desired, because he does not look intimidating in the movie, but the actor himself does the role well, Jon Watts makes a sure direction in a matter of tone, he does not change, but I think it was not necessary to do it now, leave it to Thor: Ragnarok, because that yes must be different, the movie has a good soundtrack and good special effects, Spider-Man: Homecoming is funny, it is not the best of this marvel universe in the movies and much less is the best Spider- Man movie, but I recommend it, and it shows that Marvel got the ideal Spider-Man.

","Oh, and to also make a damn decent iteration of Spiderman for the big screen. Was never a fan of the Raimi trilogy, Tobey Maguire didn't work for me. Andrew Garfield was great but the films ultimately didn't deliver. Now that Marvel acquired him, we finally have a great iteration. Not perfect, but pretty damn great. Smart moves were made that I do applaud. Not rehashing the origin story for a third time was THE move that was important. This is post Civil War, and the studio knew how intelligent their audiences were...obviously being the fact we didn't want to see another 30 minutes of Peter getting bitten and discovering his abilities in bewilderment. Second smart move was to use Tony Stark as the father figure as opposed to Uncle Ben (again!), thankfully Iron Man was kept to a minimum but the endearment and protection that Stark has for Parker was a much needed attribute to the plot in order to keep it grounded. That is exactly what this film does best, it remains low-key even in terms of our villain's motives (which I must say were rather bland). Final smart move, obtaining the perfect cast. Oh yes this cast was so tidy! Tom Holland, in a career defining role, aced it. Finally we have a younger Spiderman and his portrayal was the most accurate representation of the comic book superhero so far. Michael Keaton looks like he was enjoying his role as the psychopath Vulture, although for the film to describe him as a psychopath is hyperbolic. More bitter perhaps? The rest of the cast were charismatic and were able to execute their lines to comedic perfection. The script is rather witty which definitely enhances the comic book feel that the film was going for. It's part superhero blockbuster and a coming-of-age comedy and switches between the two frequently, my problem is they didn't mix well and it felt like watching two separate films. I was more interested in Peter Parker's school life than his super heroic antics. Still, a consistently good entry for the MCU!",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

Now, I found that the story-line of Spiderman: Homecoming was quite impressive, starting by being original, finally the story of spider-man is joined with The Avengers. In addition to that, Peter Parker has a love interest that never appeared before, as well as his best friend. Apart from the story-line, I found that the emerging villain of the movie was good, and the story behind him was well told, but they should have dedicated more time to explain his arising. And finally the most important detail of the movie, thanks to the work of Tony Stark of course, Spiderman is now a modern superhero, with all kind of ""web weapons"", for example a web grenade, or an instant kill combat mode. Without mentioning the music from the motion picture, at the beginning of the movie we can listen to the original theme from the comics of spider-man, that was a great idea Summarizing, this new spider-man movie is very original and I believe it is the best of all times, because it offers us the most realistic spider-man of all, and because of the great movie of course, according to the details given on this text.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

","Tobey Maguire came first and pulled it off, Andrew Garfield came second and sort of took it backwards, then finally the web-slinging hero made his debut alongside the other Avengers in Captain America: Civil War, so of course he would get his new solo movie soon after, expectations were high. Basically following the Battle of New York, Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) and his salvage company are contracted to clean up the city, but the Department of Damage Control (D.O.D.C.), owned by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), takes over the operation. Before being stopped, Toomes and his team scavenged Chitauri technology, enraged being out of business, Toomes persuades his employees the keep and use these to create and sell advanced weaponry. Eight years later, Stark drafts Peter Parker aka Spider-Man (The Impossible's Tom Holland) into the Avengers to help with an internal dispute, but following the airport fight, Stark does not feel Parker is ready to become a full Avenger, so Parker resumes his studies at the Midtown School of Science and Technology. Parker quits his school's academic decathlon team to spend more time focusing on his crime-fighting activities as Spider-Man. One night, Parker prevents criminals robbing an ATM, using their advanced weaponry, after which he returns to his Queens apartment, where his best friend Ned (Jacob Batalon) discovers his secret identity. On another night, Parker nearly drowns intervening in a business deal, where Toomes' associates Jackson Brice aka Shocker (Logan Marshall- Green) and Herman Schultz (Bokeem Woodbine) are selling weapons to local criminal Aaron Davis (Donald Glover), Stark as Iron Man rescues him, he has been monitoring him with the Spider-Man suit he gave him, Stark warns Parker getting involved with dangerous criminals. Toomes accidentally kills Brice with one of the advanced weapons, Schultz becomes the new Shocker, Brice left behind a weapon, Parker and Ned study it and remove its power core, Parker rejoins the decathlon team as they travel to Washington, D.C., with the real agenda to follow a tracking device on Schultz, leading to Maryland. Ned and Parker disable the tracker Stark implanted in the Spider-Man suit, while Parker unlocks its advanced features, with the help of A.I. voice Karen (Jennifer Connelly). Parker tries to stop Toomes, as the Vulture, in a technologically advanced mechanical flying suit, from stealing weapons from a D.O.D.C. truck, but Parker is overpowered and trapped inside the truck, causing him to miss the decathlon national tournament. Parker races to races to the Washington Monument when he discovers the power core is an unstable Chitauri grenade, it explodes and traps Ned and their friends in an elevator, Spider-Man evades the authorities and saves his friends, including his fellow classmate and crush Liz (Laura Harrier). Returning to New York City, Spider-Man confronts Davis, who reveals Toomes' whereabouts, Parker is able to capture Toomes' new buyer Mac Gargan (Michael Mando) aboard the Staten Island Ferry, but Toomes escapes and a malfunctioning weapon tears the ferry in half, the passengers are saved with the help of Iron Man, but Stark is angered by Parker's recklessness and takes away the Spider- Man suit. Parker returns to his high school life, and eventually asks Liz to the homecoming dance, on the night of the dance he is shocked to discover Liz's father is Toomes, he in turn deduces Parker's secret identity, he threatens retaliation is he interferes with his plans. During the dance, the Avengers Tower is being emptied ready to move to the new headquarters, Parker realises Toomes plans to hijack a D.O.D.C. plane transporting weapons from the tower. Parker dons his old homemade Spider-Man suit, he is ambushed by Schultz at Toomes' lair, he defeats him with the help of Ned, Toomes then destroys the building's support beams and leaves Parker to die. Parker escapes the rubble, intercepts the D.O.D.C. plane, causing it to crash near Coney Island, Parker and Toomes fight, it ends with Parker saving Toomes from his own unstable equipment, he is left for the police, along with the plane's cargo. In the end Liz moves away after her father is arrested, Parker is invited by Stark to join the Avengers full time, he declines, but Stark returns his Spider-Man suit, Peter's Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) walks in just as he is putting his suit on., while in prison Toomes purposely denies to Gargan that he knows Spider-Man's real identity. Also starring Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan, Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, Zendaya as Michelle, Tony Revolori as Flash, Tyne Daly as Anne Marie Hoag, Kenneth Choi as Principal Morita, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America and Stan Lee as Gary. British actor Holland proves the perfect choice to play the spirited and wise-cracking hero, Keaton does well as the villain, Downey Jr. is good supporting the lead hero, and there is good support from Tomei and Favreau, I think Zendaya deserves the biggest mention, brilliant comic relief as the hilariously snidey classmate. The story is clever, connecting the Avengers movies seen previously, there is no need to go into a Spider-Man origins story, it just gets straight to point, where the hero is trying to prove himself and save people whenever possible, and the special effects combined with exciting set pieces are fantastic, a most impressive superhero fantasy action adventure.

Homecoming is given a complete reboot. It doesn't focus on peter's origins and uncle ben stuff. Peter is a high school kid. Aunt may is a hot spinster and tony stark is his his mentor. After the airport battle in civil war, peter is waiting for tony stark's call on next mission. But tony instructs him to be only a friendly neighborhood spiderman. Adrian toomes known as the vulture is planning to steal essential weapons of stark tech. How peter stops him and impress stark is the rest of the film.
Tom holland fits perfectly as peter and spidey. In comics, peter was a high school kid and holland looks exactly like a teenager. His friendship with jacob battalon was a treat to watch. Michael keaton was impressive as vulture and his scene of threatening peter was worth mentioning. The typical humor in mcu films is abundant. Robert downey jr as usual was a treat in his extended cameo of tony stark. But we got to see less of action in him. The scene where peter tries to lift the wall rock gives goosebumps.
But i have three issues with the movie. First is peter's intentions. In original spiderman, peter's motive was with great power comes great responsibility. Whereas in homecoming, peter does stuff only to impress tony stark and join avengers. Second the film lacks emotions. Mcu films have comedy but also enough emotions too. Third is the unexciting action sequences which were mostly childish. Amazing spiderman series had much cool action scenes.
For 90s and early 2000s kids spiderman will be tobey maguire but for 2010s kids spiderman will be tom holland. In that case homecoming succeeds. But can't digest him being too dependent on stark.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

","First Of All , i had seen Spider-Man Homecoming movie for the first time in Randolph Theatre in Massachusetts this past Friday 07.07.2017. My name is Piotr Kucharski and i am from Europe Poland. I got into comic books at age of 10 years old and what got me into them besides growing up poor was Marvel's The Amazing Spider-Man and that is when i fell in love with the comic books in first place. I am 32 now and up to this day out of all super heroes and comic books that i am still collecting The Amazing Spider-Man and everything related to him is all my life time favorite comic book hero. Now i've had seen all past spider-man movies up to homecoming and i have to admit personally that this one with Tom Holland is as best and close authentic as it can get so far to Marvel's The Amazing Spider-Man except the fact that Iron Man Tony Stark had given him the suit and was his mentor in this latest movie. There are a lot of things that i loved in this movie such as: Tom Holland surprisingly fit and portrayed Spider-Man almost close o perfect because of his personality and great humor either though Spider-Man is American and not from England he he. Tom Holland was funny/sarcastic when he needed and serious when needed also in the movie and displayed characteristics from comic books a lot. He also fit great besides his age as high school student and as peter Parker. Michael Keaton also played fantastic vulture and almost followed him closely as Marvel comic book portraits the character. Last but not least Tony Stark was a nice surprisingly addition to spider-man as his mentor and gave him nice suit either though in comic book Spider-Man had made mostly them himself. But as future goes and compared to real life, this movie suit helped him gave the spider sense acting as a female voice in his mask which i found perfectly amazing and close as it can get to his spider-sense other than kinda movie imaginary sense in other spider-man movies. Few other things were also fantastic but some were a bit disappointing such as why they did not show Holland starting fresh a bit and getting bit by spider and becoming a spider-man?? Well they wanted to follow of what happened after civil war. In conclusion Spider-Man score 8 out of 10.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

The writing helps accentuate this by playing up Parker's teenage duties, plights, and perspective. It also helps that this is a coming-of-age story instead of an origin story.

","This is the reboot we've been waiting for! This returns one of Marvel Comics most beloved heroes to his roots. Tom Holland delivers a young and energetic Spiderman that teens can admire and even like, while longtime MCU fans can enjoy the web crawlers interaction with other Marvel greats. The film returns Spidey to his high school beginnings, and without rehashing the origin story movie goers have seen over and again, follows his growth as a teen superhero in a larger MCU where the world is changing following the events of other Marvel movies. One of the films stronger points is that it doesn't go over board trying to get Peter Parker grown up in 2 hours, but rather allows him to grow and change naturally. Previous adaptations of the wall crawling hero have pushed through the characters youth into early adulthood, but this movie has as much fun with it as can be had. This is an exciting ride through a new spider-verse, where audiences can delight in watching the youthful Jr. Avenger grow up through the course of many adventures, of which this is the first! The dynamic relationship between Peter and mentor Tony Stark (Iron Man) is real and demonstrates the reliance of mentors to young people. The appearance, all-be-it via video screen, of Steve Rogers (Captain America) offering his insights to high school students added a humorous, but very real feeling look into the greater MCU, while keeping America's favorite web shooter at the center of the story.

The film is obviously a success and not another Amazing 2 mess, as the crappy trailers suggested, yet it's not much of a comic adaptation and more of a radical reinterpretation.

","The movie shows the effects of the Avengers New York attack and how the alien tech can get into the wrong hands. Vulture is a cool looking villain played by the great Michael Keaton and his character is kind of menacing and brutal to Peter in this movie. Peter is still learning how to be Spider-Man in this movie as he thinks he is ready to take on bigger threats this early into his Spider-Man years. Although he must learn for himself how to be his own Spider-Man and what makes him a hero, he is still faced with challenges and needs to learn from his mistakes. Peter tried to prove himself to Stark and himself that he is capable of more than he was set out to do but he is overwhelmed by it all in the process. Peter learns that by him being a hero/Spider-Man puts the people closest to him in danger so he must protect them. Peter also has to learn that the advanced Stark suit doesn't make him Spider-Man he learns that just being Peter Parker makes him Spider-Man. Love the montage of Peter having fun and getting ready for a date (a prom date) with the girl he wanted to get with and then the music just cuts and it's vulture. Vulture interrogating Peter in the car is one of the best scenes as it keeps you on the edge as he death stares Peter and talks in a low voice then just pulls a gun on him at the school is chilling. Peters homemade suit is one of my personal favourites as it looks so simple but so cool like you could just wear it out and about and shows he is becoming a hero of his own making at the end of the film. Love that he doesn't use Stark tech to track Vulture he just tracks his phone which is the Spider-Man I love who doesn't use all the fancy gadgets all the time and he also uses his good old fashioned web swinging and his strength instead of fancy tech too. Vultures wings explode even after Peters attempts to try save him after everything, he even runs through the flames unprotected and pulls him out. This and leaving his daughter out of it all has given him a kind of respect for Peter keeping his identity a secret from those who want to know. Whilst this Spider-Man movie isn't ""emotional or deep"" as the originals or Andrew movies it is emotional and deep in its own kind of way like an MCU way. Overall the film is fun to watch and a great edition to the MCU. The ending of the film Peter learns where he truly belongs, protecting his city and the people in it.

","Homecoming was definitely worth it, even if only as another chapter in the sprawling MCU epic. Homecoming skips Peter's origin entirely, which is fine because we maybe don't need to see it again. Instead the film opens in the fallout of the Battle of New York in Avengers, where a privately contracted clean-up crew are replaced by a government-sanctioned team. Embittered and feeling victimised, Adrian Toomes and his crew decide to keep some of the alien tech they salvaged and use it to create powerful weapons to sell on the black market. Not only did they put Spider-Man in the MCU, but they tied his first solo adventure directly into the tapestry of the MCU. It managed to develop a part of this universe we don't really get to see outside of the TV shows; the effect of all these superheroes on your everyday civilian. Peter and his friends literally grew up in a world of superheroes, which as an adult I'm finding hard to quantify (I was already out of school when the MCU even started).",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

","When I was a kid a used to read, and I still have those comic books, Spider-Man a lot.
Now I am a man, for some time now, and looking at a high school sophomore fight, for all intents and purposes, real harden criminals is just to far fetched for me, even if he was bitten by a spider. He has enhanced senses not enhanced heart. When your a kid this is a plausible idea, but as a man it is not.
Spiders can be killed also. When you have kids and women (and both weigh no more than 130 pounds, give or take) doing the exact same thing as, or against, people that are 250 pounds of better (in the case of villians) is just becomes a joke and insults our intelligence.
Moreover, it diminishes what their male counterparts (who are significantly larger, stronger, quicker and faster) are doing. Oh yeah, at the end spidey is walking with Stark and Downey is at least 4 or 5 inches taller and Downey is all of 5' 6"" maybe and a BIG MAYBE, 5 ' 7"". Maybe camera angle but really, even smaller spiders were crushed. But I digress.
The role of superhero is that of anyone nowadays, and from the looks of it ANYONE is taking over.
Watch the end of (very, very close to the end) of ""Bowfinger"" with Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy . They are karate guys but they are old and slow and have, well, problems physically, but they beat the crap out of hundreds of Ninjas. It looks funny, but you get the point.
At least the other ""superheroes"" are adult males. Again , there is no way a high school sophomore is doing what he did even if he was bitten by a spider, just not happening.
The movie has him, at the end, all of a sudden attached to the bad guy flying to the plane and on the plane, not in the plane, his spidey web works outside, again not happening.
If it wasn't for my kids i would never watch these movies.
Again, as an adult I have a really hard time watching a 14 or 15 kid become violent and tough and take down numerous super villians.
So if you do not have kids, be an adult and see an adult picture or watch one from the 1930s of 1940s with meaning and not let these people get ultra rich doing a mediocre job, which is all the height they can attain and this movie proves it.

","I give this film a 6 because it was pretty enjoyable in the moment. Tom Holland is excellent as Peter Parker/Spider-man, and it made for a good time at the movies. That being said, the creative decisions that were made to incorporate and integrate the webslinger into the Marvel Cinematic Universe really ruined Peter's backstory and really all that made Spider-man an underdog hero to root for. Tony Stark literally gives Peter everything he needs and then some. I missed the Peter Parker who sewed his suit himself and endlessly experimented (and often failed) to create his tech and hone his skills. This may seem like a small thing to gripe over, but I believe these things were essential to Spider-Man's character.

It was so fun to see Robert Downey Jr, but not nearly enough screen time. Liz is an easily believable heartthrob. She has athletic beauty and substance. What I did not like: two of the sidekicks were grossly obese. The actors talk so fast in teen slang I could only understand a small fraction of the dialogue. Most of the movie consists of unidentified out-of-focus objects being thrown at the 3D audience. That gets annoying very quickly. I kept checking my watch to see how much longer it would go on.

647,8 July 2017,Thekeybaldemasterrises,8," It has some studio problems but it ended up being a great Spidey movie!
","This movie is a solid entry into the MCU(or is it?). Tom Holland I thought couldn't get any better than he was in Civil War but he blows all expectations. He has to be the best portrayal of Spidey so far. He captured that innocence and comedic timing that perfectly sums up who Spider-Man is. His arc mirrors Tony Stark in a way of the whole ""does the suit make the man"", but it surprisingly still feels emotional enough and works for this movie. We've never seen the character exist in a larger world on film before and to see him grow as his own hero is a nice spin on the story. We don't have to go through the origin or Uncle Ben's prologue again but it rather takes time to focus on the most important aspect that both the Tobey Maguire and a Andrew Garfield films just gloss over. That he's a kid. He's way too young to be doing any of this but he does, and you see him struggle with that. In that sense it doesn't feel like a movie we've seen before . I just have to say too this movie is really funny. It utilizes the MCU connections well and gives a lot of fun opportunities for the writers. The story is a great start for the character, becoming apart of this larger world we know through the MCU, it's a throwback to the John Hughes genre of teen films and you totally believe that's what they were going for. Having Iron Man be his mentor in the background of the movie was a smart move and including Downey along with Faveru was fun as it should be. I was really excited to see Michael Keaton as Vulture and I was mostly satisfied. I liked the way his character was introduced and I do believe he's one of the more interesting Marvel villains so far but I almost wanted more time with him because of that. Hopefully it's not the last time we see him. This movie is solid overall and I absolutely think it's worth it for the third time rebooting him, you should definitely go see it. But wait. There are some problems I wanted to share. On a filmmaking level the biggest thing for me was pacing. The movie starts off so great, and then slows down a lot in the second half. There's a point where it feels like it halts and it doesn't really need too. On a casting level this is where the movie started to take hit points for me. The diversity in the cast is reallyyyyyyyy forced. The actor playing the friend is fine, and Zendaya is surprisingly funny, however the actress playing Liz and the actor playing Flash stuck out like a sore thumb. She was serviceable but not memorable which is not something you don't want out of your female love interest in a Spider-Man movie. And the actor playing Flash does a good job but he misses the point of the character and it just doesn't make any sense why they made him Guatemalan. It's very obvious they're trying to appeal to every market they can and it makes me question who was really making this movie? Sony or Marvel. My guess is Marvel was told to limit their participation on the movie but all the good stuff was on their part. However this is my BIGGEST issue with the movie and why I fear for the future of this franchise. It seems to step backwards to Sony's safety net. They shadow a lot of moments from the Rami films and I'm dying for someone to upload a comparison video because there's a lot of scenes that reminded me of the first two Rami films. And that post credits scene at the end just shows me that Sony clearly has their own agenda for the franchise and they don't want Marvel involved once this movie, or the next one makes them a billion dollars finally. Be careful Marvel fans, this movie is indeed good, but I'm still cautious about Sony because we all know what they can do. I just hope Tom Holland can keep up and not have to go through what Garfield did. Go support the movie but just know that once Sony gets their money they'll give Marvel the boot and start the Sinister 6 plan all over again. Guaranteed. And unfortunately I can't say I liked it more than Spider-Man 2, but it comes close really close.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

","This is the second movie to star Tom Holland as Spider-Man in this incarnation (after ""Captain America: Civil War""). Both the superhero and his high-school-student alter-ego (or is it the other way around? That's another thing I can be hazy on) Peter Parker, are presented at their most awkwardly adolescent. In the timeline of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe), ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" begins directly after Spider-Man's participation in a superhero gang fight in 2016's ""Civil War."" But the movie itself begins eight years prior to that, in the aftermath of Loki unleashing the Chitauri, which trashed much of NYC and the Avengers' sleek headquarters in 2012's ""The Avengers."" (That's a 2012 movie, and it's only 2017 now, but don't look at me, I'm just going by the on-screen texts.) In the wreck of the Avengers' HQ, Michael Keaton's hard-working salvage dude Adrian Toomes is showing a colleague a drawing of the Avengers scrawled by Toomes' own ten-year-old child. Those in the audience with a familiarity with possibly fake Chekhov quotes will recognize this as the gun on the mantelpiece in Act One that is obliged to go off in Act Three, and by Odin, off it does indeed go, but it's a long way from Act One to Act Three. Soon Toomes and his crew are kicked off the site by an officious Tyne Daly and it's revealed that Tony Stark is ostensibly self-dealing by heading a government clean-up crew to handle the superhero mess. To give credit to the six screenwriters on this movie, the oodles of rather convoluted plot detail are relatively clear even if you're not super-paying-attention. ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" sees Peter Parker being shunted aside by his adult mentors Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) to tackle the more down-to-earth challenges of high school on his own. ""Spider Man"" comic's most graphically exceptional scenes, from 1966's Issue 33, ""The Final Chapter!"" um, isn't as good as the comic book was, quite honestly.

Another aspect of the film that I felt was unnatural was the casting choices. In our PC world where a film can draw negative attention on the diversity of its cast (which we all know Sony has trouble with) I think what Sony has decided to do here (to avoid this) is to balance the top heavy white cast -the fact that the main lead hero main lead villain are white- they felt the need to flood the other roles with non white cast.

And, it's pretty great! It feels more like a cartoon so it really fits well with Spider-Man's character, Tom Holland as Peter Parker is incredible, and the movie is extremely funny. Tony Stark (Iron-Man) as Spidey's, sort of, mentor is great. I've always liked Robert Downey Jr as Iron-Man so him teaching SPIDER-MAN of all people is just, just...AMAZING! Peter Parker's friend, Ned, is the best comic relief character in any movie to date because he's ACTUALLY FUNNY.

I am writing this mostly to ask those who castigate the 'fanboys' for wanting more from a spiderman movie what is their objective. Ironically calling these genuine reviewers 'trolls' or 'butthurts' whilst not seeing what they are themselves??? So they don't have the same opinion as you, so what? For what it's worth I agree with the fanboys, being one myself. I won't dissect too much into the finer elements of race, tech suit etc., but I do believe this move to have lost the soul of what it means to be part of the MCU. All the other films presented us with something of a slight back-story to help us engage with the current universe. I appreciate it's a Spidey story done a million times, but come on this is Spidey, we want to see him being a nerdy little guy who gets superpowers, the girl, the person we wanted to be!!! That's why we loved him. Here he is portrayed as a weak little kid, given a super-suit and weird adolescent story arc. I reckon the suit could have waited until he proved himself for the Avenger cause and there's nothing wrong with casting Gwen Stacy or Mary Jane Watson without having to diversify. Equally the bizarre Flash. So a step back for MCU, here's hoping Thor and Hulk can give us the fizz back.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

Part of becoming a hero is skipped and it's a big plus, since we know it already and seen it thousands of times. The movie shows that expectations about being superhero may differ from reality and that makes Spider-Man a bit different from other superhero movies.
Since Spider-Man is a 'teen' in this movie, Tom Holland act like one and he does a great job. Making Spider-Man younger again didn't make movie childish. Of course it's not serious drama movie and you shouldn't expect it from Spider-Man, but the movie can entertain adults just as kids, just because it's not filled with too much fantasy and unbelievable stuff. Jokes fits perfectly and are not overwhelming. If you are looking for fun family movie - this one is probably the best pick from whole MCU movie collection.

It isn't a movie that will break dramatic new ground but it has the capability to make you smile and at the very least it is a different approach to the character of Peter Parker who desperately needed one. The key to the success here is that 'Spider-Man' has fun. It's funny and light and doesn't dissect the nature of heroism. I can't begin to tell you how much of a vast improvement on the Nolan-esqe Garfield films and the 9/11 residue on the Raimi films.

The supporting characters did well alongside Tom, and watching Zendaya's role was especially entertaining as she is not in the movie that much but delivers some of the better lines in the film.

Fun action, a fast, charming, witty and ultra-cool screenplay and all-around strong performances make this a very good time at the movies, and the decision to show Spidey's emotional turmoil and coming of age instead of his origins was a masterstroke.

Indeed, it is much more a mix of a silly high school film and a Iron Man film. This Spiderman has very little of Spiderman. First of all, instead of having extreme reflexes, he is quite clumsy, what is nonsense and made the film a bad slapstick comedy. Besides that, what the hell is that Iron Man-like suit with many powers not traditionally related to the spider? Therefore, the fact that this is not really a Spiderman film is bad enough not to consider it a good movie. Though, there are many other problems: most of the action scenes are confusing (like the scenes Transformers franchise bad recent films use to have), there is an excess of jokes with more than 90% of them being bad and silly, acting is unconvincing for most of the main roles (Michael Keaton is clearly an exception)...

","First two thirds was awful; last third was a bit more interesting and bearable. It seemed as if the whole movie pandered to kids of today. The movie started out with Peter's non-stop, shaky video recording of his trip to meet Tony Stark...really?? Throughout the first half of the movie, he just kept whining about not being assigned more missions or be taken seriously by Tony Stark. Peter Parker was never a whiny teen nor some starstruck adolescent who couldn't control his impulses. He was a brainy kid who created and improved upon his own spidey suits. He wouldn't be seduced by any hi-tech fancy gadgets provided by Stark. Although he made the right decision at the end of the movie, which IMHO was the movie's redemption, the earlier premise was a huge disappointment. And what was the point in objectifying Aunt May with all the sexist innuendos and dressing her in sexy clothes (no offense to Marisa Tomei who is beautiful in her own right)? Speaking of Aunt May, did anyone else notice that neither Peter nor his best friend Ned actually addressed her as ""Aunt May"" and just called her May? Is this what kids do these days, no show of respect to aunts or uncles? I couldn't imagine Peter ever calling Uncle Ben just ""Ben."" These seemingly small details spoke volumes as to the degradation of respect in this movie. Shame on the writers. While there were moments that elicited a few laughs, the movie overall lacked heart and soul. It was simply a testosterone ride through the CGI world of Tony Stark. Last but not least: stay for the final scene a couple minutes into the credits, then bail out...the very end scene was a cheap trick and a total waste of time. Tobey Maguire's Spiderman movies are still the ones to beat. Even Andrew Garfield's were better. Want a thrilling and inspiring movie?

And there were other problems with the early Spiderman, too much slow romantic entanglement and unentanglements, plus derivative plots. E.g., Spiderman III has some great fight scenes a lot of dreary moments and a plot derivative even from its own earlier movies. I didn't like the second Spiderman, skipped II on that. This Spiderman feels quite right, the movie gets extra juice having Tony Stark involved but that's somewhat of a mixed blessing, I might have liked to see a little less Stark in the plot. Michael Keaton has always been a favorite for me, the best movie Batman, and he plays a finely textured villain in this one.

I wasn't a fan the first time watching it, but this movie grew on me over time. From the excellent side characters from Peter's classmates like his best friend Ned and the new MJ by Zendeaya, the teachers are pretty enjoyable. But the best side character is the villain, the Vulture, and Tony Stark. The Vulture is all business. He isn't intimidating but portrays the most common villain, the ordinary person who wants to get CREAM (money), not for greed but as a necessity.

","After making his on screen debut as Peter Parker/Spider-Man in Captain America: Civil War, Tom Holland returns once again in his own feature film, that is still learning the ropes of being Spider-Man, while also being taken under Tony Stark/Iron Man's wing to be the next new Avenger. When weapons of mass destruction start making their ways to the streets of New York, Peter Parker must use his skills and learn the ropes of being a full time superhero as he goes as he battles his first big threat known as Vulture. So for starters, Tom Holland is hands down the MCU's Spider-Man bringing us the geeky and awkward side of Peter Parker to life just like the comics. The best part of this film is hands down Michael Keaton's Adrian Toomes/Vulture. He shows us in this film that he can be not just a convincing villain, but a great villain if that with a higher purpose who wasn't always bad and always try's to do the right thing for the people he loves. Marisa Tomei as May Parker I have to say is my favorite actress to ever portray the character. Zendaya as Michelle ""MJ"" Jones I thought at the time was a odd casting since they didn't get much screen time in this film, but was fitting for the role. Jacob Batalon is definitely the funniest character of the film and one of my favorite of all of Peter Parker's friends in a Spider-Man movie. Lastly, Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark/Iron Man is fantastic as always being the mentor for Spider-Man and teaching him what it means to be a hero. Overall, this is a fantastic film to kick off Spider-Man being in the MCU that makes you want more of him by the end. Rating 9/10.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

The Amazing Spider-Man was good for the Spider- Man origin story but this movie was great because of Tom Holland he is definitely the best Spider-Man I was glad when he made an appearance in Captain America Civil War I was excited because he finally would get to be in the Avengers but it was just one mission and was hyped to see more of him and was really satisfied I can't wait for the sequel give this a 9/10 highly recommend it this is better than The Amazing Spider-Man 1,2 and Raimi's Spider-Man Trilogy altogether although the origin story in The Amazing Spider-Man was great but this movie is better Andrew Garfield is not the best Spider-Man to me he's second best.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

He uses the deeds of those who are more rich and powerful than him as justification. That's it. No grand designs to take over the world, and no deliberate attempt at mass destruction (although that accompanies any decent comic book movie regardless). When teenager Peter Parker interferes with those plans, the only revenge plot is to keep Spider-man from interfering with his family business. Again, simple plans. It is the simplicity of the villain and the superhero that made this movie a breath of fresh air in comparison with its competitors.

869,7 July 2017,scott-sw,7," Spider-Man Swings Back to the Top
","Spider-Man Homecoming is appropriately named, finally bringing our favorite web-slinger home to fun, lighthearted fun. After the Raimi- Maguire era came to an ignoble stop, and after Garfield's gloomy, glum, grim take bottomed it out, Spidey is swinging strong. This is the best since the apex of Raimi's Spider-Man 2 over a decade ago. We begin immediately after the Avengers defeat of the Chitari in New York when Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) is scavenging through the alien technology. He was contracted to do so, but then ingloriously kicked to the curb by the government and Tony Stark/Ironman (Robert Downey, Jr.) He takes some for himself to research and use. Kick forward to near present day when Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tom Holland) helps the Stark Team against the Cap Team in Civil War. Then, we return to New York where Stark tells Spider-Man he will be an asset to the Avenger and to wait for his call. Spidey is now relegated to the kids table while Happy Hogan (Jon Faverau) ""monitors"" his progress. The adults tend to ignore Peter Parker as he gives minor help and juggles his life at high school. He still wants to prove himself, and eventually stumbles across Toomes' team as they try to sell weapons fueled by alien technology, and rob from ATMs. Happy and Tony tell Spidey to stay out of the big stuff, but not much else. Spidey is desperate to prove he is ready and pursues the low-lying crime syndicate on his own. He does a few impressive things, but eventually, his endeavors backfire. Tony Stark/Ironman has to bail him out, and takes the suit. Alone, Spidey has to figure out how to save the day. There are a few gripes to get out of the way. First is the Spider-Man suit from Stark can do as much as the Ironman suit. This takes away from Peter's ingenuity and creativity he displays in the comics. Secondly, the Aunt May character is underused, undeveloped, and miscast. And this seems to be a conscious decision by writers and producers to focus on the Peter Parker cadre at school. Aunt May is a prominent character, and can show all of strength as Rosemary Harris proved in Spider-Man 2. Finally, the lacking of adults in the movie spreads to the crew as well. With the focus on high school, mostly Peter's peers, it is a high school movie. Of course, Peter is in high school, and attempting to reconcile his aspirations for peers and his responsibility. On the other hand, the strengths of homecoming outpace this missteps. The first kudos is to Tom Holland who portrays the web-slinger with such conflict, hope, and frustration so well. Between his anger with Happy and Tony, and reconciling his disappearances with Aunt May and his friends, and trying to impress the Avengers, Holland gives us an earnest performance. The audience will believe he is 16. Just as good is Michael Keaton as Adrian Toomes. As a Spider-Man comic collector, I never held the Vulture is high regard. That goes the opposite way in this cinematic adaptation. This was the best villain since Doc Ock in Spider-Man 2. He does garner sympathy to a certain extent, but Keaton gives the Toomes character the right amount of bitterness, anger, and desperation. Finally, there is a Spider-Man who has to reckon with being a kid and wanting to be an adult with adult figures failing him. As a kid, he makes mistakes because he does not stop to think things through. This is Spider-Man movie of the future. It works, and works well. It still does not have the power and gravitas of the original Raimi/Maguire movies (1-2), but it is a great one for the ages.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

","Here's my review of spiderman : homecoming. So , Tom Holland was great as spiderman . He was funny , athletic and smart just like how you saw him in civil war. Michael Keaton was great as the vulture , even though he could have been a little more intimidating , not just the bad guy , the whole plot could've been a little dark , it was too cheesy , I'm not saying bad , but it was cheesy like its TV series . Some things which pissed me off , was how spiderman talked to the AI in his suit and depended a lot on stark tech , because spiderman talks to himself while swinging by and one of the original traits of his is not depending on tech except for his web shooters . The supporting cast was great too , especially the fat Asian dude . Aunt may was good in this movie , but more uncle Ben memories would have boosted the emotional drive , which was lacking in this movie. Iron man was cool , and he knew his place without crowding it. The music in this movie is really cool and that too how they did a remix to the classic theme song which blended really well with the action sequences. In the end , homecoming is a perfect summer movie with lots of cheesiness , web slinging fun and wall crawling action and perfectly timed one liners.

","This is the best Spider-Man movie ever made. Unlike the other Marvel movies, this was a reboot, and has very high expectations to live up to. It succeeded all expectations spectacularly. However, it did so in a very unique way. Marvel took a risk, instead of doing the usual uncle Ben dying, and Peter getting bitten by the Spider, they jumped right into the movie. Of course the only reason they did this was because Spider-Man already got introduced in Civil War, and that was 6 months after he got bit. They also completely changed some of the classic Spider-Man characters, and introduced some new ones. A good example was Flash. In Toby Maguire's, and Andrew Garfield's Spider-Mans, Flash was a huge bully, in this Spider-Man, Flash is still somewhat of a bully, but not in a physical way, he is also smaller, and even smarter. This is the third version of Spider-Man, and we got a third girlfriend. The original one had MJ, Andrew Garfield's has Gwen Stacy, and now we have Liz. It was cool how they built the story around Liz's dad being the main villain, the Vulture, they haven't really done that with a Spider-Man girlfriend before. We also got introduced to Ned, and different MJ who isn't Mary Jane. I though Ned was great, he silliness gave me a couple good laughs. I also liked MJ's character, I can't wait to see more of her, especially since her role will get bigger in the next Spider-Man movies. The last thing I will talk about it the acting, it was all great, from Peter's friends, to Michael Keaton as the Vulture, to the younger aunt May, but Tom Holland's was amazing. Out of the three Spider-Mans, Toby Maguire, Andrew Garfield, and Tom Holland, I think Tom was the best.

","""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" (2017), most of you guys already know that I absolutely loathe ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" films with Andrew Garfield. He's such a disgrace to the character of Spider-Man/Peter Parker! Tobey Maguire is, and will always be Spider-Man. But, when I saw Tom Holland as the character in ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016), I didn't think he did that bad. His performance isn't as great as Tobey Maguire's in that movie. That being said, he's a much better actor for the character than Andrew Garfield! I wasn't too keen on seeing ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" to begin with. But, since Robert Downey Jr. Was going to be in it, I gave it a chance. It was better than I thought it was going to be. However, the more I watched it, the more I disliked it. More flaws began to unravel in this tangled up web of a ""film""! ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" has a boring and slow storyline, standard to terrible acting, and an predictable generic soundtrack to try and tie this diarrhea stain together. The plot is, Peter Parker attempts to balance his life as Spider-Man with his personal life, but ends up running into conflicts along the way. Yeah, it's about as basic a story as it sounds. It's way too pedestrian, and it never really shines for me. One glaring issue I have with this ""movie"", is that we never see how this version of Spider-Man/Peter Parker got his powers in the first place. Granted, it's not something we have to see, as most of us know how it all began in the first place. We're all just supposed to watch it and accept it. Another problem, is that there's no Uncle Ben in this ""film"". He's never even mentioned here! Did none of the writers read a comic book? Or, do any research? There's been a helpful invention called the Internet. It's a very interesting tool, quite frankly I'm very excited about it (yes, I'm being completely sarcastic). Probably the biggest issue I have with this storyline, is the fact that Spider-Man/Peter Parker is basically just a teacher's pet to Tony Stark/Iron Man. Spider-Man is supposed to be living his own solo life, hence the expression: ""your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man""! Now, he could get recruited later on in a future film. I think that this ""movie"" should've come before ""Captain America: Civil War"". Bottom line, the plot is just underwhelming overall. The script would've benefitted so much from a simple rewrite. This ""film"" is yet another origin story we've seen a million times. That being said, it really had the potential to be so much more. As for the acting, it's just as terrible as the storyline. The whole cast is just hit and miss for me. The best performances in this ""movie"" come from Michael Keaton as Adrian Toomes/Vulture and of course Robert Downey Jr. As Tony Stark/Iron Man. Tom Holland doesn't do that bad with his acting though. However, probably the most distracting thing with him is how young he is. You can really hear it in his voice! I think he was way too young to play this character. The character's name is supposed to be Spider-Man, not Spider-Boy! But, probably the worst performances come from Zendaya as Michelle and Jacob Batalon as Ned. Zendaya is boring to watch, and Jacob Batalon is cringe-worthy! Another problem here, is the casting of Aunt May, which was also a huge issue in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" films. Wow, and I thought Sally Field was too young for the role. Marisa Tomei is practically middle-aged! The character, May Parker, is supposed to be an older woman with gray hair. Why can't any of the casting agents get that right? Her performance is all right, but looking at her on the screen is just a huge distraction! Seriously, if you watched this ""movie"" for the first time, and someone were to tell you that was May Parker, you'd say: ""that's May Parker?! Really?"" At least they got the high school characters in the right age range. That being said, the whole cast is just a huge letdown! As far as the soundtrack goes, it's about as generic as you can get. That was a huge shock for me, because Michael Giacchino wrote and composed the film score! Usually, he writes great soundtracks for movies. What happened to him here? Now granted, there are bits and pieces throughout that aren't too bad and some of the song choices are okay. But, the music just didn't do much for me, which is a shame. I really expected more from Michael Giacchino for this ""film""! Any way, let's just move on to the only two good elements in this piece of crap. The only good things are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are great and give this ""film"" a decent atmosphere. You can't go wrong with filming your movie in New York City! As far as the special effects go, they are well-done and still hold up today. Which is no surprise, being made in 2017! ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is yet another pointless origin superhero film. The pacing is way too slow and for the majority of the time, nothing happens. Is it the worst superhero movie I've ever seen? No, not even close. But, it's still, by my high standards, a terrible movie. I'm struggling to give this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Unless you're a fan of the comic books, or the character Spider-Man/Peter Parker, avoid this ""movie"" at all costs. I'm not even going to bother with the worthless sequels! Like I said, after ""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019), I'm done with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That, for me, is the true ending of the series. Hence the name, ""Endgame""! Everything after that, is just nothing but pointless cash-grabs. Another annoying thing, is that the names of these Spider-Man films incorporate the word ""Home"" into the titles. That's just plain dumb! Any way, just stay away from ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"". All it will do is just make you want to rush home!",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

904,7 July 2017,MikeEhms,6," A generic high school movie that works as a good Spidey movie
","Spider-Man Homecoming was a solid, fun, and charming film. While it's nowhere near great I would say that it's one of the better Spidey movies. There's a lot that I like and not much I didn't enjoy. For one thing I thought Tom Holland was pretty great as both Peter Parker AND Spider-Man (which has never been done before in the movies). It's a different representation of the character since he's so young, but it works to the film's advantage since he screws up a lot as he should. There's even a few harsh moments with him that legitimately impressed me. The acting overall was very good. With my second favorite performance being Michael Keaton as Adrian Toomes. Michael Keaton is great in everything and here he really gets to shine, especially in the later parts of the movie. Only issue with him was how it sounded like he tried to have a thick NY accent early on but then just stopped after a bit. But I gotta say, he's without a shred of a doubt the best Marvel villain. Marisa Tomei as Hot Aunt May was also really enjoyable as there were quite a few funny moments around her being unnaturally attractive. The humor was also much better than I expected. It's a very light-hearted movie without feeling as tonally unbalanced as some other Marvel movies, and the quips from Spider-Man are always fun. Another thing is that the cinematography is surprisingly really good. There's a lot of great shots and a good color palette that suits the movie's tone. From a directing standpoint this movie is much better/more defined than most other Marvel films recently. Where my issues begin to emerge is mainly with the writing. This is every single high school movie you've ever seen, mixed with a generic superhero movie that happens to be about Spider-Man. It doesn't necessarily do this stuff poorly, but none of it is unique either. The romance subplot is especially mediocre. It goes through the same beats as every other one you've seen and is riddled with terribly clichéd dialogue. It's definitely the weakest out of all the films because at least in ASM Emma and Andrew's chemistry was fantastic. And in the Raimi movies Mary Jane was fairly developed as a character. Another thing I wasn't crazy for was the emphasis on the Avengers and the rest of the MCU. Even though there were a lot of clever and meta bits where it showed how a post Avengers world would operate, it seemed a little heavy-handed. Especially with Tony Stark. I'm glad that he's not in the movie as much as I thought he would be, and I like how he's trying to be a sort of father figure. But I felt like he was the executives' way of implanting all the sequel-baiting and setting-up-for-Infinity-War into the film. Which is a negative cuz I when I see a Spider-Man film I wanna see a Spider-Man film, not another Marvel movie. My last problem is that I felt like this film really lacked much of an emotional grit to it. For the most part the sequence of events just kinda feel like a sequence of events with no real consequences. There is a scene before the third act that really held some weight to it and brought a bit of that grit to the film. There's also a little moment in the final battle where Tom Holland does his best bit of acting as he truly felt vulnerable and hurt, that with some great imagery also brought some much needed drama to it. I get that it's ultimately a kids' movie, but a good sense of weight to situation could've really made the emotional moments even more powerful. Any other issues I have are minor like product-placement, stretches in logic that the movie itself set up, and a way characters react to Peter's final action that seems out of place. Overall, I really enjoyed Spider-Man Homecoming for what it was and accepted that it's not perfect by any means; I would gladly see it again.

907,12 February 2018,jamesrupert2014,7," Light-hearted superhero romp
","In the third reboot of Spiderman since Toby Maguire first starred as the webslinger in 2002 is a more-or-less bloodless adventure yarn pitting Spiderman (Tom Holland) against ""The Vulture"" (Michael Keaton). Having established the character in the previous ""Captain America: Civil War"" film (2016), this solo outing doesn't include the 'bitten by a radioactive' spider backstory and essentially starts off with the cleanup of alien artifacts following the climactic battle in ""The Avengers"" (2012). Salvage contractor Adrian Toomes (Keaton), bitter after getting cut from the project by the D.O.D.C, starts manufacturing and selling arms based on stolen alien technology and young Peter Parker, wanting to prove himself worthy of joining the Avengers, decides to stop him. The film plays up Parker's combination of superhuman abilities and teenage angst more so than the previous installments and provides him with a new comic-relief side-kick (""Ned"", Jacob Batalon). Holland is fine as the titular hero, as is Keaton as his nemesis. In keeping with trend for fantastic (and very convenient do-all-that-the-plot-requires) technology in these movies, Spiderman's suit is designed by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and has endless built in gadgetry, including a personal assistant. The Vulture gets a complete makeover: the winged old guy with the furry neckpiece is replaced by Tommes in his high-tech flying suit (with a fur-collared flight jacket for old times' sake). Peter's elderly Aunt May has also received a makeover and is now played a much younger and sexier Marisa Tomei. When not focusing on Parker's high-school woes, the movie moves at a frenetic pace. I didn't find it as 'real' looking or as interesting as the Maguire versions and some of the action set-pieces (such as the Staten Island Ferry scenes) are absurd to a point of ridiculousness. I also found Spiderman's strength (and the strength/adhesiveness of his webbing) to vary as the plot demanded (weak internal consistency is a common problem with 'superhero' movies and (IMO) is a sure sign of sloppy/lazy writing). Not bad but just more of the same Marvel: neither memorable nor rewatchable.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

And many many many efforts for antiracism. Was this spider man or an activist promotion film?So peter parker's best friend is a fat asian kid now,his high schooll bully is indian(flash) and an overall decent kid and student,his crush is african american and mary jane is an ebony(?) stalker, always following parker around and her name is ""MJ for her friends"" while her name is not Mary Jane at all?What?!And shocker is a useless white guy killed off by another white guy only to be replaced by another useless guy, but this time black!?And Parker himself is kinda redhead with freckles?
-Besides that, the plot was weak, the pace was uneven and the story telling was poor to say the least, resulting in a cringy and kinda boring film. Spider man was goofing around all the time, he seemed extremely weak and useless. And that would be fine if they had not previously presented him in ""civil war"" as a guy who could fight captain america on equal footing ,and that while being able to afford more goofing around at the time. No continuity whatsover. As for story telling etc...look at the beginning: And here we have SPIDER MAN!!DA TA!...Of course we all know about spider man but shouldn't they show us how he got his powers?How his parents or uncle die?Especially his uncle's death was supposed to be a critical moment in spider man's character shaping.And what about people who have not seen or read about spider-man before,how will they know how he got his powers and what his powers are exactly?I mean, these things are pretty basic. And what about the villains?Do all trash disposal companies hire MIT graduates to get rid of trash and ruins or is it that easy for anyone to hack and modify alien technology and reshape it into human-style weapons? Another thing, his friend was such a genius at computers that could easily hack the high tech suit Iron Man gave him?Like that?And without Stark getting wind of it?Then we have Iron Man coming up and sticking together a boat while it's flooding and he just flies away like that?And what about his aunt?She was more like his older and smoking hot stepsister. Ans she finds out his secret like that? And I can go on and on but I thing you get the picture here. And what about Shocker?He is black now?After Electro who was also made to be black in the previous reboot?And I do not care about the colour of his skin. He could be pakistani for all I care. But there is no point presenting us with a story only to change it later for a political(ly correct) agenda. It is a matter of continuity.Black torch,black electro,black shocker.Are we looking forward to an all black hero and villain series so that people won't call you racist? Changing a character or story in general for that reason, is racist by itself.And to be clear on that, I am not racist.I like all people if they're nice.

Also though they've nailed the feel of the comics, they've not felt too burdened by them, allowing themselves to update things to reflect our times, perfectly portrayed by the update to the Flash Thomson character. In fact all the surrounding characters are excellent with particular kudos to Jacob Batalan's Ned. And also it has one of the most relate-able and strongest baddies so far in Marvel in Keaton's Vulture. Though you can't pass by the fact that he's making and selling weapons of, if not mass, at least major destruction to any tom, dick or harry, you can relate to how he feels betrayed by the system, and his speech to Peter about how the little people feed off the scraps of the big table does hit home a little. And the action, though not as spectacular as some of the bigger set pieces of previous films is perfect for the scale of this movie and is in at least one scene quite scary and moving at the same time.

This picks up not long after the events of ""Captain America: Civil War"" and Peter Parker (Holland) is starting to get the feel as web-slinging vigilante, Spider-Man. Downey Jr. reprises his role as Tony Stark/Iron Man who is sort of a mentor to him and he tests Peter's determination to become a superhero. Soon, Peter discovers that there's hi-tech weapons being sold on the streets by salvager, Adrian Toomes (Keaton) who takes the guise of Vulture and he tries to stop him. Tomei (My Cousin Vinny) plays Peter's Aunt, May, Jon Favreau, Chris Evans and Gwyneth Paltrow also reprise their roles from ""Iron Man,"" ""Captain America"" & ""The Avengers."" Creator, Stan Lee also makes an amusing cameo as usual. This is a great Spider-Man film, Holland gives the best portrayal of the character so far in my opinion, Keaton is great as usual and the rest of the cast is also good.

","Spider-Man: Homecoming was a great solo introduction to Tom Holland's Spider-Man. It gives watchers who know a thing or two about the comics and Spider-Man's characters a chance to get excited for the future. Following Civil War, Peter Parker really holds on to Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark as a mentor, and I think that was a great quality to give to Spider-Man - something we hadn't seen in the previous franchises. Another great quality was his suit. Not to mention we didn't have to watch another origin story and another Uncle Ben die. Michael Keaton's Vulture was amazing, and a true menace for a teenaged superhero. The big surprise near the end was something I'm still surprised about today. It's funny, it's intense, and it's just a really good Spider-Man movie.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

","I didn't think I would come out of the theater from Homecoming with the thought in my mind that this movie features the most effective plot twist of any movie this year. I certainly won't spoil it because it makes the movie and is so perfectly done that it was enough to bump this movie up to a 10/10. Tom Holland does amazing work as Peter Parker/Spiderman and is most certainly the most believable and effective actor to portray the actor on the big screen to date. We knew he was good from Civil War but a standalone feature of his own really allows him to embody the geeky and reckless side of the character. This Spiderman isn't very good at his job initially, but develops into an effective Avenger with the hilarious guidance of Tony Stark/Iron Man. Michael Giachinno's score is excellent as always and the action sequences are your typical web-slinger fair. Michael Keaton is probably the stand-out newcomer in the movie who delivers the most effective portrayal of a comic villain since Heath Ledger's legendary performance as joker, seriously, Keaton is that good. I could not recommend this movie enough to anyone looking for a good time at the theater and eagerly await Holland's return to the character in the upcoming Avengers: Infinity War.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

","A charming coming of age tale wrapped up in a giddy spiderweb, Spider-Man: Homecoming may not be the best of the Spider-Man films but it does solidify Tom Holland as the best actor to take on the role so far. I'll be honest, I had high expectations for this film. It wasn't as great as I wanted it to be, but it was enjoyable, and did prove to be a decent flick- but it's clearly not as good as the first two Raimi flicks or The Amazing Spider-Man. What shines best about this film is easily the acting, and it's clearly the best acted film in the franchise so far. Tom Holland is a perfect Spider-Man and we also get some fantastic supporting performances, such as Michael Keaton as Vulture, Tony Stark as the infamous Iron Man, Marisa Tomei as Aunt May, Zendaya as MJ, and of course Jacob Batalon as Peter's best friend Ned. The film is heavy handed on its themes of anxiety, managing school life with work life, and it's honestly a bit chaotic to watch at times. It's also a bit too long, and honestly could have been trimmed down about 20 minutes or so. Its storytelling is nothing special for the most part, but it does have an excellent way of bringing around Keaton's character throughout the film, and some excellent little twists here and there. In the end, Spider-Man: Homecoming is not my favorite like I used to think it was, but it does manage to be a charming flick most of the time, and it certainly is a great showcase for Tom Holland as the titular character.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

","I really didn't fancy going to see Spider-Man: Homecoming but with there being no football at the moment and my youngest pestering me to go , I succumbed . I haven't really been into Spider-Man since the cartoon TV show of the seventies and with all the changes of lead actors I wasn't holding out great hope but I was pleasantly surprised. Thrilled by his experience with the Avengers, Peter Parker returns home under the watchful eye of his new mentor Tony Stark . Parker tries to fall back into his normal daily routine—distracted by thoughts of proving himself to be more than just your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man—but when the Vulture (Michael Keaton) emerges as a new villain, he finds that there is a massive conflict between his Spidey life and his private life. Tom Holland is excellent as the new Spider-Man. He's playing a 15 year old Peter Parker and that will definitely appeal to the kids. In fact the whole film feels like it's aimed at the younger market. There is less death and destruction than a usual Avengers movie ( and this IS an Avengers movie) and more references to what teenagers are into. Some of the special affects are amazing especially one scene where Spider-Man climbs up the Washington Monument ( great in 3D) also a scene on a ferry.

959,6 July 2017,eden-rabatsch,8," Spider Boy - John Hughes meets comic book action
","Welcome home SpiderBoy! It is not often that a film that is a reboot of a reboot in a universe pumping out about three films a year somehow, improbably, fills you with movie joy. The difficulty level that Jon Watts faced as one of six writers and with a scant directing resume would have been enough to (and has) destroyed more seasoned professionals and yet the team has produced a film brimming with teen angst, recklessness, heroism – The Breakfast Club for superheroes. The film is set just after the Battle of New York where we see alien artifacts are being harvested and some for nefarious purposes. Jump ahead a few years and Peter Parker/Spiderman played by Tom Holland is extremely keen to prove himself and get on the Avengers team and out of high school. Soon he becomes aware of a villain called The Vulture, ironically played by The Birdman Michael Keaton, who has assembled a gang of high tech thieves. All this is played against the travails of detention, teen crushes and being caught half way between kid and adulthood. Let's start with Jon Watts. I am actually amazed that he got this gig. I have never seen a Jon Watts' film though I have had his horror film ""Clown"" on my list for a while now. Still five films and then a 175 million dollar blockbuster – that must have been some pitch! There were six or so writers which normally is a death knell for any film. Very hard for a film to have a consistent tone with that many voices but Spiderman HC does it. I suspect it is because we have two films being made – one, a by the letter superhero film and the other a teen comedy. The writers look like they stayed on their respective fields with Watts and Kevin Feige (the Marvel ringmaster) keeping it all on point. Watts deftly keeps all the balls in the air and has a career about to rocket after this achievement. Watts was helped greatly by some impressive casting. Remember, Tobey Maguire and Tom Holland are only a year apart but Maguire acted like he was 35 and Holland looks all of the 15 that his Peter Parker represents. Watts needs to buy the Russo brothers a drink for casting Holland in ""Captain America: Civil War"" as he lights up the screen as a totally credible teenager. He is just reckless enough, just heroic enough, shy but with ego – he really sells the role. Scene stealer Jacob Batalon as his best friend Ned gives great comic relief but also does a lot of heavy lifting in making the teen universe seem real. The rest of the cast are brilliant. I really mean this – nearly every small role has a great young actor or comedian. Matthew Starr as a teacher, Donald Glover as a small time crook (even funnier as Glover once lobbied to be Spidey), Bokeem Woodbine, Hannibal Burress even Jennifer Connelly as Karen, Spidey's Costume AI. Still it is a truism that holds that the true measure of a superhero film is the villain against which he battles. Michael Keaton plays Adrian Toomes aka The Vulture. This is an interesting portrayal because he is a post Trump villain. Whenever he does something evil he can justify it as being put down by the big guys. I suspect people would vote for him. His group of villains are also relatively small scale. He is more Tony Soprano then The Godfather. Keaton is having a great mid-career renaissance and he has that excellent range that allows him to pivot between scenes, he never becomes cartoonish. This is an agile movie which for the most part is played for small stakes. The fact that the viewer is as worried about The Vulture as whether Peter will get to the Homecoming dance says a lot about the skill at play here. The film does suffer from being one set piece too long. At 133 minutes it would have been better served at coming in 15 or so minutes shorter. These are quibbles in the end because I laughed and aahed all the way through it. The Washington Monument set piece is beautifully composed mixing CGI and practical effects for maximum fun. This film owes just as much to John Hughes as it does to Sam Raimi and for me that is a heavenly cocktail.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

","Great casting with Holland and Keaton, but I honestly wanted more scenes with Keaton. Awesome to see him as a super villain. The villain gets plenty of screen time but a lot of it is the vulture character and Keaton was at his best out of costume. Passable story line. With 12 credited writers, this felt a bit like a patchwork of ideas, some that worked for me and some that didn't. Some of the best scenes were the comedy. Some of the CGI action looked a little jerky to me, in that way that all the other Marvel action looks. Loved that they took the character back to high school. Didn't 'feel' the chemistry between him and the girl so some of that drama fell flat. They could have toned down Parkers 'spaz' moments just a little.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

The film doesn't bother to tell what is already known about Peter's story, this is another version of the character who, having already received the powers, is still in his early days as a hero. Tony Stark becomes Peter's mentor, who little by little teaches him the path of the hero. This film presents us with a more colorful and cartoonish version of Spider-Man that makes some miss Tobey McGuire's Peter, but it ends up being enjoyable. Michael Keaton is another notable element of the film and he does his role as the Vulture very well. This movie is just a start to meet the Spider-Man of the MCU.

","Dear readers, yesterday was the first day of screening of Spiderman: Homecoming in my home country, Indonesia. For Indonesian people, the figure of Spiderman has been becoming a symbol of young, brave, and honest superhero, other than Batman with its political conflicts or Superman with its science fiction method. For us, Spiderman is like the representation of a real hero in the society. Spiderman is not rich like Batman, nor having inter-galaxies power like Superman. Spiderman is a college student, being bitten by miraculous spider, and then becoming a hero during nights. Now in 2017, Spiderman movie is back and we are so excited to watch it. Firstly because of the title with the word ""Homecoming"". This makes people curious. ""What happens to Spiderman?"", ""Why he needs Homecoming?"" or ""What is Homecoming itself?"". So here it is my review!! Spiderman: Homecoming is the story about the Spiderman at the age of college student, young, beauty, clumsy, confused, narcissist, and other characters linked to a college student. Those characters make this movie really fresh and give some fun to the watchers. The next critical point is some physical appearances of Tony Stark (Iron Man) and Avengers team. For those who are not following the Avengers so intensely, maybe would be confused what is the link between Spiderman and Iron Man. The other thing that maybe the Director want to show us, is the plots concerning to illegal business or black markets within superhero equipment. That movie's plot is quite new and intriguing fact that a hero always needs a modern and updated thing also in the modern globalization time, including online videos. Too many good points to be judged for this movie, but for me, the minus point is only the action of Spiderman. He is everywhere in the movie, of course, but his actions are not so cool like Toby Maguire ever did. Well, but yes, I still recommend this movie since you will know the young face of Mary Jane :) Happy watching, Spiderman fans!!",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

1024,1 September 2021,hoernkeem,9," Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017, Jon Watts) Spider-Man in MCU for reals now... great entry! great Peter Parker! great villain!
","Oh what's in a name. Homecoming for this latest Spider-Man incarnation obviously functions on a few levels the most glaring of which is the real world allusion to the fact that Spider-Man finally comes home under the umbrella of Marvel studios. Everyone seemed to understand that this would be high point not only for the studio but for Spider-Man as a film character as he has languished for years unable to get the right story and actor to truly make the character shine. To give credit though I think because of recent missteps we tend to think Spider-Man has never been good, but in all honesty Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire did the best they could in the first two volumes of Raimi's webslinger trilogy. Maguire, however, was never the ideal for the role and despite his best effort his very presence weighed the films down. 'Spider-Man 3' was an unmitigated disaster and the Andrew Garfield reboots further mired the character with bloated stories, labored special effects, lackluster villains and retreaded territory with yet again more Spidey origin story. 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' is an amazing film that not only revitalizes the character but also adds another interesting addendum to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Awesomely rolled out as a special guest star in 'Captain America: Civil War' Tom Holland's Spider-Man only hinted at the excellence to come. This film throws off the burdensome backstory and brings Spider-Man squarely back into the realm of high school. This is about as good as a PG-13 super hero flick can get and immediately earns a place among the best MCU films to date. And all this from a director (who is Jon Watts??) who has nothing on this level to speak of adding fuel to the fire that it is Kevin Feigie as producer that makes this world go round in the MCU and not necessarily the director. The film starts brilliantly with selfie videos from Peter Parker himself as he is whisked off with little information or fanfare to Berlin for his role in 'Civil War'. We get a hilarious recap of the battle from his point of view which does a great job of introducing us to the character but also reminding audiences that this Spider-Man exists squarely in the world of the Avengers. Post battle Stark lets him keep the suit that Stark designed and while Parker awaits a potential recall to the Avengers big leagues we see him being the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man as he does his thing on the streets of Queens. That in and of itself is telling as well as this film is kept for the most part in the working class section of NYC eschewing the glitz and glamor of Manhattan. We also see Peter interacting at school as the nerd he is hanging with his best friend and wistfully longing, perhaps somewhat creepily, as high school nerds are apt to do, after the hottest girl in school. Meanwhile we are also introduced to Adrian Toomes who is to become the villain Vulture. So much is good about Keaton and his portrayal of this villain who is much more grounded and relateable than your standard superhero bad guys. He seems like a man of our times, and very much a product of the current state of national affairs. He runs a salvage company that cleans up after super hero battles and when we first meet him he is cleaning up after the Avengers battle from the first Avengers film, but all of a sudden thanks to the government and Tony Stark the contract is ripped away from this seemingly good man and now his livelihood and family become threatened. Not only is his portrayal great he takes what could be a hokey villain and makes him intensely menacing. The look of the Vulture is perfect. It is also wonderful how they synced up Toomes' timeline right into the timeline of the MCU. It works so well! Toomes essentially starts a criminal enterprise stealing the alien tech that he was salvaging before and selling it on the black market. While Parker is waiting for his next big super hero break he stumbles across this villain and his criminal malfeasance in his own back yard and it seems to him that no one is listening to him so he takes matters into his own hands to stop the Vulture. The story works so well and the film makers do a great job of dovetailing Spider-Man into the MCU but also keeping him distinctly his own entity which becomes even more prevalent at the end of the film. There are hilarious cameos from Captain America reprising his PSA videos from back in the day. Also there is a twist in this film that, judging from audience reaction, no one even remotely saw coming. Thank God, at least for now, we had no mention of Uncle Ben, or great power and great responsibility or even Parker's photography or the Daily Bugle. There is only a small reference to his creation taken care of in one line of dialogue to his best friend and confidant. My actual problems with this movie are slight and really splitting hairs. The only off character for me was Zendaya's Michelle. She was just way to alternative and off putting with her too cool for school yet school is actually sorta cool mentality that I thought her odd appearances and short off kilter statements were jarring and a bit out of place in the overall narrative. The only other thing is I wish the final battle would've been a bit more of a bigger, intense set piece. The final battle seemed to happen very quickly and I just wanted more with some big flair shot to really capture that battle like the splitting ferry with Spidey suspended between the two halves really cemented that scene. And speaking of that ferry shot while it was very good it immediately brought to mind the iconic rail shot from 'Spider-Man 2' where Maguire was out in front of a runaway train and stopped using his webs and strength. To this day that remains probably my favorite scene and sequence in the Spider-Man series of films. It kind of surprises me that they would film a scene so similar in execution to that one. All of these criticisms can be taken with a grain of salt though. This film is truly magnificent and is great from the first frame to the last (and I do mean the last). There is full of content for causal fans and afficionados alike and with a little luck Marvel will be allowed to continue to make Spider-Man the marquis film character he was always meant to be. Hallelujah, the long dark night of Spider-Man's film soul is at an end.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017
1025,20 October 2017,adamsmith-51004,6," Possibly the weakest Spider-Man film
","First of all let me start off by saying that I am a huge fan of Spider-Man and that he is one of the best comic book superheroes. After the very poor The Amazing Spider-Man 2 I suppose it made sense to give Spider-Man a reboot. I like many were excited by the prospect of Marvel being involved. Went to see this film with my brothers and after hearing only positive reviews went in confident of the fun being good. The film has some good points Tom Holland is very good as Peter Parker and Spider-Man and is very much like his personality from the comics. However, I can't say much more about the film positively. Spider-Man is and has nearly always worked alone so don't see the reason for iron man making him effectively his b****. According to this film iron man designed the famous suit. He also tells Spider-Man what he can and cannot do. Instead of Spider-Man being a hero finding his way it came across as him being stupid. In many of the scenes he messes up and te fight with vulture who once again in movie form we have to have a mechanical suit he ends up defeating himself. Also the amount of people in this movie that find out he is Spider-Man is ridiculous, first his best friend and then right at the end the very poorly cast aunt may.

","Spiderman Homecoming is a fun movie, and certainly worth watching. Holland does a phenomenal job and is charismatic and realistic in the titular role. The interactions and plot are reasonable, as the context and Parker were developed well. I did feel like many of the flaws that were lurking came out to full display in a lackluster third act. The villains were bland and didn't have any depth to them. As frequently happens, there were many implausible leaps, with Parker surviving and getting out of situations at will and the climax of the Avengers having 0 foresight and the bad guy thinks of everything, and then Parker takes the plane down by winning a fight with the vulture. His interactions with Stark also seemed a bit forced and not nuanced, with Stark being unambiguously angry and happy in the climaxes of the second and third acts, respectively. Parker's decision at the end also just seemed bizarre that he'd turn it down and not reach some sort of agreement. It felt like an attempt to show character development, but was just a ""mature"" decision contrary to what he had done to that point and was just a token decision to show a change. Many characters and elements of Parker's life were realistic and intelligently planned for, but the ending just felt like pure deus ex machina to make the Vulture seem unstoppable and then have Parker handily defeat it.

","I am going to keep this review short, sweet, and simple. This Spidey movie may be better than Spider-Man 2 in certain aspects. I really enjoyed both the action, and the acting. Tom Holland is great as both Peter Parker, and his alter-ego Spider-Man. You can really feel his anxiety, and empathize with him. Michael Keaton actually makes for a fantastic intimidating villain with his own moral code in this one. You both sympathize with, and despise the guy at the same time. I never thought I'd see the day where I actually would like Vulture. The rest of the supporting cast play their roles fairly well too; especially Peter's friend Ned Leeds. He is a funny side character with a few standout scenes of his own. There were a couple of scenes where I found myself chuckling. The action in this one is pretty stellar, and Spider- Man is exactly how he should be in this one. He is the wise cracking, swashbuckling teenage hero he was intended to be. The costume is better than any previous iteration in my opinion. This one made more sense in a lot of ways, and was more faithful to the comics. They even play an adaptation of his old cartoon theme!

He has the character's charisma and manages to make good jokes, the biggest problem is Peter Parker. He seems not to suffer consequences and his entire school and family nucleus is very weak.

After watching spiderman trilogy and amazing spiderman movies, I can say that homecoming is an enjoyable peter Parker movie. Its defiantly better than amazing spiderman but is no way near to the 'spiderman 2'
Peter has all this stark tech which kind of overshadow the spiderman elements. The character development of the villain here is most important for a superhero movie, which i think was a bit off here.
Even when i see the train fight sequence from the spiderman 2, it makes me nervous and I care for spiderman, even though i have seen the movie like 10 times. The impact of that sequence shows who spiderman really is.
In spiderman homecoming, people on the ship are actually saved by ironman. I'm not saying its a bad thing. But as a spiderman stand alone film it was just like an introduction of spiderman in the MCU.

","I think they have finally got the character of Spider-man right. He's a great mix of the nerdy, uncool Peter Parker we went and the cocky, quipping Spider-Man. And while they do great with him and give him a good character arc, I think they failed for the most part with other characters. Zendaya's Michelle shows up here and there to say a quip and then disappears. Otherwise she's mainly thrown in as a set up for a future movie. Aunt May doesn't have much to do in this film besides be the ""hot Aunt"" that everyone hits on. Donald Glover is in the movie for 2 scenes and he also is mainly there as a potential set up for a future movie. The only other character that I felt was decently fleshed out was Adrian Toomes (Vulture). I think they gave him some good backstory for why he hated Iron Man/The Avengers so much. And there were several good fights between him and Spider-man where he had the upper hand. And there was a really great acted, tension filled moment between the two of them in a car. And that's all I say about that scene because I'm trying to keep this review as spoiler free as possible. I think he was one of the better villains. The other weird thing I want to point out, is the timeline doesn't make sense. When we are first introduced to Vulture, its right after the events of the first Avengers (which was like 2012 I believe) but then it cuts to an ""8 years later screen. Which either means this takes places in like 2020. Or The Avengers was taking place in like 2009. However, later in the film Happy Hogan makes a reference to something he's been holding onto since 2008 (which is when the first Iron Man came out). So......very confusing. I know some people don't like the fact that Iron Man built Spider-man's suit, but I think it makes sense for this universe and it does provide for a really funny scene once he gets the ""training wheels"" off and doesn't know how to use it because Tony went overboard with all the options. There is also plenty of other funny moments in the film, one of my favourites had to do with Ferris Bueller. I'm not sure how would I rank it amongst the other MCU movies. There's so many at this point, and I feel like I would have to do a re-watch.

This man has single handedly saved the MCU from the dreaded villain curse. You want to talk about character development. Wow he gave a strong and intimidating performance as The Vulture. Peters best friend Ned, Aunt May, Tony Stark and even Happy the Butler all kept me glued to the Screen throughout the film. Now let's talk about the action. Very well paced action and pretty intense scenes, I mean you can tell that Peter was out of his league. Even the Shocker was pretty damn powerful and gave Spider- Man a run for his money. With MCU and the signature comedy lines it was well placed to make a pretty great summer blockbuster. The MCU does a great job with taking a genre and adding super heroes to it. For example Cap 2 was a espionage film and Ant Man was a heist film. Spider-Man Home coming is definitely a high school teen movie with a super hero twist.

Seems I was wrong. After years of ""Spider-man"" film adaptations, the origins have been redone by Andrew Garfield (2012) after they were adapted by Tobey Maguire, ten years earlier, with many of the memorable and interesting villains already being adapted. That's why I was glad to see no more origins. ""Spider-man: Homecoming"" is about Peter Parker trying to pair his social and superhero life together in the peak of adolescence. Meanwhile, Spider-man, his alter-ego/superhero identity, is trying to find his 'big break' in the superhero world, competing against a range of factors (e.g. school, love-life, age, etc).",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

1115,11 July 2017,mihai_aliman,5," Ambiguous morally, unconvincing hero
","Marvel proposed another kind of Spider-Man, free from all the bad reboots. The film pictures Peter Parker, much younger than the previous versions, in an unexplainable and selfish attempt to catch the attention of Tony Stark (more on that later). He is still the nerdy, awkward, super smart teenage boy, but this time portrayed in a much racially diverse and politically correct environment: his love interest, Liz, is black, his best friend, Ned, is Filipino, his bully, Flash, appears to be of Indian origin. There are only hints of Peter's life up to this point, nothing very explicit. Not starting the story arc from the beginning might have been a good thing, nobody wanted to see Uncle Ben die again. But still, the Uncle played a very important role in the origin story, as the father-figure and the voice of reason acting as the decisive factor in Peter's coming of age. This adaption doesn't have such a figure. Aunt May, she too, much younger than previous films, is only the preoccupied mother-figure, with only general interest in her nephew, lacking any deep emotional connection with the protagonist. Happy Hogan, the appointed supervisor, doesn't seem to care about him very much, trying to constantly avoid talking to him. Tony Stark is the closest thing Peter has to a Uncle Ben, but their relationship is troublesome. We are somehow left to believe that the only interest Stark has in him is in building a new avenger. He gives him a suit and lets him learn how to use it, without offering proper advise or moral indication as to what it means to be a superhero what so ever. The hero is left to figure his stuff out, living with the ideal of being an Avenger, but without knowing the deep implications of engaging in a heroic act. If he should succeed, then Stark got himself a new weapon. If not, then he is to be stopped from pursuing the superhero business. This situation results in some moral ambiguity. In the previous adaptations, it was easy to distinguish the bad guys from the good ones. They did the generic bad guy staff (robbed banks, murdered innocent people etc.) either having no moral compass, or being controlled by evil forces. Peter was driven by stopping them for the greater good, himself being raised by his notorious relatives with a high degree of morality. But in this movie, the only reason of Peter being a hero is to impress Stark and be part of the Avengers. This selfish drive makes him even cherish when a crime is in progress, so that he can show off his skills. The villain, Vulture, is a mafia boss running an illegal gun factory that uses stolen alien technology. Because of this, we are left to believe he is the bad guy. His most despicable act is killing a disobedient subordinate (a bad guy himself). He is an avid entrepreneur, keen on keeping his business running and his family happy. He doesn't want to destroy the world, or take over the city with his weapons. He doesn't want power, and is afraid of law, especially the Avengers. This makes him an atypical villain. He is not the selfish one here, Peter is. Producing weapons and selling them is blameworthy, but then again, this is exactly how Stark made his fortune, with the only difference that he was (probably) selling them legally. Peter can't wait to take down any guy, and uses his power only with the apparent reason of doing justice, without thinking about the consequences. Any action he involves himself in turns out really bad, with numerous peoples life put in great danger. Without his implication, an ATM would have been robbed, some weapons would have been sold, and some alien artefacts would have been stolen. Wicked things, but without any direct civilian casualties. Peter is so disastrously bad at preventing those things that Stark is forced to confiscate his suit, the principal source of his powers up to this point. The selfish Peter is now gone. Without being an Avenger at stake, he can now rejoice in his normal urban life. He even manages to overcome his timidity and asks his crush on prom. The biggest moral dilemma so far awaits him. His girlfriends father, is the Vulture. He is offered the chance to do nothing. This would result in the stealing of alien technology and the commercialization of more weapons. He chooses to implicate himself once again, this time without the help of the suit. His drive is ambiguous. Impressing Stark is out of the picture, but standing down means he is a accomplice. It's important to mention that Peter doesn't really know what Vulture is up to at the moment he decides to intervene. This would 've been a great time to emphasize Peter's morality, but we are left wondering if he chooses to action just because he sees this as the opportunity to redeem himself in the eyes of Stark, or because he simply wants to do the right thing. I believe it was the first reason that really drove Peter. When he managed to track down Vulture and find out his plan, the wisest action in his situation would be to inform Stark or the police about it. Even if the Vulture would not have been stopped in that instant, Peter knew his identity and he could easily follow him and find out where he took the stolen cargo. Alone and without his suit, he stood no chance of defeating the villain safely. He somehow decides to do the crazy thing and stop him with his bare web, knowing that it would not have been such a big deal after all, if Vulture stole those artifacts. I think he does this just to prove himself again, and ends up crashing a plane dangerously near the city. It looks good, feels fine, but they messed up the plot with an unconvincing hero.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

","Easily the best 'Spider-Man' film since Sam Raimi's 'Spider-Man 2', Jon Watts' 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' is a constantly entertaining boots on the ground story, with refreshingly small stakes and a good sense of humour. Tom Holland is great as a young Peter Parker, one that actually acts and feels like a teenager, and his performance really keeps the film webbed together. Michael Keaton also gives a fantastic performance as Adrian Toomes. While the villain is rather generic, it's Keaton's performance that makes him a memorable one. The most interesting aspects of the story are seeing Peter Parker get to grips with his powers and begin to discover more about the dangers of the world and himself. The worst aspects of the film are actually the high-flying CGI action sequences as they feel entirely synthetic. It's a shame that they decided to make almost all of the action CGI, especially considering that Tom Holland is capable of performing stunts. In fact, he actually did do the majority of stunts himself, only the studio decided to make him do these while wearing a mo-cap suit, so that they could mimic his movements onto a GCI model. I personally feel like this was a bad move and that the action would have felt more realistic if they used an actual stunt team with Holland at the forefront. Still, the great character moments outweigh the somewhat unremarkable action scenes and the film contains one of the best, most tense scenes in the entire MCU. It's a scene in which in which there is no CGI involved, just two actors and a car. 8/10",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

1156,9 May 2018,kane_1371-117-231060,6," Oh Spidey, stop it, you are killing me.
","This movie is all over the place with its cringe element, the gags are out of control, the tone is always changing, the story is trying too hard and is not really being genuine.
Another thing I picked up was that Homecoming Spiderman is the worst Spiderman ever. If he was to go toe to toe with Spiderman 1 and the amazing Spiderman 1 spidermen he would get destroyed.
Just imagine all they achieved in their first movies, and overall mastery they had on their skills compared to this one and not to mention this wasn't even his first appearance!!!
This all comes down to the way Disney execs and writers handled the character.
Peter Parker one of the strongest most intelligent heroes of Marvel universe was a slave to his suit basically (and yes it was also mentioned kind of in the story about how he was too reliant on the suit but that is basically just trying to dampen the impact of a damage already done.)
Peter Parker is a brilliant mind and here we didn't have the chance to get much of that because what we were constantly getting was the suit doing all the thinking for Peter.
Peter is dumbed down massively and that is sad.
When Peter comes in contact with Iron spider suit in the comics he at first is excited but soon realises that it is not who he is and leaves it behind for his normal suit, that alone shows how much of a different character he is to what Homecoming Peter is.
This is also very unfortunate as Tom is a great actor, he is very fun to watch and I can believe his sense of wonder and joy but the movie plot drags him down too much.
So all in all not really happy with the way the character was handled.
The story needed more work but the visuals that wins a lot of points from me, there are a few imagery easter eggs, as in shots straight out of the comic books and they are basically eye candy and just beautiful.
I expected a lot more out of this movie after all the gloating about the fact that Marvel was going to do a good spiderman movie unlike the older ones. But well I am not actually surprised.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

","I've been watching the MCU films, and I've enjoyed most of them greatly despite their (expected) flaws. Unfortunately, this one doesn't work for me, I think mostly because I'm over the age of 17.
This film is mostly a standard, formulaic high school dramedy. In one sequence, the sidekick friend announces to their entire PE class that Peter knows Spiderman. This leads to a high school party scene (like every high school party scene in every high school movie you've ever seen) and Peter struggling with whether or not he should become Spiderman to impress the girl he likes. The sidekick friend is chubby but funny, the girl is pretty and clearly into Peter, but he's too shy to go after her, the adults just don't take Peter seriously, and in the film he was mostly struggling to find his self esteem.
I came into this for a super hero movie, not a Disney Channel series following the ins and outs of a quirky teenager's life problems, and this plays like a lesson-learning episode of a standard acculturation serial, the Marvel super-hero aspect playing second fiddle throughout to the believe-in-yourself-young-middle-class-person plot.
The movie does have a few good points: I like Michael Keaton in it, Tom Holland makes a good Peter Parker even if he gets a little annoying sometimes, and it adds some (albeit shallow) depth to the MCU.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

","Spiderman: Homecoming is the first Spiderman movie in the MCU, and to be honest, I don't really have any strong opinions of what-so-ever. It's most certainly not an incompetent film, as there are plenty to like about it. I really enjoy Tom Holland as Peter Parker, and Peter himself was pretty well written, with a nice character arc. I will say that even though we already got Spiderman's introduction in Civil War, the movie felt a little empty without a proper origin story. We never saw Peter struggle with his powers, nor did we get a lot of character establishment to make him more relatable. This could be said for a lot of characters in the movie, none of them felt like they had a lot to do, apart from his best friend, the villain, and Tony Stark. Michael Keaton did a pretty good job as the villain, and while his character at least had understandable motivations, I'm still not sure how wanting to protect your family leads to becoming a thief and a murderer. The movie is fairly well directed, even though there was nothing particularly outstanding about it. I also think that the movie isn't paced very well, it was a bit too slow particularly in the first half. That being said, the second half was really enjoyable and I was very entertained. The action was good, the characters were fine, and the plot itself is nice and simple. Overall, this is just a very average, decent film, that's not special in any way. Still, I mostly enjoyed my time, and while it's not among the best movies in the MCU, it's still a good time that I don't regret subjugating myself to.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

","Okay first of all there will always be a comparison to Toby McGuire's version. Second While Tony Stark is no role model but Iron Man is a hero and Robert Downey Jr.'s Magic makes his superhero role fabulous, hopefully the Tony Stark/ Steve Rogers (Captain America) dilemma that exploded in Civil War will quickly be resolved, it is painful to see these two awesome characters fight, there is enough intelligence, creativity and diplomacy as well as good will within the Avengers to solve this problem peacefully. Tom Holland brings to the movie something special, the innocence of Spider-Man and his Amazing and refreshing optimism and it is exactly the thing that Tony Stark needs to remind him what a hero is all about and us all as well. We need peace, we need good leaders, love not war, unity and the belief in an America that stands for all that is good and just, similar to what Captain America spoke of in his films and in the Avengers. The ideals of all men created equal, justice, truth, compassion not killing, not hate is what America is about and what makes it great. Please remember also the comics code Authority to protect children from objectionable material, remember comics were made for kids yet when Marvel and DC went Mainstream they got rid of it, not cool. Bring it back, we need to protect our kids from all the grime that is circulating the world is becoming evil, dark and horrid and no we don't want that! Avengers Infinity War, please make sure that Thanos looks really cool and doesn't act doofish someone of this caliber has to have a real presence, the movie has to pull all the stops this is the big one, maybe it should be 2hours 30 minutes long, also get rid of the kitari aliens and bring a better cooler looking better alien race like the Skrulls! Finally Avengers vs. Justice League has to happen and will top 2 billion or even hit 3 billion at the theaters and the public (both camps DC and Marvel) should vote on which hero will win each contest. YEs the movie should include Darseid and Galactus and feature the Fantastic Four (which deserve another and final remake, this time do get it right. For example, you had the Torch and Thing done right in the first film, but you need a smart, serious scientist, for Mr. Fantastic with leadership qualities and beautiful but pure Sue Storm. This time Dr. Doom must wear the armor and dark green cloak, the armor is the equivalent of Iron Mans and he is a superior foe.

","Great movie! It successfully balanced drama, action, and humor. Most of the jokes, while predictable, are hilarious (especially the post-credits scene, which is too good to spoil). The action sequences, while slightly overstuffed, are excellent, and while this movie uses a ton of CGI, it is good CGI. Performance-wise, all of the actors are excellent. Tom Holland is amazing as both Peter Parker and Spider-Man, showcasing Parker as a convincing ultra-geek/nerd and Spider-Man as having slightly more confidence than Parker, but still as a hero who is still convincingly inexperienced. The Vulture/Adrian Toomes is not the greatest movie villain as a character, but Keaton's performance as Toomes is the best performance of the movie, and quite possibly of the MCU. The musical score is excellent. I only have three points of criticism: 1. Flash Thompson is a proved jerk in the movie, but he does not have enough screen time for the audience to absolutely despise him. 2. Michelle does not have enough screen time to be anything but simply there. 3. There are too many villains, and their operations are too complex to be understood in a single viewing.

","However colourful, witty and truly entertaining Spider-man Homecoming was, I felt that it was missing something vital when compared to its predecessors. Perhaps Marvel was trying too hard to make this movie different from the previous installments, but the characters felt watered down and almost boring. None of the relationships that are supposed to define Peter and help us empathize with him are there. Instead, characters like Flash, May and even his best friend are used for setting and comedic relief. Next, there was much too little context for Peter's life. I don't need a whole 30 minutes dedicated to a new take on the origin story, but without any background, this version of Peter Parker comes across as a bit bland. He's basically just a regular kid with a good moral compass. My last point is purely opinion regarding the role of Tony Stark. Yeah, he's an awesome character, but he played what was literally the biggest safety net I ever saw. Spidey's whole shtick used to be about him learning the ropes himself through trial and lots of error. Now that he has this mentor character to wipe his butt, Peter comes across as something of a whiny, reckless kid who just stumbled into his rebellious phase.

There's just one problem, they were always missing something. Spiderman: Homecoming changed that. Not only is it a great movie overall, filled with action, lots of comedy (let's not forget amazing scenes between Holland and RDJ), and even a little romance. But it finally gives fans the perfect combination of Peter Parker AND Spiderman! Tom Holland's performance is real and authentic, giving the audience a 15yo who is having the time of his life being a superhero. He fails, and makes mistakes. He doesn't know the meaning of limits and believes he can do anything as long as he has the suit. However, he is charming, and sweet, and gets nervous around girls and he LEARNS in time what it really means to be a hero! Yes, the movie has flaws, but they all do. Homecoming is beautifully done, and amazingly written. It introduces a new generation to Spiderman, the friendly neighborhood hero, in the most accurate way possible. It stays true to the comics and to who Peter Parker really is. I can't wait to see Peter's next adventure and encourage everyone to go see this movie! Definitely one of Marvel's best!

","The plot was OK. The only thing that was bad about the movie was that the powers of peter Parker were mutilated. To be more precise he is dependent on a suit for his powers whereas in the real comics they are 'within' him. I found it better to have a funny movie than a more gloomy story where the plot moves slowly. That was visible when Vulture predicted that Peter was spidey while in the car. In more typical movies its just forever. The CGI all along was good. The sequence of events was perfect. I hated that Manuel all along because he was unnecessary, bad at acting and cringe throughout. Loved Michelle, obviously Lin and iron man. In all the plot wasn't that 'bad' and the time i spent was worth it.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

In this film he was clumsy to the point of ridiculous and he didn't improve much through the film til the end. Holland is a good Spider-Man but the script held him back. The saving graces were Stark, Happy, the talking suit, Aunt Mae and of course Michael Keaton. He stole the film. No way could this Spider-Man could have gone toe to toe with Keaton's Vulture.

","Arguably one of the most anticipated films since the start of the MCU 9 years ago, this was mostly worth the wait. Tom Holland shines in the title role, bringing a new charm and vulnerability to the character that was lacking in the earlier portrayals by both Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield. The film itself is far removed in both tone and style from what we have come to expect from the other films already released in the MCU, being just as much a teen comedy as a superhero film and switching well from being mostly comedic to sometimes surprisingly dark. Michael Keaton does an excellent job bringing the Vulture to life, keeping the character eerie, yet at the core still slightly sympathetic.

Our hero is very much in training mode at this point, but the journey is fun regardless.

1228,12 July 2017,alanahsurfchick,9," Best Non-Origin Story For Spidey By Far
","Tom Holland returns as Peter Parker/Spider-Man in his first solo outing. Following the events of Captain America: Civil War, Peter returns to his everyday high school life whilst juggling his responsibilities as Spider-Man. Wanting to prove himself worthy of becoming an Avenger to his mentor, Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Peter efforts cause him to stumble onto the criminal activities of new super-villain, Vulture (Michael Keaton). Peter must now battle this new threat and, along the way, he might just show everyone that even a teenager can save the day. In my opinion, this is the best non-origin story Spider-Man film so far. Even though it a part of the MCU and makes references to previous films, this movie doesn't use what's come before as a crutch. It tells its own story and avoids being little more than a set-up film. It also twisted in ways I was unprepared for and left my jaw slacken for several minutes after the twist had actually occurred. Tom Holland does an excellent job as both Peter and Spidey. His character loves the thrill of being Spider-Man, but struggles with being regular Peter Parker. He's a fun hero but he's far from perfect, which is what makes him relatable. The supporting cast are also add a lot of flair to the film, from Peter's geeky best friend, Ned (Jacob Batalon), to Peter's caring Aunt May (Marisa Tomei). Now, there are a couple flaws, like the film hardly making any references to Spidey's spider sense power. I also wanted a few more scenes of Zendaya's character, Michelle, a quirky classmate and friend of Peter's who has a sarcastic wit that I found rather entertaining. In the end though, Spider-Man: Homecoming was a fun film with enjoyable action sequences and an entertaining cast.

1250,23 October 2017,jdr_ph,5," Raimi did it best
","Okay, I know I am an old Asian fart, but I don't care how many millennials feel about Raimi's versions. For me, Spiderman 1 and 2 are still the best and until now the scenes of those movies are very memorable. Not everything is CGI or costumes or realistic lines. For me,superhero movies should not take themselves seriously but at the same time not be a bag of jokes all the time. I really wanted to give the new versions of Spiderman some chance. I watched Amazing Spiderman and regretted it so I didn't watch the second of that supposedly trilogy. For this latest version, I was hoping against hope that the detractors were just mostly DC fans so I gave it try. Turned out to be that many Spiderman fans like felt that a lot of things were forced, especially the diversity issue (And I am Asian). I am not pro-DC or pro-Marvel. I have my favorite superheroes from each universe. This movie just shows me that Raimi really left a mark. The fact that they made the villain the father of someone close to Peter's heart felt like Spiderman 1 all over again. I get it that the new generation may want something different but for me, there is nothing wrong with sticking to one's race if the writer is white with his own point of view in the first place. As an Asian, I don't think a remake of ONCE UPON IN CHINA needs a black kung fu master, a white bald kung fu sidekick or a South American gay love interest to make it a good film that represents almost all nationalities. I am tired of the PC culture. I am not watching a political show. We cannot represent everyone in a movie. And I don't mind if the race is homogenous in a movie, especially when the era represents a certain period. Good thing that NYC is quite diverse so in this movie it is acceptable but, still, we know the hidden agenda why these different nationalities were present in this latest version of Spiderman. Just like blacks became equal citizens of 19th century French society in BEAUTY AND THE BEAST when they were actually slaves at that time. Art should not always try to be political even though some artists are political in their approach. However, there is also the art for art's sake point of view. That is why I am rewatching old films and TV series on YT nowadays because I feel that they have more to say about life in general than what I am seeing now which tends to be about the same issue about diversity and being PC.

Andrew Garfield was the best Spider Man of which he portrayed him as a controlled teenager nearly young man who's faced some problems and wears his emotions on his sleeve.

","In Spider-Man's fifth appearance on the big screen they chose a very different approach for his character and it pays off greatly. Peter Parker is a humble teenager who just can't wait to be a superhero. His conflict is that he has been deemed by his hero and mentor,r Iron Man, as merely a ""superhero in training"". Taking influences from John Hughes movies of the past, Marvel tells a teen movie as best they can. The only issue is that it is too ""super"" to truly embody the spirit of John Hughes films. Director/writer John Hughes films succeeded because he so well understood the ethos of adolescence, from teenage insecurity to high school hopes and ambitions, John Hughes had an innate sense of how teenagers ticked and how to make his teenage characters emotionally relatable. Its hard to tell a story that is emotionally relatable when its about a teenage boy who has been recruited for something so great. It may be relatable to the likes of Lebron James, who couldn't wait to be drafted to the NBA out of high school, but for most audience members Spider-Man's conflict could come off as less-relatable - or at least less emotionally significant. And therein lies the biggest issue with this movie: it seems to lack heart. Spider-Man is driven by wanting to be taken seriously, by wanting to be a real superhero. In climatic moments his emotional motivation is just to not let down his hero Tony Stark - rather than being driven by any deeper personal commitments to loved ones or any intimate personal reasons. Its a main plot that does drive character development, but its so lightweight of an emotional anchor it seems like it would work better as a subplot. In some ways this is a nice change of pace for a superhero movie, but there are some scenes in which the film tries desperately to drum up emotion and hearken to the heart of the film, and its these scenes that just feel empty and shallow. But for the rest of the film its light on its feet. It is charming and Tom Holland and his supporting cast of teenage friends are a joy to watch. My only hope is that going forward they are able to find a deeper, more relatable emotional heart for Spider-Man's story.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

","i have spent hours and hours in years past - probably hundreds, reading and re-reading the comic books of the 1980s, the golden age of marvel comics, and the golden age of spider man. Spiderman is indeed the greatest superhero of marvel comics, possibly the greatest superhero ever created. he's a proxy for the audience, a way to make a hero relatable - his life has very pronounced ups and downs, and when it's time to show courage he has it in spades. he's both awkward, but can be funny. he is insecure, more human than other superheros. this movie version delivers on the spirit of the best run of comics books. the movie includes some of the greatest moments from the comic book such as peter overcoming his helplessness and gathering all of his strength. you can tell marvel did not reboot the character just to make a buck, they took great care to craft a good story, it has the signature marvel humor which is always nice, Jon favreau is good in it, while Robert Downy Jr. makes one of his best appearances as tony stark in a sort of father figure for peter and it is quite nice. Marisa tomei makes a surprisingly great, uncharacteristically sexy aunt may. which worked very well. peter's love interest is stupidly gorgeous and she kept me enthralled whenever she was on screen. peter's sidekick is also great, and the casting for peter was quite good, he nailed peter's personality overall. the villain was very charismatic and a great performance by Michael Keaton who was recently nominated for an academy award. in fact the whole cast of actors is just perfect. the only reason i am not giving this movie better score than an eight is because i think they can really kick this into overdrive with a sequel, if they don't rush to make a trilogy. there's some social commentary that i thought it was a bit much. other than that - amazing movie, must watch.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

By sanding down a lot of the things that made him so relatable, and relegating the Peter Parker side to simply a series of things he's going to have to ditch and then say sorry to is both annoying and frustrating as someone who wants to be given any reason to care at all about the hundredth Marvel movie to be released in 15 years.

This was an average movie at best, it had some fun moments but really at the end of it I didn't really feel anything. They are going mental with these reboots, I wonder who will play the next spiderman in 3 years time. This is getting out of hand. I hope everyone simply boycotts the next movies to teach marvel/Sony a lesson.Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker was the best version of the friendly neighbourhood spiderman there was, why fix something that wasn't broken? As for this movie it was far too avengers orientated, introducing new characters, villains and sidekicks. There is no origin story here. Spiderman exists from the start so it continues from where they left of in the captain America movie. Also it seemed pretty clear that they were playing towards some diversity quota with an influx of oriental and black actors. It seemed kind of forced upon us, didn't seem natural as far as the movie goes. They were clearly aiming for the huge Chinese market to get more $$$. Marisa tomei is clearly miscast as aunt may. Holland doesn't fit his role as spiderman well either, he seems more of a pre pubescent version of the superhero. Michael Keaton does well in his villainous role. His character and his cleanup team are forced to sell alien technology weapons in order to make ends meet after being put out of work by clean up teams organised by the government. Spiderman spots them and tries to stop them, succeeds in the end. That's the movie basically. There is some comedy and romance that seemed wooden thrown in. There was no chemistry whatsoever.

When films are being made with a character over a considerable period of time, changes are to be made as per the requirements of time. But the basic things are expected to remain the same. With the recent movie, the Marvels studios have made some significant changes. First, be the Spider suit. Well, previously the suits were made by Peter Parker himself. But now it is made by Stark industries. Now the suit is suggesting Parker what to do or what not to. An unacceptable and totally unnecessary change for a spider man lover. He should be spider man because of him, not for the suit. Secondly, the never forgettable acting skills of Toby Maguire. No one really interested what spider man does with the mask because all the stunts are done with stuntman or special effects. Showing the emotions, the frustrations, require really good acting skills and were successfully done by Toby Maguire. We love him because with his acting skills he made us feel that he is one of us. Thirdly, why the first 40 to 45 minutes of the movie is made such a way is beyond any comprehension. Any Spiderman lover would like to leave the hall or turn the channel.

1342,3 July 2017,ekavalaa,7," Spider-Man: Homecoming is the best Spidey movie ever made
","IT MAY seem ridiculous, rebooting Spider-Man for the third time in 15 years but after seeing Spider-Man: Homecoming, you'll be glad they did. The Tobey Maguire Spider-Man of 2002 was fine; the Andrew Garfield Amazing Spider-Man of 2012 was also fine. The Tom Holland Spider-Man of 2017 is the best Spider-Man movie ever to grace the screen. Spider- Man: Homecoming is the perfect blend of high school dramedy and superhero antics. This is Marvel's homage to John Hughes, complete with Ferris Bueller reference. By taking it back to the school setting and ageing Spidey down to 15 years old, it recaptures some of the innocent magic gleaned in the comic pages. It also, for a movie with a flying villain and an altitude-defying superhero, grounds the story. One of the main criticisms of superhero blockbusters is that they're overblown with ever-increasing, imminent apocalypses and cities toppling over, usually in a stupidly bombastic third act. Here, the stakes are much smaller, as is the body count with Peter turning off his suit's ""kill mode"" as quickly as he realised it existed. For this Spider-Man, asking a girl to the homecoming dance is as fraught as stopping the bad guy. Our reintroduction to this iteration of Spider-Man starts with a home video Peter shot on his phone of all the behind-the-scenes action of his adventure with the Avengers. It's cheeky, fun and a clever reminder of what a big hit the character was in Captain America: Civil War and how Holland managed to steal every scene he was in from much, much bigger stars. It sets the tone for the whole movie as we join Peter at his science high school where he and his Star Wars-loving friend Ned (Jacob Batalon) aren't the most popular kids in school. Here, Peter has to worry about Spanish quizzes, winning the academic decathlon and keeping his secret identity under wraps from the classmates he saves.

1343,26 August 2017,iNathanJagger,," The smallest thing could have given it a 10
","As I have watched all Marvel movies and will continue to do so leading up to Infinity War, I had high expectations for this movie - especially as SpiderMan 4 was cancelled and The Amazing Spider-Man 3 for stupid reasons but also with stupid plots to come in the movie. So Spiderman: Homecoming was going to be a show stopper for me, and it was! The humour was unimaginably good with perfect timings and getting to know Peter and Ned and the bad guy with all their intentions and lead ups and awkward moments in the movies, with the ending being shocking up understandable. The only downside for me is that we didn't get to know his friends around him, we understood Ned and Liz but everyone else we didn't get to know like I feel like we should of, Michelle we got to know a bit about with her mind and understanding, being the one whose quietly clever and understanding smart with her sarcastic comment, but I would of mind knowing where she got that sense of humour from and what else is her link to Peter and Ned because all we know is she sat alone with no friends on the same Table as then (Happily). Now Flash, he isn't a flash - is a Flash who wants to be mean but doesn't know how to, I feel like was a weak way of putting him in the movie as they didn't know exactly what to do to him and how to make him the meanie we know him to be. We know flash as a bully who picks on Peter the most because he can and has no excuse not to, and Liz as she is the equivalent of Mary - her and Flash have no connection and no relationship, for the time they are together I don't think they spoke to each other, just was in the same conversation but with aiming their talking at each other. It seems like Flash is Flash in the movie is because Peter does what he wants and doesn't give a sh** and Flash is jealous of it and fails to be jealous on the outside and get put down like you think the school bully should but it's a movie - he should be the bully who doesn't get done. Flash was a missed opportunity in this movie and I hope he gets a backbone in the next one and I hope we learn more about his friends/group in the next movie. Now Aunt May Parker, she is the wrong actor to play with character, we know her as an old women who is on the breaking point every day but keeps with the backbone for Peter even when he lets her down, even if The Amazing Spider man was a weak excuse of a Spiderman movie she still did the part - where as this Aunt May was young hurt and seemed like she grew a bit older since Captain America: Civil War. When we saw her they were short and simple lines and at times getting hit on by some guys around, but when she was upset Peter had to say a few words to make the attention go to him crying. I feel like when she was shown it was an easy way of pumping the movie length a bit longer, except Peter crying scene, but that could have been done way better than done. I still to this day will say the original Spider man film with the classic characters and plots was the best one, but this film just shows in part what both Spider Man and The Amazing Spider Man did well, and it shocking as The Amazing Spider Man for me was a waste of money that earned money.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

","'Spider-Man Homecoming' takes place after the events of 'Captain America: Civil War' where Peter Parker is finding it difficult to settle back into his normal and everyday routine of attending School and dealing with the many responsibilities of being a teenager. Tom Hollands performance in the film is outstanding. He makes a perfect Spider-Man and easily portrays the comedic and fun loving superhero all Spider-Man fans know and love. Throughout the film we see Peter deal with a lot of different, emotional situations. There is a scene towards the end of the film which really shows the character struggling and not being sure of himself. Tom Hollands acting in these scenes is great and being part of the audience, it allows you to feel that emotion and understand what Peter Parker is dealing with. One of the main concerns that many people had about this film was the involvement of Tony Stark. Many fans were worried about the character stealing the spotlight but it's safe to say that his screen time was distributed perfectly and he was a great asset to the film. Michael Keaton's portrayal as the Vulture was great. His character had motive for what he was doing and wasn't just shoehorned in the film for the sake of it. Michael Keaton is great at portraying such serious and menacing characters and in this film it definitely payed off. The overall story ran very smoothly. All the characters were introduced really well and we continued to learn a little more about them as the film progressed. There were no boring parts in the film or certain scenes that felt like they dragged on for too long. It was great to see a Marvel Studios take on a Spider-Man film and I can't wait to see where this character ends up next.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

","Spiderman: Homecoming was a good movie, but I didn't think it was as much fun as the new Wonder Woman film that I recently watched. Although I'm more fond of Toby Maguire, I would say that Tom Holland is better that Andrew Garfield. I never like Garfield btw. His Spiderman suit also looked good in its cartoonish kind of way. Michael Keaton was a good choice for the Vulture. The Vulture suit was pretty cool and menacing. My only gripe about the Vulture is that he didn't have that much screen time. When the film starts, you get to see him for a couple minutes and about half an later, you get to seen him for another minute, etc. The part where Vulture finds out that Peter is Spiderman is when the action between Spiderman and Vulture actually starts. That's about an hour and a half into the movie. I was rather disappointed with Shocker. They only used him in a couple of brief scenes then quickly gets killed off. Then he quickly gets replaced with another one of Vulture's minions and they only used him for one brief scene. I was never that fond of Shocker, but it felt like a wasted opportunity to introduce him to the big screen. The one character I just did not like when Peter's classmate Michelle. She is the most unlikable character ever. Even more so than Flash Thompson. Every time you see her, she always makes some smart ass remark to Peter or his friend Ned. When you see her at Lizzie's party, she flips a bird at Peter when he first shows up. When Peter is in detention, she shows him a sketch she made of him being miserable with a cold look on her face. I the movie but I wouldn't call it outstanding. Out of all the movies that they made up till now.

","Wasn't sure about this entry after the trailers, but am happy with the outcome. The Good : Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-man is an absolute treat to watch. Don't think it's fair comparing his take to Tobey's or Andrew's version of the character as the universe it is set in is totally different. I do believe that all 3 actors did justice to the material that was given to them. Bearing that in mind...the material for this one was 'Good Old Fashioned Fun'so there was very little about it not to like. Michael Keaton as The Vulture...Loved every bit of it! The motivations for his villainy (though cliché'd) come out beautifully with his performance. Driven and unpredictable...I mean, what more could you ask for? If I watched this film for a 2nd time, it would be for Michael Keaton's Vulture! Now, The Not So Good : This isn't really the movie's fault, but nothing Spider-man does on film has the VOW effect on me anymore! Seeing the action in Spider- man (2002) particularly the sequence right before the end titles left me blown away and wanting more. I guess there have just been too many action sequences over the course of 7 films (and 3 franchises now) that they just come across as ""Been there, Done That!"" I am taking into account that I'm 38 years old today as opposed to 23 when the first film came out (and 5 when I saw Nicholas Hammond in the TV show) so that probably has a lot to do with my sentiment, and I probably sound stupid complaining about a movie about a guy who swings and climbs for a living when he actually swings and climbs, but maybe the filmmakers need to find a way to make the action look fresher and less generic in comparison to the previous entries. That being said...still enjoyed it to a degree The Bad - (or what I didn't like) The High Tech Suit : I tried to like it, even bearing in mind that this a next gen Spidey set in a world with Alien Invasions and whatnot, but it was lost on me! There was a point in the movie where I felt Peter didn't need his inherent Spidey Powers because the suit seemed to be doing all the work. Betty Brant could have been in that suit and it would have done something. What I love most about Peter Parker in the comics is his limited resources yet genius intellect which brings me to my second point :- From whatever angle you look at it, Shared Universe or not - Avenger or not, Spider-man is the Crown Jewel of the Marvel Universe. It does not feel good as a fan to see him upstaged in his own film! All due respect to Marvel and what they've done with Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man, but the whole mentor thing took away a bit of zing from the experience. If I remember correctly, there is an arc in the comic where Peter Parker hacks in to the Stark Industries main frame thereby getting recruited as an Avenger, not the other way round where he is chasing them like a lost lamb. Sigh of relief when Peter declines the offer in the end! Still....A Enjoyable Experience where the Good very much outweighs the Bad. Look forward to a lot more Spidey (stand alone) with a little less Avenger!",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

Spiderman does not need all of the tech that Iron Man needs etc. I am so angry with the writers for basically taking away what Spiderman is, he does not need all of this high tech to be Spiderman. The basic story behind Spiderman is that he is a kid in a suit and that his powers are enough to make him Amazing(kind of where the whole ""Amazing Spiderman"" thing comes into play). I do not want to step all over this film because it happens to be a decent film. It could have been an absolutely amazing film if they were to 1) Get rid of the unnecessary technology suit. 2) Do not let Tony Stark control Peter like he is a little kid.

There's a suit, there's a non-threatening ai who helps the user of the suit. But what makes spiderman special exactly? Tony Stark may not have super powers but at least he has the intelligence to make the damn iron man suit. I guess it brings up another avenue of story telling when he's given his power by another person but it just doesn't have the same gravity to me because this is something that can be easily taken away and then you're left asking why couldn't it be anyone in that suit. Maybe they were just sick of telling the same story for the 3rd time. I had a similar feeling when the newest hulk showed up in avengers.

","It's a good watch, if you aren't much into comics and the shows you will definitely enjoy the movie to some extent but if you really know who Spidey is then you will HATE most parts of the movie. First of all Spiderman never really relied on tech, In SMH we see peter doing all those great things because of his suit, the suit literally tells him what to do, when to sit when to talk and when to kiss like really! This isn't an iron man movie, I know times are changing and everything's gotta adapt that way but whoa really? You might as well give him an iron man suit while you're at it. Spiderman purely relied on his own abilities, we have seen him fight with his suit ripped to shreds and THAT makes him awesome. The Spidey sense is GONE! That's like Thor without his hammer. Also the driving force of what makes spiderman ""Spiderman"" is uncle Ben, his vision to be a man like him in his own way, not some wannabe superhero trying to impress Iron man. Also spiderman is not DUMB he can hack his own suit, look through enemy's strategy and stuff with ease as opposed to in the movie. The cast was horrible, Flash is an average Indian dude playing quiz with the 5-6 people we see, he's pretty likable which is NOT supposed to happen with flash, Spidey's best friend is a fat Asian, the girl calling herself MJ is not really relevant until she calls herself that, the movie tries hard to stuff diversity in our faces, nothing wrong at all with this cast IF you are making any other movie but if you're gonna cast a black dude for superman or a white dude for black panther or cyborg then you're doing it wrong mate! The movie has some really bad logic, like the chitauri core doesn't seem harmful until the suit tells peter it's harmful, it's understandable after the x-ray machine but even before that it starts to act weird when it was pretty harmless all the time peter held it everywhere. The Washington monument is damaged and no one gives a f*ck why it happened no investigation nothing, if that happened the fat harry and peter would've been in custody for pretty long. Also the core which was starting to turn into a small sun, burning sheets and making the bag glow doesn't harm fat harry at all!

","Spider-Man Homecoming tells the coming of age tale Peter Parker as he struggles to balance school, family, and being a superhero and that's what it should be. This film brings Spider-Man back to his charm as what made Spidey so relatable was that he was not a larger than life superhero but one of us. Tom Holland does a phenomenal job portraying Peter Parker/ Spider-Man with his youthful charm, and infectious charisma, as does everybody else. One stand out in particular being Michael Keaton as the Vulture. Having significantly more depth than your standard MCU villain Michael Keaton delivers a joyfully over the top performance with a surprising amount of depth. However although this film does have a lot to love about there are still many flaws that may make it a disappointment for some viewers, one big one being that the film has no weight to it. Everything from the emotion to the action feels without any stakes and frankly just underwhelming. Where as every Spider-Man movie from this point had pretty exceptional action scenes (including The Amazing Spider-Man 2) this one included several jump cuts and no impact. There are also a few minor issues with the film, without getting into spoiler territory there was one scene in particular that was very clearly an advertisement for an Audi. Overall although I would still say Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 1 and 2 are still better this is undeniably a very fun enjoyable summer flick. As far as Marvel movies go I'd say this one's pretty great.

","My expectations were low going in. I wasn't as fan of the Raimi installments but was warming up to the Amazing Spiderman movies that were discontinued. A real shame as in those we actually got the spiderman in suit as portrayed in the comics. And more importantly; not so much a nerdy but a more smart-ass Peter Parker. So now there is this movie. So how was it? Pretty decent and fun actually!
Peter here is a young kid grounded in this modern day and age. The movie plays more like a teen coming-of-age movie than let's say the latest Marvel Avengers entry. We see high school (prom) insecurities being played up, a wing man for comic relief, being unpopular while having a crush an the popular girl of the class.

The acting is top notch. Holland plays it pretty straight as a quirky hyper kid full of ambitions. The jokes land just right, most of the time. I do feel Keaton was severely underused in the movie, but hey he is the villain.

","As a teenager watching this film, it was kind of surreal. I know that the demographic for this movie was within my age group, and generally the consensus on this film was that it was good. Personally, I didn't like the film, because I think it lacked something. I understand that this was just meant to be a fun film, with no consequences, but I think the emotional depth that could've been developed I little bit more. For example, I got a bit frustrated when Peter's friend automatically forgave him after he ditched him at a party, a place he was obviously not comfortable with. I would've liked to see a little bit of conflict in that area. I appreciate the school setting, as I understand that that's what fans have been asking for for a long time, but sometimes it just felt like a drag and that it was prolonging the movie. A lot of parts could've been cut out. The comedic aspect of the film hit the mark in some places, like when he dropped the death star Lego set after seeing peter, shock horror. Other jokes were a little bit...eh. Like the porn joke, but I digress, jokes are jokes and are meant to be laughed at and not criticized.

1413,1 October 2017,tawe4,7," Good movie but....(contains some spoilers)
","First of all, this was a good movie. Tom Holland did a great job of playing a younger Spider-Man. He played the young Peter Parker who has a crush on a pretty young girl Liz (Laura Harrier) and has a hard time talking to her. Michal Keaton did a great job as the vulture, even though it was different than the comic book version. Jacob Batalon as Ned was great and funny. Marisa Tomei did a great job playing a younger version of Aunt May (Even if no One called her Aunt May). Zendaya played the role of Michelle very good and she add some much needed dry humor into the movie. Overall, the cast did great job in there roles. Now, here is the down side. I am a traditional comic book fan. I'm not into this whole social justice garbage that movies and T.V. are pushing on everyone. Tony Revolori who played Flash did do an good version of the character, but Flash is supposed to be an athlete/jock and not a smart kid. I know that times have changed but when it comes to being bullied by someone that is smaller than the main character...well, that's not believable at all. He did a good job for the character they wrote for him but it was so annoying that he was picking on someone who was bigger than him, it didn't make sense. Now, the red button topic, Zendaya possibly playing Mary Jane Watson. I read several articles that said she wasn't playing Mary Jane Watson and Zendaya even said that she wasn't playing the iconic role of Mary Jane Watson (MJ). I don't know if Marvel can't use Mary Jane Watson character or they are just going to do an alternate version of her. I wouldn't be too fond of them from changing Mary Jane Watson from her original correct version of (yes I am going to say it, brace yourself) Red Head White girl instead of being a social justice warrior to change the race of an iconic character to a (brace yourself) black girl. I know I will get the SJW calling me a racist and that I don't know comics. I'm not a racist, I do know my comics, & I don't care what you think. If you get this far, here is what I think Marvel & Sony will be doing. I think they are setting up a Miles Morales story line. Now that would be great. Miles Morales needs to be brought into the MCU and I really think that this version of Spider-Man will be leading to it. Anyway, it was good movie & I believe most people enjoyed it. I did like it (Would have loved for Sony to finish the 3rd Amazing Spider-Man).",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

","In principle, it is clear that this film was made for a teenage audience. Here, the heroes were rejuvenated (compared to Maguire and Garfield, Holland is a kid at all), and the humor became very teenage. I have watched, and more than once, all versions of films about the super hero spider-Man. From my point of view, this version is the most successful. Firstly, the special effects are at an overhanging level, the costumes are also very cool. I want to note that Tom Holland was ideally suited for this role, if we take into account the previous parts, then in the first, the spider was very snotty, in the second reboot of the film, on the contrary, very ""twitchy"".

","Going into the cinema, I was worried that it was going to be another Spider-Man origin story- it pleasantly surprised me- in fact it was more of a film about a young boy who has a crush on a girl and who goes to a high school, but- on the side- he is Spider-Man. Tom Holland takes on the role from Andrew Garfield, who took on the role from Tobey Maguire, neither of whom were particularly believable Spideys, as they were way too old to be a fourteen year old, but Tom Holland is a believable Peter Parker. You could believe that he was a fourteen year old. He tackled the role fantastically- despite his accent being British- he did the American voice very believably. He also did his own stunts something that many of Hollywood's A List actors are too afraid to do in current times. Another fantastic performance was from Zendaya, when I watched the film I presumed that Ned was meant to be the comic relief, but, for me and the other people in the cinema she was, with her quotes on her having no friends, drawing people in misery and how the Washington Monument was built by slaves- this comment is laughed off by her decalathon teacher who looked toward a guard of the monument, who did pull a face which meant ""She is right!"". The guy who brought together the plot was Michael Keaton, some people hailed his performance in this film, whereas I came out of the cinema thinking it was very average- it was not a villain that I would remember like Loki, Red Skull or Ultron. Although I did think that the twist in which Peter went to the door to pick up Liz and the man who answered was Michael Keaton, Liz's father was very good. I liked the touch with Captain America being the PE teacher's back up for a teacher, the PE Teacher made the nice touch of saying that ""I think he is a war criminal"", also the end credit scene got a giggle- I am not sure it was worth the ten minute wait. In reflection, It was a good film, the best Marvel flick since Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1, it had it's flaws, the fight scenes were too long and there should have been more of Donald Glover, the could've tied him in with the whole of the rest of the MCU- I was disappointed, also I liked Happy in other films- but I found him annoying in this film- he wasn't the usual Happy.

I like how they really just made a new spiderman by using some stuff from Miles Morales that works so well with Tom's. And I am glade to see Peter Parker that looks like a teen, Tobey looked like he was 20 in his first film but after that when he was an adult it was fine then, Andrew where he was 20 and looked to cool to be a geek like Peter, wear Tom has that middle ground were he looks a bite younger not 15 maybe 17 but his voice and acting and the writing really seals you on Tom's Peter being younger and more believable. That other cast is pretty great too they have a nice dynamic with Peter that feels how people would act in a high school or even middle school. The villain Vulture is great one of my favorite mcu and spiderman villains because he not a villain who wants to destroy the world, no he is an average guy who wants to help his family and he cares about them too. I like the acting all around Tom like I said really makes you believe that he is young inexperience and looks out for the little guy Ned his friend is a good side character for Peter to bonce off of you feel that they are friends and don't have a lot other once's too, and that there geeks that don't get bullied but get picked on, and I like how Tony gets a little bite of screen time and is like a father figure to Peter and makes Peter want to make Tony proud of him.

","Many will say Marvel have hit the mark once again and in some ways they have. This movie most likely will appeal to many and especially to the younger Marvel universe fans. Unfortunately for myself I just found Mark Holland's Spider-Man annoying, which was a disappointment because he nailed Spider-Man in the Avengers. Too be fair Mark's acting has little to do with the character being annoying. I guess I found Spider-Man's witty banter to miss the mark and the way Jon Watts chose to film the movie from the view of a mobile phone, fell flat for me. Still an ok movie it has a solid storyline and some greats action scenes, Robert Downey Jr is great as Tony Stark yet again but I think for my liking Mark Holland's Spiderman really needs the whole team behind him to make his witty remarks work other wise it just becomes too much. As a stand alone character he is one of my least favourite Spider-Mans. Sorry",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

",Tom Holland was more funnier than any other Spider-Man and Michael Keaton was perfect villian of this story. Honestly Tom Holland is perfect Spider-Man for marvel.,/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017
1438,17 February 2018,henrivallee,6," Surprisingly good
","Spiderman: Homecoming was actually good, I really didn't want to see this film because I was starting to get tired of super-hero films especially marvel movies, apart from the guardians of the galaxy movies they all feel the same, I got tired of the avengers or captain America, but my friends obligied me to see it and I liked it.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

","Well, Spiderman 3 had a rough send off in 2007, and a low scored reboot in 2012. Marvel picking up the guy didn't do him no harm. It gave him little more charisma, and made a good, light movie, that I surely enjoyed.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

","I'm not a big marvel fan,but I'm going to say this movie is amazing. Strong cast(Aunt May is so sexy!)、wonderful storyboard and aspiring morality,no doubt the movie is highly recommended. But I think the personalities of spider-man is not that accurate. When it comes to Spider-man series,what came in to my mind was Tobey Maguire in 2002'spider-man movie,his performance is perfect.I don't think spider-man is a handsome guy or just virtually a nerd.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017

","Overall, I really did enjoy the film, getting it right off of my chest – The orchestrated Spider-Man theme at the beginning was epic! I had a huge smile on my face as it took me back to my childhood of watching the cartoon and got me in great mood before the film got started.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017
1443,26 July 2017,moonriverwaltzing,7," Good but flawed
","It is well made and shot! All the action scenes were gripping, especially the elevator scene. I like how Peter Parker is portrayed as an excited, bubbly dorkish character but I remember he's a total genius too (which he isn't in the movie?). Great side character choices though. The major hole in the movie (and what I had been really looking forward to watching) is his origin story. How he was bitten, how he adjusted to his powers, etc. People might say they've seen that already, and I understand their point of view, but for me, the way he became Spiderman is the most important part of his story. Also, he's more dependent on gadgets? His suit was damn cool! I totally enjoyed his mishaps with his suit and I would love to see more of it too. But I was expecting something that would give him that edge...traits and powers that are unique to Spiderman. His body was changed by a spider bite but he got only super-strength and that's kinda plain. Other than that, it's a fun watch.",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017
1444,24 September 2017,grarestephane,7," Another version...
","Spider-Man: Homecoming or Spider-Man: The Homecoming in Quebec is an American superhero film directed by Jon Watts, released in 2017. Produced by Marvel Studios and Columbia Pictures, it is distributed by Sony Pictures Entertainment. This is the sixteenth film of the universe Marvel and the fourth in Phase 3. For my part, this is a version too, an extra version of Spider-Man. I love this character, but in a few years we had our lot. The actor has signed for 5 films. Civil War, Homecoming, Avengers 3 and 4 and Homecoming 2 (but still not for Homecoming 3). I hope that we will not have yet another version of Spider-Man in the years to come ...",/review/rw3813393/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_Homecoming_2017
