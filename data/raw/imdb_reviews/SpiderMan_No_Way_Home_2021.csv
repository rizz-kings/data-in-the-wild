","This Spiderman is really fantastic. It captivated me right from the start, and I was entranced every second. There's adventure, friendship, team spirit, love, empathy, and brotherhood. The people in the cinema clapped and cheered multiple times, at the appearance of key characters and at big hint of what the future holds for Spiderman.

3,19 March 2022,Neptune165,5," I consider myself to be a big fan of Marvel and definitely of Spider-Man, but something wasn't right about this film
","Awful movie. The plot sucked and had awful pacing humour, and dialogue were subpar(like the octopus joke). And they couldn't think of anything better so they brought back some old characters which still didn't save this poorly written film. One bad dialogue scene was when the 3 Spider-Men where making jokes about Tobey's organic webs which was just awkward and humorless. And to add to that, Tobey saying that ""my back"" joke and Norman Osborn repeating ""I'm something of a scientist myself"". Just why?! The film could never decide whether it's a comedy or a dark action movie.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

","This is a movie made purely to satisfy the fans and there should be no doubt about that. No Way Home, in my opinion, is even better than Homecoming and Far From Home, and pretty much one of the best MCU movies of all time. It's a simple story, but the execution is fantastic. Even the smallest of surprises have a huge impact, and I could feel that in the theatre as I joined several other Spider-Man fans cheer out for both heroes and villains. The action sequences were brilliant; seeing them in 3D is totally worth the price of admission. Every actor delivered a believable, realistic performance, and especially our lead actor Tom Holland. The visual effects too were top notch and the editing was stupendous. Two and a half hours flew by real quick while watching this popcorn action entertainer. It won't be fair to reveal anything, so here I conclude my review, and recommend you to check out this new world of Spidey-ness on the big screen and in 3D.

","I was already concerned about Spider-Man: No Way Home when I walked into the theater (one could say I was expecting to be disappointed.) I kind of hate the idea of delving too deep into a multiverse, because I think it muddles things too much, and defies the internal logic of most stories. Sure enough that was something I felt while watching this film. This movie cannot hold up to even the tiniest bit of analysis, because it creates plot holes that you can drive a freight train through. It's kind of sad because there were some moments in the movie that I genuinely loved, but all I can think about days later are the myriad of questions that I'm left with because this movie created so many situations that make no sense.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

The beginning climb is a little slow, but it's an exhilarating ride once things get swinging.

25,20 December 2021,mhorg2018,6," A good, not great movie.
","This is the best film Marvel has released this year. Shang-Chi was only ok, the Venom sequel was atrocious, Black Widow was so-so, Eternals was bland for the most part. What makes this one work is the cast, but the story really, when examined is weak. The last movie put the writers in a corner while revealing (a silly idea really) Peter's identity to the world. He goes to Doctor Strange without thinking about what he really wants, and ends up, in typical spider-man fashion, in screwing everything up. So, also in usual Spider-Man style, by trying to fix things up, he totally messes up further. In the end this costs him a lot. While this movie starts out well, the middle is dull and why should Peter care about beings from alternate realities? And by 'fixing' them, did he erase the events of those films, making the spider-men of those realities unnecessary? Peter loses everything due to his listening to Aunt May, who's advice is illogical and gets her killed. Well, I can say this was the best of Holland's trilogy, but it still isn't Spider-Man 2. A few sides: Molina, Garfield and Maguire's returns were the best part of this movie. Those three steal every single scene they're in. Dafoe was good as Norman, but I could have done without Electro and Sandman who added little to the story. While others are falling over themselves gushing over this, I think I may be suffering from Superhero fatigue.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

","It has some minor flaws here and there- but Spider-Man No Way Home is easily the best Spider-Man film to date- successfully capturing the energy and spirit of the franchises past with an entirely new direction. One of the few things I noticed while watching this film is how intimate it was with the audience. More than ever we begin to see things from Peter's point of view, and it sculpts a very touching and emotional narrative that is easily the best execution in a Marvel property in a while. While there are some small things I think they could have touched up a bit better, this film was massively entertaining, incredibly funny, and surprisingly very emotional in the best way possible. It blends the past characters so well into its story you hardly feel it's their first time in the universe. Even more, it's such a unique experience to finally see 3 generations of superhero fans unite for such an epic opportunity- of which seems more than well done- almost too good to be true at times. It may not be perfect, but personally- I loved nearly every minute of it, and can't wait to see what this franchise continues to offer down the road.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

","I just watched the movie at the theatre and you really don't wanna miss this one out. I will make it simple, the movie will live to your expectations If not exceed them, however, during the first half of the film you won't witness anything new. Every fight scene is in the trailer and I LITREALLY mean every fight scene. But don't get me wrong they were awesome and of course not the whole fight scenes. It's also full of talking and a bit more funny lines than usual. You also have a very very silly plot that was based on some character's opinion and lead to all the events of the film and then comes on of the best plots and entrances near the beginning of the second half that you will ever witness and here comes the second half of the movie and trust me it was beyond awesome. The VFX of this film is breathtaking. Every action sequence is very complicated and loaded with tons of details. The visuals are insaaane. You also have a couple of Spidy suits and most importantly you won't be disappointed with anything you might be expecting. You have Dr. Strange and believe me it was one of the best times you will see him along with another hero cause Benedict is such a great actor. Zendaya role however was meaningless but you know she is Spidy's GF. The Finale of the film is beyond great and feels like a dream come true for all fans around the world that will leave you full of emotions, amazed and shocked! Even the two post credit scenes made everyone yell in the theatre (who yelled for more than half of the movie). Not a perfect movie and a lot of things may not make sense and will make your brain full of questions like Endgame and that's what make a movie a great one. I have now experienced the whole trilogy at the theatre and there is no doubt that this one is the best. I hope you just relax and enjoy it cause as a fan I'd give it a 10/10 easily but a solid 9/10 with love and joy is fair enough.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

","Tobey Maguire's trilogy remains indelible, from its origin story, the pitch-perfect sequel, and the messy conclusion. It has Raimi written all over it, and even at its worst moments, the least you could dub it is memorable. The follow-up series doesn't have that same appeal, but Garfield's charisma shines through, as it similarly does here. Conversely, Holland's rendition has always felt a little cut-and-paste from its surrounding universe, unable to separate itself from the whimsy and bathos of the MCU. This Peter Parker's one-liners are drawn from the same snarky persona as Iron Man, Star-Lord, War Machine, Doctor Strange, Ant-Man...the list goes on. I've made my peace with it. It isn't a new criticism, and could be levelled at most films post-Phase One. But it's always felt limiting in terms of crafting distinct character (and filmic) voices and undermining attempts at sentimentality. Let's start with Cumberbatch's Strange. He's stepping into the mentor role post-Endgame but he's never been given a meaningful opportunity to develop his own philosophy on the character, let alone a voice. Sans his solo film, the premise of the Sorcerer Supreme makes him a convenient plot device to facilitate the adventures of other superheroes. Listen to his dialogue here; it's always delivered at a distance, drenched in cynicism, as if it's afraid of fully buying into the idea of a connection. Cumberbatch seems to be constantly setting up the next punchline, and so even if this abrasive back-and-forth elicits laughs, it never builds to anything genuine, rendering the climatic callback (obvious from a mile away) into a deflated attempt at growth and recognition. Yes, RDJ addressed Holland in the same way, but there was history and a relationship there. There's an inherent self-consciousness to the way that Feige and co. Craft the MCU's humour, so relentlessly wary of losing the audience for more than a second that they keep sincerity at an arm's length. Observe how the entire film just grinds to a halt for the Spidey's stand-up routine atop the Statue of Liberty scaffolding; the trialogue isn't written for the characters, it's written for the fans to play spot the reference (""You're amazing. I want to hear you say it.""). Marvel would never in a million years allow their Spider-Man to be the butt of the joke, or freeze-frame on his goofy smile over 'Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head'.

","""No Way Home"" is an ambitious project that tries to unite Spider-Man fans of different generations and I have appreciated this effort. I am not against fan-service movies, as long as the plot is interesting and well developed. It is a film that overwelcome its staying, with a length of almost two hours and a half. I had to split the viewing on two different days, because I was getting really bored. There are tons of scenes that needed to be cut, as some plot points are completely useless. The premises are ridiculous: basically all the mess happening in the film is due to some Peter's whim. Therefore all the fights that we see against the villains were perfectly avoidable, if only Doctor Strange was a bit more responsible and would just clarify with Parker his intentions, before executing the spell. It baffles me that such a powerful sorcerer commits these mistakes, it does not make any sense.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

","Wow what a ride and such an experience. As a big Spider-Man fan I got a surprising few things from this movie too. First of all they stuck with the villains stories no matter the reception they got on the previous films they stuck with it and that's honestly so respectful. To see not all of them actually be villains because Peter is trying to help them from themselves by not dying was the Spider-Man I have been hoping to see from Tom Holland which I didn't feel in the other movies. Green Goblin is easily the most terrifying how he pretends to be on Peters side and tries to manipulate Peter and May. Lizard wasn't in it much but hey he was still good in the movie. Sandman was awesome, he protected Peter from Electro after the events of Spider-Man 3 and just wanted to be with his daughter. Electro was fun and fresh too with his new look and the visuals. Doc Ock obviously amazing and to hear the call backs to Spider-Man 2, so happy they didn't make him a villain and he actually helped them. Second of all Aunt May being Peters ""Uncle Ben"" was amazing, she delivered the line perfectly and she was just great especially since we had more screen time with her in these movies than we did with Ben in the others. Thirdly Matt Murdock! Are you kidding me! A very small part but wow it's good to see him again looking great and I can't wait to see what they do with that character. Fourthly Andrew and Tobey of course... Andrew coming through that portal and being not quite sure if it was him until he came forward was unreal everyone went mad in the cinema (Same with Tobey) he is still great after years, Tobey amazing too they just hold a special place in a lot of peoples hearts and their interactions with the characters especially Peter (Toms) Just very impactful and maybe they will come back who knows. 5th point is that in the portal coming through we saw Kraven and a Rhino variant and I wanted them to come but who knows... overall they ended the film great with the villains not having to die. Final points I'll say is that Green Goblin vs Peter was pretty brutal, it was intense and Tobey stopping Peter from killing him was just so perfect. My last final point is that ending... Peter having to leave everything behind to keep them safe was the Spider-Man we all know and love. Him getting an apartment struggling to get by and being Spider-Man still with a comic accurate suit and not an iron spider suit. This is the Spider-Man I have wanted and I can't wait to see what they will do. The ending made me think of the game for the PS4/5 and if they go down that route of tone and stuff then this could be some of the best Spider-Man movies coming up. No gadgets, just Spider-Man and Peter Parker being their natural selves and the heroes we all love. Overall this film is something else and I'm glad I was there to see it, it's a good laugh, it's a good thrill and it's Spider-Man. Thank you to everyone who made this film!",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

I would say my review might be a lot partial, I have watched this movie 5 times in theatres in every format available. The movie is everything everyone wanted. Jon Watts 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 you really outdid yourself from the prequels. Let's start with the main crew. Tom Holland, I haven't been a big fan of his spider-man since his take felt a bit childish in the previous movies, but I gotta change my opinion now since, man he felt like a real Peter Parker this time. The Peter Parker known to make sacrifices for the greater good, he was perfect, from the initial childish role to maturing by the end of the movie, it felt unreal. Zendaya, she is just perfect, the best MJ - Michelle Jones that is, but his and Tom's chemistry is perfect, they are made for each other and so are their characters. Ned played a perfect supporting role. And the villains, nobody is better than Willem Dafoe. I guess they all redeemed themselves in a way. Especially Electro, ""I thought you were black"".

However, No Way Home trips over something, that isn't its own fault:

Oh well, what you saw at the end of the most recent Thor film does not indicate that, but the final sequence with Tom Hardy here is not as much of an introduction to a fourth Spider-Man film, so it will maybe stay at three. The music you heard with the closing credits was also fairly fitting from this perspective. Of course, it is also a great connection to the three Spideys from this film here, but I will get to that a little later. Let's look at the basics first: The director is Jon Watts and he was also in charge of the previous two Spider-Man movies. Same is true for the two writers. It is not a surprise that they got chosen too for this one, but the real surprise was maybe that they got picked for the first film five years ago maybe as they were not really famous. Then again, these Marvel films rarely go for the truly defining filmmakers of our generation, but get in some new blood instead most of the time. Just like this trilogy here. The director worked on several Fatboy Slim music videos in the past and the two writers McKenna and Sommers collaborated on American Dad, which is both pretty cool. As for the cast, you will find a handful names from the previous films, obviously Tom Holland in the lead and also Zendaya who is really cruising right now with her roles here and in Dune. Jacob Batalon looks much more manly in real than in this film where he plays a nerdy character. Benedict Cumberbatch as Stephen Strange is really in every Marvel movie these days, which shows how popular he is. Benedict Wong I definitely appreciate here too as always. I like his character a lot, but sadly he does not have a lot of screen time here. Marisa Tomei is also back and she plays the youngest Aunt May you will probably ever come across. Still interesting that she is the only Oscar winner from the original cast here. They brought in another one with an Academy Award, but more about him in a second.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

While in Homecoming and Far From Home, Peter Parker's character felt quite childish, this film would show the transititon of a more grown-up Peter Parker, and Tom Holland did really well for making it happen. Of course No Way Home has many surprises that I won't spoil, but don't expect too much on storyline. The plot is pretty simple actually, and the trailer had already shown almost all the plot.

","I'm no fan of the SPIDER-MAN films with Tom Holland; I find them way too kiddified and the humour just jars with me. But I can comfortably say that this is the best of the trilogy, and that's because it feels fresher and different to the rest. I loved the recall of old villains, it was great to see Foxx, Molina and Dafoe come back again and it's clear they're having fun. Cumberbatch is good in a limited role too. Best of all are Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire, who light up the screen and make all of their scenes delightful; they show up Holland, that's for sure.

162,17 December 2021,tarynabryant,1," Underwhelming, Relies too Much on Nostalgia
","As a huge Doctor Strange fan who is more than ready for more of the multiverse, I had very high expectations for No Way Home. Unfortunately, it was a let down. Sure it caters to fans with some nostalgic moments, but relies way way way too much on the fan service while lacking in pretty much all other areas. The story was all over the place, pacing was very wishy-washy, and the writing was horrendous for the most part. It felt very childish and cheap at a lot of moments with jokes that just did not land at all and some super corny dialogue. My best friend and I were genuinely confused at the amount of laughs, cheers, and claps from our audience in the theater tonight (and we are both very big Marvel fans, my best friend being a long-time, devoted spidey fan). So believe me when I tell you that we really wanted to love this movie. Honestly our favorite part of the entire film was the post-credits features. If anything, this movie only further solidified my belief that Tom Holland is the weakest of the Spider-Mans. Not necessarily his fault, but rather the fault of the writers for trying way too hard to make him a quirky, shy, stuttery, awkward teenager and not giving him any real development or depth to his character aside from maybe the two seconds after May's death and his fight with Osborn where we see a glimpse of a dark side in him, but that's it. Additionally, killing off May was just so lame. It reeked of ""we need to kill off a character for some kind of shock value but not anyone too important"". Another moment that I don't understand is when Toby is seemingly fatally injured in a sudden and surprising moment towards the end of the film, but then is all of a sudden okay a few minutes later? There were just too many moments that felt like it was relying on audience reactions and surprise in order to come across as a good movie. I think the main reason it is receiving such praise right now is because of the current hype around Andrew and Toby reprising their roles (which was great fun don't get me wrong), but in the long run didn't feel like it served much of a purpose to the actual story beyond wanting to drop a bombshell on fans. By the fifth conversation/conflict about how Peter can ""cure"" the villains and save the world, the entire movie became a jumbled and chaotic mess. Interesting concept but executed poorly.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

Really, the reality where we see these characters together is unthinkable, yet here we have it, and the film ensures its more than fan service! Spiderman, choosing to 'cure' gives these characters a shot at the main theme of the film, redemption. This brings us to the grandest (& most spoiled) reveal in recent years, the appearance of the other Spidermen! It is difficult to comprehend and put into words the feeling of seeing Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield suit up. Filmmakers even graces its fans by showing PLENTY of these Parkers as they play huge roles in the third act, complimenting the emotional themes of the film. In fact, my favorite redemption story arch was that of Andrew's. I was blown away by how invested he was. When he caught Zendaya's MJ, his outpour of raw emotions sent shivers down my spine. It was gratifying to see the filmmakers give him justice. Another positive is we finally have a mature version of Tom Holland's Spidey.

","Not only is this one of the best MCU films, its debatably the best Spider-Man film. It no doubt feels like a love letter to how far the Spider-Man films have come. This film wouldn't have been possible if it wasn't for many things like the MCU setting up their own Spidey and Doctor Strange as well as everything that happened in all the previous Spider-Man films. It's fan service but the fan service has purpose to be there. But underneath all the fun callbacks it's still a damn good Spider-Man story. Tom Holland to me is the best live action Spider-Man we've had so far and he's come such a long way. From taking orders from Tony Stark in Civil War to now giving the orders to two other Spider-Men really is an achievement for him. The movie even fixes things many have had problems with. Not just for him but for other things too like how much of William Dafoe's performance as the Green Goblin we missed when he had to wear that helmet in the first Raimi Spider-Man movie. There's so many incredible moments in this movie id never thought id see one day. From Spider-Man defeating Doctor Strange with math to Aunt May's tragic death to watching all three Spider-Men swing together and do science was such a treat. It has almost everything I could want in a Spider-Man flick.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

Then of course there is baiting for other upcoming MCU movies. Even the fun jokey jokey scenes that are the hallmark of this franchise get cringe-worthy sometimes. I still give this movie a thumbs up, because it took a concept and found some fun with it. There is a little bit of manipulation, with more than a few tear jerker scenes (really? How many times do you need to push the waterworks?). But the biggest thing this movie has going for it is re-thinking the villains.

281,17 December 2021,Dello_,5," Great experience but do not look too much into it...
","On the surface Spider-Man: No Way Home is highly entertaining, funny and with some heartfelt moments and all contributes to a satisfying view. It is great too see again some old villains and in general there is a lot of fan service but is done well and it's not annoying. The movie is also able to trigger people reactions and if you watch this movie in a passionate theatre the experience will be great because you can hear the sounds of the people around you, and it was something that I didn't experience since the pandemic has started and it was nice. You'll probably walk out from the viewing with very positive vibes and with high levels of satisfaction. BUT if you start think about it with a more critical view the magic will vanish because nothing makes sense. The premise is so stupid and the movie happens because Peter had suddenly become retarded, and not only him. Things happen because we will never know (like the reason for the return of the villains, the movie tries to give an explanation but in reality doesn't). And realistically what is the probability that between an infinite number of universes could happen exactly what has happened in the movie? How fortunate we were! And also the finale (that is very very satisfying and emotional) comes from a sudden change of the rules established previously in the movie. And so you can see that everything is only a pretext to please fans but without a real structure or a good premise behind it. The plot is useful only for the fan service. And if on one hand it is what has made my watching an experience, it is something that has to be noted. And so I am divided between my fan nature that has liked this movie and my rational and objective nature that dislikes it because of the nonsense of the plot. And so in conclusion what I can say is: go watch it for the experience without expecting a good movie, only a collection of cool scenes.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

","Spider-man has been my all-time favorite superhero since I was a kid; to be more precise, Tobey Maguire was the only real spider-man for me and I was never able to even have the slightest interest for Andrew Garfield's spider-man. I remember wearing his suit when I was five or six years old after watching the Sam Raimi's trilogy for the 100th time and pretending that I was the friendly neighborhood spider-man. Who knows, maybe my passion for science came from these movies, cause you know, I'm something of a scientist myself. All these memories came rushing back to me after I heard the rumors about the possibility of multiverse in the new movie. I did not care if they would vitiate my good memories because of an awful storyline, all I needed was to see Tobey wearing his unique costume one more time. The moment he walked into the scene for the first time after fourteen years, the lyrics from ""No leaf clover"" by Metallica came to my mind: ""Good day to be alive Sir!"".",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

","I enjoyed this the third and to date most recent Spider-Man movie starring Tom Holland more than I had its predecessors. I would attribute this to a number of factors, firstly and most importantly the storyline is a lot more adult than in the two previous movies. Secondly I dug the presence of Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange character, having recently watched and enjoyed the two movies bearing his name above the title (this crossover stuff is all a bit tricky sometimes!). Thirdly and best of all were the surprise appearances of both previous Spider-Men, Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield. I love all that multi-verse time and space stuff and even while I recognised it straight away as a plot -device that had been used more than once in the ""Doctor Who"" BBC TV series, it was nevertheless really neat to see it employed here not only with the past versions of old Spidey himself but also the attendant villains from those earlier movies, like the Green Goblin, Dr Octopus, Electro, The Lizard and Sandman. The interaction between the three Spider-Men as well as their nemeses, while occasionally clunky and clichéd, was, on the whole, quite funny and entertaining, I thought.

The strongest point of this film is undoubtedly the nostalgia of those who grew up with the films of Tobey McGuire and Andrew Garfield.

I like that better compared to their previous serious approach. Problems like plotholes and things that are just came to be are still here but it's somewhat justified because the whole plot makes no sense in the first place and so these plotholes are just a shortcut to get the characters to interact with each other and I'm honestly fine with that, its a movie where a grown man pretending to have superpowers anyway. Much of the films are nostalgia bait and much of them are effectively done. Instead of just referencing them they actually put some effort into creating something new but similar and incorporate bits from the past. Although some didn't turn well and come of as cringe like when aunt May died and she said great responsibility power thingy stuff, that was just cringe. Still the story here is the same old brain dead virtuous tripe and some actors are badly miscast, like Jamie Foxx. And there's no reason for this movie to be over 2 hours long.

","When you link the past of childhood with the present and the future, we say that it is something unusual. That's how we felt in Spider-Man No Way Home. The Marvel movie series always makes us feel something special emotionally and psychologically. This is how we feel in this movie. At first, when Peter Parker's secret was revealed, he wanted to fix his image in front of society after society know that he was the murderer of Mysterio. He wants to get his friends who are not guilty of Spider Man's actions to go to the university from which they were rejected because they are Peter Parker's friends. And then he went to Doctor Strange to help him that the whole world forget that Peter Parker is Spider Man. And here the amazing events began. Multiverse have been opened and everyone who knows Peter Parker has come to Peter Parker to take revenge on him. Bad guys we've known since childhood, Peter Parker the first, Peter Parker the second, and the third seeing them together fighting bad guys as if they were brothers is something I wished for ever since Spiderman appeared with the Avengers and here it is. What's sadder in the movie when May died and Peter Parker's reaction was this scene in which the director knew how to make people cry from a lot of sadness. Also when we saw Tobey Maguire, it was a more than wonderful scene, a scene that made us cry with a lot of joy. Events in which there is no boredom, the movie is more than wonderful in all respects. The soundtrack with the events and the battles with the bad guys is more than wonderful. Peter Parker's second scene when he saves M. G and does what he couldn't do is more than amazing scene. I hope we see another series where we see the three Spiderman together again. Finally, the end of the movie was realistic and a little sad, but it was a realistic ending and a prelude to the new Doctor Strange movie.

","The thing about multiverse stories is they are great for callbacks and humor...but not great for coherent plotlines or character arcs. (That's part of why the multiverse functioned best in Spider-verse: animated films can get away with being less tethered to reality.) Anyway, I loved seeing old characters return or the amusing banter, but this was my least favorite of the MCU Spider-man movies. The earlier tales, especially the first, worked because they felt like simpler teen movies and the main characters - Peter, Ned, MJ - had fantastic chemistry. Those moments were too few and far between here because we had so much multiverse to traverse and so much plot to explain. The twists were convoluted, the plot holes were large, and the whole thing worked better when it revolved around academic bowl and prom. Basically, my favorite MCU remains simpler MCU.

415,31 January 2022,aidannash-21510,10," With great stakes comes great expectations. And boy, were those expectations exceeded.
","This movie is... incredible. Out of all the Spider-Man movies I have seen (The original Raimi trilogy and the MCU trilogy), this one is the best. And that's saying a lot, because Spider-Man 2 was an absolute masterpiece that made me really appreciate not just Spider-Man, but Peter Parker, the boy behind the mask who wants so desperately to live two separate lives, one as a superhero with the responsibility to save the lives of the people around him, and another as just a regular, gold-hearted kid with friends and family. All that being said, however, the reason I like No Way Home more than Spider-Man 2 is because I had not actually seen the Raimi trilogy until AFTER I saw No Way Home, as that movie is what made me realize how deep Spider-Man actually is and that I wanted to look more into him. So, me loving this movie the most is almost definitely because of my personal experience with it. It sparked my interest in the webbed hero with just a kid behind the mask, and it did so while also living up to the expectations of long-time veterans and fans of him. This movie is an absolute must see if you are at all interested in Spider-Man. While it may not be perfect and have its flaws (like the pacing at some points being a bit weird and having quite a slow, drawn-out startup), it is still an absolute masterpiece in the Marvel series, and the writers, directors, and all others involved in the making of this film can be happy knowing that Stan Lee is smiling down upon them from heaven, truly proud of how his beautiful character and universe is being carried on to soar high.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

The plot seemed so dumb and lack luster. The background score seemed annoying at times. And as other reviews have pointed out, it was like someone had to tell us when exactly to laugh for what was an intended joke and on more than one occasion, the scene was a few seconds longer than it needed to be and it felt so awkward.

This is a spoiler free review, but Tom gives a brilliant performance in a scene that was a real tear jerker. As for the rest of the cast - they were also fantastic. This movie more than the others, really gave our main characters a chance to shine. Zendaya is also great here, as well as Jacob Batalon and Marisa Tomei
are also really good. I was also surprised by the screentime of, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Jamie Foxx and Benedict Cumberbatch.

Luckily, he has several wonderful supports -all along this chaotic journey- who give their heart to fill these roles in the best possible way, and that, in itself is very touching... But in this movie, the stakes resonate on a wide number of aspects, it isn't at all just about ""good & bad"", it's a human story (which makes it the magnificent movie that it is) and the hero at the core of all these meanders has to fully embrace his responsibilities... A true hero's journey sadly is punctuated with tragic steps that tell you how right is what you're doing.

You will see finally Parker in a mode mature serious role where his life and loved one are finally at stake where vengeance is clear and where the action sequences are real. The only drawback this movie had was too much talking and fewer action sequences. When you put too many villains in a 2.5 hour movie not everyone gets their fair share. If you recall that mistake is what doomed Tobey's Spider-Man. Only reason it didn't hurt no way home was because of different story line and fan favorite come backs.

560,13 April 2022,Spartan_1_1_7,8," Characterization, nostalgia and fan service done right. No Way Home is easily the best thing in MCU Phase 4.
","As a long time fan of The MCU since its inception back in 2008, Phase 4 has been wholly disappointing. Even the stuff I enjoyed had elements in them that kept it from being good, let alone great. Granted, I haven't seen everything in Phase 4 yet (a couple of Disney+ series I have yet to watch) but it's hard to muster up the excitement when you're consistently being let down by a franchise that you once revered. One of my main criticisms has been the world-building, particularly when it comes to the multiverse; the lazy writing and the incohesive melding of this expansion of the universe to what came before. So when it was revealed that the next Spider-Man movie will have multiverse shenanigans as they'll be bringing old villains from previous non-MCU spidey films as well as rumours that the spider-men themselves might make an appearance, I was a bit apprehensive about that news, especially considering how established characters have been treated going forward whether in the MCU or in other franchises which is probably the biggest criticism I have with Phase 4. Also, the fact that nostalgia baiting and keychain jangling have been the norm for a while now certainly wasn't helping the anticipation levels either. So imagine my surprise when this movie simply said ""Hey fam. Fret not. We got this."" Suffice to say I had an exhilarating experience and it reminded me of why I used to love the MCU.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

But when me and my younger brother watched this part of the Spider-Man series, we fell in love with it. It's the most appropriate version your kid could ever see. We also watched all Spider-Man (2002), half of Spider-Man 2, and almost finished Spider-Man 3, and finished all the Tom Holland movies.

","So much of the MCU now can feel repetitive or it can be hard to distinguish one movie from another. I like almost all the MCU movies to some degree (Thor: The Dark World and the Eternals represent the low end and even those movies don't outright suck) but with the sheer volume, not every movie is must-see. To No Way Home's Credit, it feels like essential viewing and it's worth it to see in on the big screen. With the stakes, the action and the new precedent it sets for merging different movie universes, it's operatic and although it could be enjoyed in the privacy of your home, I'd absolutely recommend catching it at your local theatre.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

This movie starts with peter parker at his flashy iron spider persona and ends with (spoiler alert) peter parker we all know and love(aka like tobey and andrew's). The plot is weak and electro(from TASM 2) who never knew the identity of Spider-Man in first place is.... just there for fan service and nostalgia. The serious moments get ruined by forced cringe jokes but otherwise the movie is fun and enjoyable. That being said, i am happy that its a reset movie(although with forced and weak plot but that's understandable) and now we will get to see the true Spider-Man in tom holland's next trilogy of 4-6. This homecoming trilogy falls weak to the previous two takes but i am hopeful that next trilogy will top the tobey's trilogy in the future now that he would NOT be assistant to some C-lister.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

",I don't know what it is but this movie felt like an episode of Seinfeld! Lol. It was basically a movie about nothing! So the plot line is that since Spider-Man's identity is revealed he and his friends cannot get into college. Instead of Tom Hollands character going and actually talking to the colleges he goes to Dr Strange to try to get everyone to forget who he was. Except a few loved ones of course. Dr. Strange actually points this out in the movie that he shoulda just went and talked to them. Which makes this plot line even more pathetic! Did the writers not have anything else to come up with. Regardless if this was in the comics or not it's just bad! Too many villains! Too many subplots! Too much talking! Not enough depth to said subplots. Aunt May dies and it's like it never happened! Just a bad overall movie!! There were some good parts so that's why I gave it a 5. And there's no way I'll be watching this more than once!,/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

","Was seriously not prepared to love this as much as I did. Spider-Man has never been my favorite superhero, although I have loved his addition to the Avengers. I won't rehash all of the great commentary in these reviews... But have to say that all of the old villains coming back was super awesome. But nothing is as fun, funny, and heartwarming as the three Peters together. I would not have predicted the unbelievable chemistry between the three of them. I could have watched them for hours! Some lovely moments - especially ""the hug."" The acting across the board was just tremendous. I worried about Zendaya, as so many Disney child actors are over the top and can't tone it down. She did a great job. Ned's new found gift was fun. Some of the highlights included Doctor Strange, whose command of the screen was just enormous. He really eclipsed almost everyone. But it was Tom Holland's movie. Marisa Tomei was amazing as always! And having Matt Murdock was an unbelievable treat! JK Simmons - fun. Jamie Foxx - terrific! Wong and Happy - fun seeing them. I wanted so badly for Happy to remember him at the grave... As if he had some special ability not to forget. I was hoping the same to be true for Doctor Strange. Not sure yet... I love any crossover! Tom Hardy mid-credits scene... odd but love the implication (if the Symbiote was left behind) and he'll be in a Marvel feature. Could say so much more...

I very much enjoyed the previous films from which this film derives its content, but bringing those characters and actors back into the current franchise was not fun, not interesting, not surprising. It was boring. It was a complete cop out. I felt ripped off. I was ripped off. We were all ripped off. And yet, somehow this drivel gets 8.7 stars on IMBD.

Before that, they get involved with the cops of the drones and I do like the cop in this who is the leading the entire thing but then later we head to aunt mays house and my boy daredevil is here I was happy when I saw him because now we'll be seeing more of him which I'm so thankful for I hated how they ended in season 3 and now him returning is amazing and I can't wait for the future for his character than peter parker goes to doctor strange to get a spell to forget that everyone knows who Spider-Man is and of course, Spider-Man said everyone that knew Spider-Man so the other Spider-Man come into play and the villains so than peter steal the box from doctor strange and the music in those scenes are amazing plus Spider-Man winning the fight against strange with math was pretty funny too. Than peter brings all the villains to the apartment to cure all of them but the goblin comes into Norman and brings absolute chaos while I like the conversations sandman is having with electro I love all that in this movie I want a superhero movie just like this it's knows that is funny and it's for the fans not for critics who just hate films. But anyway so Norman helps peter to get doc ock back to his normal self which does come to play in the ending of the film so than Norman becomes goblin again while sandman is on his side with electro and lizard is crazy so he is on his side too i love the fight peter vs Norman in the apartment he is getting wooped by Norman and I love it than his glider comes in where aunt may and she gets hit and sadly her death and the music the shot where peter is siting at where you see J. J Jameson is beautifully shot than ned starts doing magic and Andrew Garfield and Tobey go through the portals and my god I litterly loved it how they came into the movie perfect where that's almost 1 hour 30 minute into the movie brilliant and not having the entire movie about them but about tom Holland's peter dealing with his personal problems while having the death of aunt may than they think that they should heal the villains and all of them cuz he already got one cured why not cure the rest than a lot of comedy plays into this entire couple scenes with all three peter's talking about their universes and stuff than they lure the villains onto the statue of liberty this whole fighting on the statue of liberty i love with the iconic landing with the three Spider-Man and them curing all of them have really good fight scenes and doc-ock saying in the palm of my hand with the music my god i loved it so yeah all round an Spider-Man movie where all the spider-mans come along with the villains also and an amazing performance my tom Holland and William Defoe so I give Spider-Man No Way Home an A+ and 98%",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

","The last time we've gotten a Spider-Man franchise was from Marc Webb but didn't work out enough to be a trilogy. But MCU has managed to succeeded to conclude their Spider-Man trilogy. Spider-Man: No Way Home is close to be another one of my favorite MCU films. We've seen Peter Parker enter the MCU films even though he was owned by Sony. And yet, the movie has given the level of charm that sets the universe, including with the additions of the villains we know in the Spider-Man universe. And that makes the story a lot bigger than the previous two, along with the characters that both prove how we care for them and great additions that really work for the film. And of course, the visuals are incredibly crafted with both the costumes and the creativity from Strange Magic's powers. This is an absolute must watch for MCU films that have waited for this film. If you were excited and actually watched it in the theaters, good for you. Me, I didn't. But I just rented and watched it on streaming. Yeah, I miss going to the movies as well. I'm not gonna lie, this has came out a lot more what I expect. In fact, I find this to be the best of the three.

This film began the unfortunate streak of Marvel 'doing a big thing' just because fans want to see it, with no build-up and no feeling of a rewarding payoff. I'm, of course, talking about bringing back every previous actor from a Spider-Man project that they could get. Releasing alongside the likes of Into the Spiderverse, the MCU could not help, but jump to the finish line and drop the biggest 'surprise' they could think of. To get to this point as rapidly as possible; they ignore the character traits of Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Peter Parker (Tom Holland) by turning them into selfish, ignorant, and narcissistic fools. This yada yada's enough of the plot to get out nostalgic trip of returning cast, who jump on screen waving their jingling keys, only to leave, with no substance to be found. Ironically, these additions are the best part, as it is nice to see the green room type interactions that the Spider-Men have with each other. In a better film, these moments would've had more charm and character.

This movie was gorgeous on so many levels, I can't believe they really brought back Tobey Maguire, and Andrew Garfield, I didn't really think they were gonna do it. This movie is truly the live action Spider-Verse movie I've been waiting for. It was good to see Tobey and Andrew return as Spider-Man, this is the best spider-man movie imo. Doctor Strange was an outstanding supporting character in the film, I loved all the spider-man villains reprising their roles. Willem Defoe was very intimidating which made his performance incredible, he was definitely one of the reasons this movie was so epic. I'm excited to see what they will do next now that Tom Hollands Spider-Man is all alone now that Ned and MJ have no memory of him, I am curious to see how the three of them will reconnect if they make a fourth film.

MJ is working when Peter and his other friend go there to talk about college acceptance. No one is there, why? Everyone knows that's Spider-Man. Peter, his friends and aunt may should be all celebrities that can't be out in public. Then we have the time when Peter go to meet dr. Strange. He tells him to erase everyone's memory. But he kept telling strange he wants this person to remember and then that person. Why was Dr. Strange even doing that? Why didn't he just stop the spell and tell him exactly who he wanted to remember. This made Dr. Strange look like a fool who just got his powers. Dumb!!! The main problem of this movie is when they finally get all the bad guys and Dr. Strange gets ready to undo the spell and have the bad guys sent to their world. Peter Parker/spiderman doesn't agree because he doesn't want them to die. What the hell!!!!! What is a he a saint that needs to save everyone? Even the bad guys? This pathetic spiderman causes this mess through Mindless Dr. Strange and then Peter has the audacity to tell strange that he doesn't agree and fights strange. This causes even a bigger mess. Spider-Man is not like a 13 year old that they made him out to look. He's like 17/18. He shouldn't be this dumb and immature. There were good moments in the movie which was really well done.

I hope too see all the Peter Parker's again ,even with a bigger involvement .It would be cool too see Spiderman 9 with Garfield and Spiderman 10 with Maguire and so on , this would be something WILD .I'm really sad nobody wanted to see the original back or even his Japan version in this movie ,it looks like a form of disrespect for the history of Spiderman.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

So while the cameos feel great, the peak of action in the film was not the battles with the villains , but the battle between Dr Strange and Spidey and after that everything else felt pretty bland . In fact due to multiple villains, there was almost no space left for a drama Spider man 2 style, so what we get is a numerous action sequences with a lot of mess happening in the background...

","I was not a big fan of Homecoming or Far From Home. I enjoyed Spiderman (the character) in Civil War and the last two Avengers movies, but I couldn't get into the stand alone films. After watching this movie I understand why. Neither of the previous movies had compelling villains in my mind. Vulture, even though I think Keaton is a great actor, was forgettable. To be honest, the only thing I remember from the last movie was the Peter was outed as Spiderman at the end. Another thing I realized is in the MCU Parker didn't really do anything to earn what he has. Stark handed him some toys and he did his thing. He had no real motivation to be Spiderman. Tobey Maguire's (the best IMO) Spiderman was responsible for his Uncle Ben's death. This motivated him to do good. Garfield's Spiderman had the same motivation. So in this movie the villains (from other universes/previous films) were great. To me the film really hit its stride when the other two Peter Parkers appeared. The back and forth between them made the movie as far as dialogue goes (that and Dr. Strange who is my favorite Avenger next to Stark). Tom Holland is the weakest Parker/Spiderman, but he does a decent job here. His pain was believable when he lost Aunt May. His anger was palpable when he was trying to kill Osborne as well. So in the end I guess I'm saying that the characters from the other universes made the movie for the most part. The film did make me want to watch the old Spiderman movies again (and re-watch Daredevil whose cameo was awesome).",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

In the last two movies that Holland did as spider man, I was slightly disappointed because we only got to see a child who was constantly babied by Tony Stark. The Spider-Man who we watched in Homecoming and Far From Home hadn't really earned his place in my heart, with Holland's childish charm being over used and making the character of Peter Parker a boy who frankly doesn't live up to the standard set by his predecessors. In this movie however, not only did it give me a nerdgasm due to the fantastic ensemble cast, but I finally got to see Holland flex his acting muscles and show me whey he was cast in his role and why he has reached his levels of stardom.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

So many easter eggs from many many universe, Let's be clear on something that Tom Holland is the best spider-man ever made, tom = andrew + tobey, doctor strange was fantastic and Ned too, I cried so hard when May died, the movie is so sad, No one on earth know Peter Parker now, not even his friends, and he didn't tell them because they were happy without him, I liked venom but I want it to be in the movie, Also i wanted a largest movie, The end credit scene, Doctor Strange 2, IT'S EPIC ! Loved that daredevil was here even if he was for a minute, so much to talk about. Loved when they hugged each other, and ""With great power come great responsibilities"", when they re-do some scene of old spider-man it was good, It was beautiful to watch but I would liked more colours when the fight in the end. Happy don't know him anymore, it the end of the friendship with ned, the atmosphere in the cinema was insane. He needs to tell everyone cause at this point he's literally lost every single person in his life, he helped save half the universe, he was the reason tony wanted to discover time travel and now no one will know.

","After reading a few reviews, I've come to the conclusion that I'm probably too old for these kind of movies. I am a big fan of the Marvel movies, so I know the whole series. Admittedly, I've never been a big fan of the Spider-Man movies, with the exception of the first two with Tobey Maguire. But let's face it, this movie is a smorgasbord of stupid decisions, starting with the very first one that carries the whole movie. How can Dr. Strange recite that absolutely stupid spell that everyone warned him about and do it without questioning anything? That's what the whole movie is built on, and also the consequence of it at the end. Whereby the final punchline makes no sense at all. Attention spoilers: If everyone forgets ""who Spider-Man is"", in the sense that no one associates Peter Parker with Spider-Man anymore, then everyone doesn't necessarily have to forget who Peter Parker is. Nobody forgets Spiderman either. In my opinion, this twist was only built in so that the dramaturgy of the film works. But it remains totally illogical and leads the whole thing ad absurdum. The special effects are also really bad in parts. The train scene in the mirror dimension remains especially negativ in memory (oh come on, you can manage the Green Screen better than this)...and it is a key scene at the same time. I'm probably pretty alone with my opinion, but I can not give more than 6 stars (and that's already generous). If you liked this movie, it's fine, enjoy it.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

","The strongest part of this movie is easily the acting in this movie. When the actors were filming this movie, they didn't know there were going to be three more movies after this and you can easily tell they wanted to bring their all to this movie. There is so much emotion in this movie that everybody conveys really well and everybody easily switched from serious to fun. This movie was easily Tom Holland's best performance as Peter and Spider-Man as you see his struggles and can easily relate to him. What definitely helped with everybody's performances was the writing for this movie. The writing easily made it seem like everybody in this wasn't always following a script and was just saying what seemed natural at the moment. I will say though for the writing the humour, for the most part, does work but there were still a few jokes that just didn't land or fit the tone properly. One thing that honestly surprised me about this was the pacing in this movie and how smooth it was. Going into this movie I thought this movie was going to feel slow in the beginning and then rushed but in reality, only two parts that felt rushed but both are justified because of the story. The last thing I'll mention briefly is the action in this movie. The action in this movie is easily some of the best for this series both Spider-Man-wise and MCU and I found myself smiling during every fight scene. In the end, Spider-Man: No Way Home completes this trilogy with a bang and cements this as a perfect MCU trilogy.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

It seems a bit ""first world problems"" to me to be honest. Maybe all 3 characters would not have gotten into MIT even without the identity reveal. Did the characters ever think about that?

I was like most fans, thrilled by the triumphs, but equally let down by the disappointments - and there were more than a few disappointments in the past two decades that Spidey had been on the big screen. And that is what makes SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME something special, because director Jon Watts, screenwriters Chris Mackenna and Erik Sommers, and whoever else at Sony who was calling the shots, have leaned into all those high points, and let downs, and given the fans something truly special that gives us closure, while opening the doors to so many new possibilities.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

987,18 December 2021,SamuSixx,8," Nice, but does the beauty depend on the films themselves or on the previous ones?
","I managed to survive the spoilers for once. Yesterday I went to see this film and the expectations were very, very high and I must say that I did not leave the room disappointed. Let's go in order, the film opens straight from the end of Spider-Man: Far From Home where Mysterio reveals Spider-Man's identity to the whole world, and that was something I really appreciated. The fact that the film is based on the fact that Spider-Man's true identity has been spread is fascinating because such a situation has never happened before and it is interesting to see the reaction of people to this news. The fact is that Peter Parker and all the people who have been around him are seen as threats, this aspect will have an important impact on the studies of MJ and Ned who in fact will not be able to enter MIT. At that point Peter turns to Doctor Strange to make everyone forget who Spider-Man is. During the spell, the multiverse opens by letting the most loved and evil enemies of the other universes such as The Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Lizard, Electro and Sand-Man enter their universe. Peter finds himself having to capture these villains to be able to bring them back to their universe, once captured Peter learns that almost all the villains are destined to die at the hands of Spider-Man, obviously of their respective universes. At that point Peter tries to ""fix"" these villains to try to save them, but to do so he had to stop Doctor Strange who wanted to send them back. Peter, once Doctor Strange stops, gets to work to help the villains, but there was already tension in the air. Peter manages to help Doctor Octopus to have control over the tentacles, he had prepared a cure for everyone but the evil part of the Goblin made itself felt and rebelled against Peter bringing the rest of the villains to do the same, in the escape Goblin kills aunt May. Ned and MJ who were worried about Peter, try to get him to them through a portal, and actually Spider-Man was there, but Andrew Garfield's. Then Ned tries the spell again and brings in another Spider-Man but Tobey Maguire's. To conclude, the Spider-Man reunite, heal the villans and Doctor Strange returns, but in the meantime something went wrong and all the enemies of all the other Spider-Man universes were about to arrive, so Peter asks Doctror Strange to redo the spell and make everyone forget who it is. Strange casts the spell, everyone returns to their universe, and everyone forgets Spider-Man's identity. This was the story in a very short time, I left out some details because I wanted to talk about it better in this subjective part of me. I liked the film itself a lot because we finally saw Holland's Spider-Man become a mature and responsible Spider-Man, it's as if the previous two films only served to anticipate this growth. I liked the fact that Aunt May in the last moments of her life says to Peter: ""with great powers comes great responsibilities"" and that this phrase, during the confrontation with the other two Spider-Man, was repeated almost in chorus. The characterization of the characters is fantastic, we finally have personalities in this film, some deeper others less but for example Aunt May who has never had a very important role in the films, in this one she has a fundamental one. The villans are managed very well, I loved the Goblin because basically he hasn't lost his charm and his madness and I liked Doctor Octopus when he becomes good, a little less Lizard that we say was not very present if not for a few jokes and a few punches. I enjoyed the numerous Easter-Eggs featured in the film such as: Miles Morales, Kraven, Venom, Harry Osborn, Daredevil etc ...
Let's talk about the two post-credits scenes, in the first we see Eddie Brock setting himself in this universe (Tom Holland's) and at some point he is sent back to his universe again but leaving a part of the symbiont. This suggests that when we see a Venom inside the MCU it will not be played by Tom Hardy but rather another who will have the symbiote on him, and it is something that I appreciated. While the second Post-credits scene is simply a Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness teaser and is simply spectacular. I end this very fast and very long review by saying that this is by no means a perfect film from a directing and scenic point of view but it is emotionally gorgeous, despite many directing and plot errors it is a film that every Spider-Man fan must absolutely see just for entertain oneself, I would define in short a film practically only fan-service but not made at random. But I asked myself a question at the end of the movie, is this movie good because it is actually good or is it good just because there are the other Spider-Man and villains we had seen and loved in the past?",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

It becomes a confusion as hell when Peter Parker 1 (Holland) and co., girlfriend MJ (Zendaya) and best friend Ned (Batalon), attempt to 'save' those villains (how 'holier-than-thou'!) and no accomplished writers can make a virtue out of the desultory explanations of how that can be done (the corollary to mingle magic with science), all comes down to a devastating tragedy to plunge Peter into the nadir before he gangs up with Peter Parker 2 (Maguire) and 3 (Garfield), confraternity incontrovertibly triumphs over villainy, and when the dust settles, Parker 1 has a hefty price to pay, but he does it with resignation and renewed optimism.""",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

","Peter Parker Identity as Spider-Man has been revealed by Mysterio. Now his life's forever changes as he's hounded by the media, the police and the public. However peter life is not the only one affected as his friends and Aunt May are also persecuted. Peter eventually get the idea to go see Doctor Strange(Benedict Cumberbatch) to have him cast a spell that would make the whole world forget he's spiderman. The spell goes wrong and now Supervillains from other universes invade this one. Now Peter has to make things right and put everything right. This movie while still following the MCU formula manages to still gives something fresh and unique. All the hinting of the multiverse with Doctor strange and Loki now it finally put in to play. The films an overall a nostalgic trip to all Spider-Man fans. To see all these old characters return in a single movie together, I can't be helped but feel warm on the inside. Seeing William Dafoe return as the Goblin and Alfred Molina as Dr octopus truly is fascinating. It feels very much like a into the spider verse live action. While some Villains are given more purposes and reason, really the Lizard and Sandman are kinda pushed to the side. Others like Electro(Jamie Foxx) is given better justice here are relevant to the story and theme of peter as a character. Their not just showing up getting beat and moving on to the next. All of them are in the movie pretty much from the moment their introduce till the finale. Though the two best hands-down are Norman and Otto there's no half ass phone in and they both reprice the roles perfectly capturing those images at the Raimi films are remembered. Peter as a character by the end of this movie has developed more into the Spiderman many know him as. I was never really on board with him as this kid who everybody tony stark just handed everything. Tony given him all his tech, he's having to follow in Tony's footsteps. He didn't have individuality. While peter he makes really stupid decisions really everything that happens is his fault. His actions do have consequences and Doctor Strange really is the voice of reason. M. J & Ned do serve a purposes and while they have their moments, but they weight on the movie in some parts where they should not be involved. Though M. J I was brought around to her more here. She has more personality and opened up now. I didn't care for that whole emo/Goth attitude. I really feel more for her and peters relationship. J. K Simmon as Jameson is great that all I can say he's Jameson and it's nice to have him back in these movies. The actions is great when the action begins it begins and it's amazing. Doc Ock on the Bridge and this amazing fight with Dr strange with such tripping visuals. They have tons of great moments. The movies great with tons of fans service done right that doesn't come off as pandering or lazy. The only things is that unless you seen the other Sony films your feeling towards the films might vary. If your only familiar with this spiderman then many of the older characters won't grab you the same as older fans. It really is a movie for huge Spidey fans with tons of callbacks and references. *Spoilers* The media has done their best to avoid it, but yes both Tobey & Andrew are in the movie. It's amazing they both make all their scenes count. I love the humor between the three of them, the chemistry Especially Tobey and Andrew they really play off each other. They actually serve a purpose ot just thrown in for the fan service, but actually have have their perk to help defeat each villain. I love that Andrew while not my favorite has a very Charismatic charm. He gets closure over Gwen's deaths, the banter about Tobey's Webbing. All of it's great I wanted more them together in the film, but the time they have again they nail it and made it count. Also seeing Matt Murdock Daredevil make a cameo was great and gives hope to him and the other Netflix stars bleeding into the movies or show's . Though some things don't make sense and unsatisfying. Sandman has no reason to turn on peter like at all, he plays in Peter defense the entire time against electro. The second goblin reveals himself and electro bolts he just leaves with them. Tom Hardy Eddie Brock/Venom shows up in the end credits they do nothing with this. They pull him back to his reality he's behind a drop of symbiote, but why want was the point. Teasing audiences like they were getting this venom. So you can do another venom in this universe?

This is also the worst of the new MCU spiderman movies. The reason for that is the movie is filled with too much unnecessary drama and cringe worthy comedy. I watched Dr Strange and the Multiverse of Madness just last week and it didn't feel boring at any point. This movie made me check my watch at least 3 times. A big flaw is the inclusion of so many irrational and completely dumb decisions which characters would never normally make. Why? Well the writers are too lazy to think around the most obvious path to getting to the end of the story. Cause if Dr Strange or Spiderman did what they normally would, this movie wouldn't even exist. It wasn't completely a waste though. I find acting was good from almost everyone, it was nice to see old faces back.

The amazing Spider-Man movies were great in their own ways but suffered from some plot issues and an unfinished story.

","I've been looking through some reviews of my favorite movies and after watching spider-man no way home i've think you have overhyped the movie a bunch. Don't get me wrong I think spider-man no way home is a great movie and a great (maybe) ending to Tom Hollands triology in the Spider-man movies. The problem with me and especially marvel movies is that I feel like i watch the same movie on and on with just some small changes of character. That isn't the problem with this movie, and i love how they have handled the multiversial topic which can often get out of hand and sometimes chaotic. I love how good Tobey, Andrew and Tom acts together making me think how i would love to see them in another movie together. I can write a whole book about how i love Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin but i'll let you find out that yourself.

A big factor of my enjoyment came from the energy in my theater, when Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man came on screen, my theater went ballistic and it just added to my enjoyment. I felt the quality step-up from the previous two movies(which I still love), wether it be the cinematography, the dialogue (especially in the second half), or the emotional stakes the film has. It also addressed some of the grievances many people have had with this franchise of spider man films, this is the fact that Peter feels like ""Iron Man Jr."" this gives Peter an entire fresh start and leads the way for so many more spider-man stories to come.

1124,25 December 2021,raine162,10," best spider man movie ever
","My god this was a fantastic movie. The reason why i was so excited about it was because of how they brought back all the actors who played the heros and villains in the previous spider man movies, and of course that aspect was awesome, but even that was just the icing on the cake. Even without the returning actors this movie would still be fantastic. One of the things i liked about this movie was that unlike the previous MCU spider man movies it actually had a more serious tone to it, not gonna spoil anything but it does have some genuinely powerful moments in terms of emotion and narratine. I also liked it how they had a couple scenes where we saw the 3 spider men interacting with eachother in interesting and funny ways, like that scene where tobey maguire showed them that he can shoow webs out of his hands unlike the other 2 who need web cartridges. Yes some of those scenes did drag on for a bit too long but i really didnt mind because it was still entertaining. There was also a lot of references to the other spider man film series, both serious and comedic ones. Now one of the things i was worried about going in was the movies 2 and a half hour runtime, i was worried the wovie would drag on like avengers endgame did, but thankfully the movie never felt like it was padding itself out and the plot was always moving at a steady pace. Now to be fair this movie isnt perfect, the plot has a couple minor contribences, some of the jokes fell flat on their face, and tobey maguire looked way too old in this one, to the point where he was almost unrecognizable. I mean i get that its been over a decade since his last spider man movie so of course he would have aged a bit since then, but i still think they could have solved that with a bit of makeup like they did with samuel l jackson in captain marvel. Thankfully though the movies strengths well outweighed their flaws so im still giving it a perfect 10. The ending was very strong and conclusive, im just hoping that marvel finally puts the tom holland spider man franchise to rest after this because honestly, there couldnt be a better way to conclude the trilogy than with this.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

What is so amazing about this film is the story fits right with previous Avenger movies, but some how nails who Spiderman really is to all of us.

","The new Spider-Man of the Marvel Cinematic Universe was introduced in Captain America: Civil War, then he got his solo outings, Homecoming was great, and Far from Home was good, I was highly excited for this third instalment for the hero. Basically, Quentin Beck has framed Peter Parker (Tom Holland) for his murder and exposed his secret identity as Spider-Man. Parker, his girlfriend Michelle ""MJ"" Jones-Watson (Zendaya), his best friend Ned Leeds (Jacob Batalon), and his aunt May (Marisa Tomei) are interrogated by the Department of Damage Control. The charges against Parker are dropped, with the help of lawyer Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox), but now the whole world knows that Peter is Spider-Man. Peter and his friends are constantly approached and gazed at by press and everyone at school, and the negative publicity causes problems. Parker, MJ, and Ned are devastated when their applications for MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) are rejected. Following this, Parker decides to visit the New York Sanctum and asks Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), to cast a spell and make the world forget that he is Spider-Man. Doctor Strange starts to cast the spell but is interrupted repeatedly by Parker wanting to alter it so his loved ones will retain their memories. The spell is corrupted, Strange is forced to contain it as it and destabilised and becomes potentially universe-ending and he makes Parker leave. Parker goes to the Alexander Hamilton Bridge and tries to convince the MIT Assistant Vice Chancellor (Paula Newsome). The bridge is suddenly attacked by Otto Octavius aka Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina). During their fight, Octavius rips Parker's nanotechnology from his Iron Spider suit which bonds with his mechanical tentacles, allowing Parker to disable them. Then Norman Osborn aka the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) appears and attacks, before Strange teleports Parker back to the Sanctum. Octavius, or ""Doc Ock"", is locked in a cell, along with Dr. Curt Connors aka The Lizard (Rhys Ifans). Strange explains that before the corrupted spell was contained, it summoned people from other universes who know Spider-Man's identity. Strange instructs Parker, MJ, and Ned to find and capture the other people from the multiverse. They are successful in finding and capturing Max Dillon aka Electro (Jamie Foxx) and Flint Marko aka Sandman (Thomas Haden Church). Meanwhile, Osborn splits from his Green Goblin personality and reclaims control of himself and May comforts him before Parker retrieves him. Osborn, Octavius and Dillon discuss their battles with Spider-Man and realise they were pulled from their universes just before their deaths. Strange prepares to reverse the contained spell and send the villains back to their respective universes, but Parker argues that they could have a second chance and be saved from their fates if they are cured of their powers and insanity. Strange disagrees with Parker, so Parker steals the contained spell, and traps Strange in the Mirror Dimension. May takes the villains to the apartment of Harold ""Happy"" Hogan (Jon Favreau), May's boyfriend and head of security for Stark Industries. Using Stark technology, they cure Octavius, but Osborn's Goblin persona takes control and convinces the uncured villains to betray Parker. Dillon, Marko, and Connors escape, while the Goblin fatally injures May, Parker is too late to save her as she succumbs to her wounds. May tells Parker that ""with great power, there must also come great responsibility"", before dying in his arms. Ned finds Strange's sling ring and discovers its power to create portals, and he and MJ use it to try and find Peter. They instead open portals to universes with alternate versions of Peter Parker, who were also summoned by Strange's spell. To avoid confusion, Peter from the Goblin, Octavius, and Marko's universe is nicknamed ""Peter-Two"" (Tobey Maguire), and Peter from Connors and Dillon's universe is nicknamed ""Peter-Three"" (Andrew Garfield). The group eventually locate Peter from this universe, nicknaming him ""Peter-One"", but upset about the death of his aunt, he is ready to give up and send the villains home to die. The alternate Peters share stories of losing loved ones and encourage Peter-One to go on in May's honour, and they work together to develop cures for the villains. The group lure Dillon, Marko, and Connors to the Statue of Liberty. As a fight ensues between the Spider-Men and the villains, Peter-One and Peter-Two successfully cure Connors and Marko. They are later joined by Octavius who arrives and cures Dillon, while Ned inadvertently frees Strange from the Mirror Dimension with a portal. The Goblin appears and unleashes the contained spell, causing the barriers to break down between the other universes. Strange attempts to stop the devastation while an enraged Peter-One tries to kill the Goblin. Peter-Two stops him while Peter-Three helps Peter-One inject the Goblin with his cure, restoring Osborn's sanity. As the multiverse falls apart, Peter-One realises that the only way to prevent further catastrophe and restore existence is to erase himself from everyone's memory and requests that Strange do so. Peter is given a few moments to say his goodbyes, he promises MJ and Ned that he will find them again. The spell is cast, the two Peters and their villains are returned to their respective universes, including Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy), who unknowingly leaves behind a piece of the Venom symbiote. Two weeks later, with all memories of Parker's identity erased, he finds MJ and Ned in a coffee shop and intends to reintroduce himself but changes his mind. He later visits May's grave, where he has a conversation with Hogan, again without revealing himself, but is inspired to carry on. He later makes a new suit and resumes his reputation as a vigilante. Also starring J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, Benedict Wong as Wong, Tony Revolori as Flash Thompson, Angourie Rice as Betty Brant, Hannibal Buress as Coach Wilson, Martin Starr as Mr. Harrington, J. B. Smoove as Mr. Dell, and Gary Weeks as Agent Foster. Holland is spirited, more vulnerable and likeable as before, Cumberbatch is reliable, Zendaya, Tomei and Batalon are good support as his loved ones, Molina, Dafoe, and the other well-known stars back as the villains is great, and of course Maguire and Garfield returning, and all three Spider-Men onscreen together was exciting. You completely forget that the film is almost two and a half hours long, the time is used wisely to tell a well-scripted story, with spectacular sequences of special effects magic, well-timed moments of humour and emotion, and surprise moments that will satisfy the fans, an inventive, exciting, and highly impressive superhero fantasy action adventure.

","This spider man film personally topped the trilogy of Tom Hollands spider man saga, it had so many pinnacle points which made feel more meaningful. The acting work of Zendaya, Jacob and Tom was to perfection, along with Jon faveru who although wasn't seen that much, made the film feel like it belonged to him whenever he was on screen. The film is well balanced with comedy, sadness and joy which combined and mixed in the right way give the film a sense of perfection. The film always kept me guessing as to what would happen next, it also brought back memories of my childhood with the appearance of Toby maguire and Andrew Garfield, who portray Peter Parker from their time lines. When the three spider men are all together it brought a tear to my eye and made my inner child jump with joy. If you are a fan of spider man I highly recommend this film for all the family.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

The very first preview for the third Spidey didn't arrive until tonight, just under four months until the movie's December 17 debut, and, even then, the argument could be made that it only materialized because of a leaked - and work-in-progress - version from yesterday had forced both Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios's hand.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

","SPIDER-MAN:NO WAY HOME (2021) pulled off a neat trick. It's a modern film that I heard nothing but great things about and unbridled praise where I almost fully agree with the raves. The only other major film in recent years that's been praised where I agree with the popular opinion is Joker from 2019, but then it's almost impossible to deny that film's brilliance based on Joaquin Phoenix's all-time performance. The fact that I even like No Way Home is a feat because I find most modern comic book superhero movies to be interchangeably cringe with too much comedy, CGI, and unrelatable characters. A huge reason that No Way Home breaks the mold is because it does something that feels unique. Yes, there has been multi-verse content before, but not on this level, in my opinion. I mean, the CW's Arrowverse does it's annual multi-verse gathering of superheroes, but that network is the definition of cringe content. Then there's the DCEU and MCU team ups, but that's just like the CW stuff but with higher quality and (slightly) better acting. Well, maybe not better acting in the DCEU!

This film picks up right where 'Farm From Home' left off, with the world now knowing Peter is Spider-Man, which make things very difficult for him, MJ (Zendaya), Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), Ned (Batalon) and Happy (Favreau).",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

He is seen having playful banter with the other spidermen and barely seems angry even right after aunt may dies. He seems more sad then angry even as the other peter parkers tell him not to go murder people.

Also aunt May saying the line was such barf. The older spider men create that nostalgic feeling and get you hyped for the final battle, but the battle falls flat and favors the random sidekick formula as marvel always does. For me th most difficult thing was seeing serious actors playing serious villans in this marvel universe. Something about it just didnt work. The nostalgia made for a great ride but the storyline of the MCU spidey was far too thin to support anything but that. Zendaya seems like a nice gal, but her acting across from Tom is flatter than the first soda ever made would be if it were still in a cup today. Number one flaw is the CGI is horrendous.

1280,12 June 2023,andresromerocompain,9," Can we just make all of Marvel about Spider-Man already
","Spider-Man is a character that I have been incredibly close with since I was a little kid, and he has always been my favorite superhero. But the past few years I find myself loving him more and more that I don't really feel any shame when I say he is my favorite character of all time. So I was obviously looking forward to this. And may I say. Without a doubt, the best movie of this trilogy and the best Marvel movie to come out in a while. It delivered on everything I wanted and so much more, and it improved on a lot too. I wasn't expecting to love this movie as much as I did. Even with all the dumb stuff that happens in this movie, it literally did the Raimi Spider-Man trick by being very self aware about how stupid it was and using that to its advantage to be funny and entertaining. A very stupidly fun story with way more heart and emotional moments than I was expecting, good visual effects for the most part, great characters as always, terrific performances. It even got better in some elements too. The score for this movie I thought was excellent and I found to be more memorable, the action sequences were more creative and were exciting, the cinematography and the direction were really improvised and way more creative which is a big plus this movie has and was better than the previous two. And I just think the movie as a whole a a big impact on me and hit more. What I was fearing was that with all the characters and references they brought from all the other Spider-Man movies was they wouldn't be utilized well at all. But they actually took the Spider-Verse method and took all these elements and characters, actually make them part of the story, having us see more of them and doing something genuinely creative with all of them. All the villains like Doc Ock and Green Goblin were great, and even the villains like Electro, Sandman, and The Lizard we're actually so much fun and we're better characters than how they were previously. And there is no doubt in my mind the Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man and Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man completely stole the show. It was a great story beat and character beat for this Spider-Man and made for an emotional punch and end to the movie too. It even made me appreciate the Andrew Garfield movies a lot more, which I wasn't expecting. Like this is the best Andrew Spider-Man movie, and like no joke, I thought he was the best character in the movie. Even all the other characters like JJ Jameson, Aunt May, Doctor Strange, Ned, and MJ are still great and are given a lot to do as well. It isn't a perfect movie of course. There are some issues with things like the plot, the effects on the Spider-Man suit at certain points, and other things. But I think as a whole, the movie just works so incredibly well that I just forgot about my issues and it didn't even matter. It really feels like this whole movie is a clear labor of love from start to end and everyone really cared about making this movie as good as it is. And it captured what I love about this character and made me excited to see where he is taken in the next movies. Which is another element I didn't mention. The first 2 acts are really good, but the 3rd act of the movie is where it really shines and becomes great. How it all wraps up and where this character is at the end I think is perfect. It feels like he has fully become Spider-Man I know and love. I still love Homecoming and Far From Home, but this one is way better and way more effective and gave me a lot more. But in the end, I still would love more out of this movie, in a good way. If there is one last thing I have to say, everything going on with Spider-Man is really the only thing I am interested and have actual excitement for in all of Marvel. Because it feels like everyone involved, and both Marvel and Sony are putting their heart into him and caring about everything. So Marvel, as a fan, here's a word of advice from me to you, just make everything about Spider-Man now. Give us more of the animated Spider-Verse movies, and please, for the love of god, MAKE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 3 AND SAM RAIMI'S SPIDER-MAN 4!!!! Thank you. And I'm crossing my fingers that Tom, Tobey, and Andrew's Spider-Man show up again in Across The Spider-Verse.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

","As much as I think Tom Holland is a capable actor, I'd be lying if I didn't say that I've had some issues with his incarnation of Spider Man. He's always given great performances and he is undoubtably the most comic accurate version of the character but my recurring issue with Spider Man in the MCU is that he just never seems to be able to fully stand on his own. Both of his solo films heavily revolve around Tony Stark and in his other appearances he's been a smaller part in a larger whole. Despite all that however I was (like everyone) so excited for this film and the possibilities it could bring even if there was the risk of it relying too heavily on fan service and nostalgia as opposed to a solid story. But I have to say that this film really lived up to the hype and managed to use its fan service in the best possible manner to create for a film that was endlessly enjoyable, thrilling and surprisingly emotional.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

It's amazing enough that this trilogy does this very well, most third movies in trilogies don't really satisfy. But what is extraordinary about this movie is that it not only wrap the story up perfectly, it also adds extra depth and closure to the other (unfinished) Spider-Man series. It even expands the MCU without losing it's focus on what is important here: Spider-Man becoming Spider-Man. Peter Parker has now grown up.

","I'm a 99' baby, I grew up with Tobey Maguire in which I became obsessed with that Spider-man at a very young age (still am). In my opinion, Tom Holland is my least favourite Spider-man. I give this movie a high score of 7 because the way I felt during the movie allowed me to relive my youth. I must say, it was extremely special to have a collaboration of the villains we all know and love. I appreciated the hand to hand combat in this movie, I think there was more fist fighting in this movie than Tom's previous 2 combined. I'm a sucker for some good action/fight scenes (hence why I'm a huge Maguire fan). I thought this was a great movie however, I'm still choosing Sam Raimis universe 10/10 times, no questions asked. Incredible CGI considering it's era, amazing acting, superb writing. I also saw another fan review for NWH that is very true- everybody HATED Spider-man 3 because there was too many villains, why isn't everybody saying that now? What's different? I loved Spider-man 3 from day 1, but now it just seems everyone turns their head only because it's Tom Holland. I almost feel this movie was becoming too personal, with too many corny (non-comical) jokes. Also, Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molinas character arch's felt different, and it almost seemed like they were instructed to portray their original characters slightly different. Maybe I'm being a bit too harsh and I'll probably get a lot of hate for this. I guess I'm just being stubborn because I miss that authentic feeling of the Tobey Maguire trilogy. He's obviously aged 15+ years and his suit was slightly different and his typical action sequences went from a 10 to a 3- it just felt .... Off. Let's be real, we don't really get that hand to hand, fist fights in these movies that you'd get in Raimis universe.

Unable to cope with the fallout he calls upon Stephen Strange to help undo the damage, but when the multiverse is undone by his meddling, the dangers for Parker grow exponentially.

Lots of little interwoven goodies for fans to look forward to, plus a wave of nostalgia and a surprising amount of emotional gravity and vigor make this much more impactful than the recent MCU fare, headlined by Holland and a slew of invaluable co-stars. ***½",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

As trailers indicated, Peter Parker's spell with Doctor Strange goes awry when he tries to interfere with it after he's been outed. Unlike homecoming, thankfully they didn't make Peter as Strange's apprentice. It is more of a Spiderman movie than a Doctor Strange movie. The appearance of previous Spiderman movie characters gives much depth to the story and all the actors especially Dafoe did an incredible job. Of course, the open secret of the appearance of Spidermen is what makes it like an event like Infinity war and Endgame. The writers handled both characters very well and did them justice by having them in the extended cameo. The mid and post-credits scene are perhaps one of the most interesting ones in MCU. The movie's main drawback is its plot. Don't get me wrong, it was just average and unoriginal, partly inspired from Spider-man: into the Spiderverse movie but saved by engaging screenplay and amazing presence of actors.

Then in the second half there is a pointless sacrifice as part of an attempt to sort of reboot the series, an effort to restart the character back to his beginnings.

","Right off the bat, I must say I enjoyed this film a lot, but this doesn't change the numerous problems the first act of this film has. And quite honestly I'm surprised that not a lot of people have been talking about how weak the premise for the plot is. It involves Doctor Strange (one of the most responsible characters in the MCU) going through with an irresponsible and quite frankly stupid idea that Peter comes up with that causes various Spiderman villains arriving in their reality. The problem explains itself. Once I look past that, I see a excellent Spiderman film that delivers on so many levels for so many people. If you like Tobey and Andrew's Spiderman films than you have them appearing in this, if you like the idea of Tom's Spider-Man's love interest than you have him and Zendaya who have great chemistry on screen and give you a romance that you can buy into. If you like Doctor Strange and multiversal madness, then you have that, if you find Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin to be the best live action Spiderman villain than you have him making an appearance. As you can quite clearly see from those examples there is plenty of fan servicing elements and I honestly find it amazing they managed to put it all together and make a coherent story. Is it a great story? Not necessarily but it has nice moments and provides a great end to Holland's arc and even gives him a 'Uncle Ben moment' which in my opinion was one thing his Spiderman was missing.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

","An indecisive Peter Parker messes up Dr. Strange's (Benedict Cumberbatch) spell, bringing a number of spider-nemeses from various alternate metaverses. Adherence to contemporary ethos (and Disney family values) is painfully evident as we are told that the supervillains aren't really bad and that the goal should be to cure them (which apparently is pretty easy), not eliminate them (always a challenge) - time to defund The Avengers and assemble a team of super-social-workers instead. I suspect that script, like the unbearably plucky characters, are targeting the 'tween crowd, but I found the 'humour' to be painfully juvenile, especially the antics of Parker's friend Ned (Jacob Batalon), which were tiresome from the moment he appeared on screen. The central premise (about which, to avoid spoilers, I won't elaborate) is interesting at a number of levels but the movie is far too long for the story it tells (the script writer seems to have been paid by the word). I also found the abrupt jumps between pathos and levity jarring (cry for the tragic death of a major character then cut to further Ned/MJ buffoonery).

",This movie has great moments on it. Having all the bad guys from previous Spider-Man movies was fun and made for some great moments. The reasonings for all of this made little to no sense. After getting outed as Spider-Man Peter Parker upends the lives of his best friend Ned and his girlfriend MJ. For some reason he thinks changing this event would help his friends go back to normal and goes to Dr. Strange to make this happen. Well because Spider-man is an insecure mess he messes up the spell due to the fact that Peter Parker can't make up his mind. This causes people from other worlds to come to his such as Green Goblin and Electro. For some reason Peter Parker wants to save all of these people and lets them loose with dire consequences. That part made no sense to me. Why save the nemesis of Spider-man? The fact Tobey Mcguire and Andrew Garfield are in this movie made it more fun. The ending was just stupid and made no sense to me. How does changing the fact that no one knows he's spider-man alter his relationsihps with Ned and MJ. They knew him from school so that shouldn't have changed. I was dissapointed by this movie.

Luckily, that vision was held by director Jon Watts who became the first and only director to direct the entire trilogy at MCU. My conclusion is that this film for the Spiderman franchise is roughly what Endgame is for the Avengers. A movie with big stakes, lots of action and lots of characters. It lasted two and a half hours, but at no point was it boring. It was definitely made for the fans because it has a lot of scenes and references to the franchise, perhaps this is best seen by the initial reactions and reviews that are extremely good and the ratings that are currently perhaps too high for a film like this.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

","This is the most ambitious Spiderman of the Tom Holland series. That being said, it really didn't go far enough. There wasn't much sense of adventure or exploration of the plot line. (Although the all too breif Dr. Strange sequence was great.) Given the plot, it really seems like a missed opportunity. The animated ""Into The Spiderverse was a much better film. I'd even argue Far From Home did a better job at portraying a world with a larger scope and sense of possibility. That movie made an attempt at establishing emotional connections between Peter and MJ, Peter and Mysterio and the other supporting cast. This third installment really just relys on the story establoshed in the previous films. It lacks any emotional development, despite moments in the movie that should of had a large emotional impact. The jokes weren't even very funny. The entire film just felt unfinished. Toward the end of movie, during what is supposed to be the big finale, you can basically see the dimensions of the green screen/warehouse they are filming in. Maybe the film suffered because of lockdown restrictions, who knows. I wish Sony would just let Marvel make 100% of these movies( although to be fair they have made some flops) It just seems like a waste of a very talented cast. At least we have Peter in the MCU to look forward too.

Maguire's films were okay with 2 being the better one. Garfield's first was stellar with a darker tone & two far better leads but second was over long & a badly written Electro. Harry & his Goblin were impressive. While I enjoyed Holland's 2 films, (loved him in Civil War too) I thought they felt a little commercial & lacking the darker tone of Garfield's. No Way Home has an absolutely AMAZING cast with a really first rate storyline. While the film is long, it is very engaging. Dafoe was unreal as Osbourne, bringing many surprises. Molina was his usual outstanding self as Ock. Foxx was fantastic as Electro and Ifans was impressive as his slimy alter ego, The Lizard. Maguire & Garfield were an absolute delight, I feel as though they were very happy to don the costumes again. This is a movie I will see again in the Cinema.

","Spider-Man: No Way Home has not only changed the MCU as we know it, but it has changed the comic book movie genre as we know it. After the events of Spider-Man: Far From Home, Tom Holland returns once more as Peter Parker/Spider-Man after having his identity revealed to the world and dealing with the consequences. Peter starts to struggle to live is day to day life with everyone knowing who he is while everyone around him pays the price. When he turns to Doctor Strange for help and a spell goes wrong, Peter must puts everything aside and learn what it truly means to be Spider-Man. This is hands down my favorite movie to ever come from the MCU and definitely one of the greatest superhero movies ever made. Tom Holland really gives it his all as Peter Parker/Spider-Man for the end of the HOME Trilogy, learning what he truly means to be Spider-Man. Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange as the mentor in this movie was the perfect choice and probably my personal favorite out of all the mentors in the HOME trilogy. His character brings us some of the best elements in this movie, bringing us to new heights we haven't yet seen in the MCU until now. The relationship with Peter and MJ made me feel and care for these two characters more than I have ever cared about for two characters in the MCU before. I really felt and cared for these two characters and the fact that their together in real life to makes me feel even more for the two. Ned was definitely the comic relief character and showed us a side of his character we haven't seen until now either. Jon Favreau's Happy Hogan and Marisa Tomei's Aunt May were great supporting characters too, with Aunt May bringing us some of the best lines of the entire film. Now it's time to start with the Villains, starting with Willems Dafoe's Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. He is absolutely terrifying in this outing as the Green Goblin bringing us a new terrifying side we never saw in Sam Rami's Spider-Man trilogy. His performance in this movie makes him one of my favorite, if not my own personal favorite villain to come to the MCU.. Alfred Molina as Doctor Otto Octavius was one of my favorite characters of the whole movie, also bringing us a side of his character we haven't seen before and one of the most interesting characters of the entire film. Jamie Foxx's Max Dillion Electro, Thomas Haden Church's Flint Marco/Sandman and Rhys Ifans Doctor Connors/Lizard were great additions as the other villains. Some of the choices for their characters I felt wasn't used the best as I hoped they wouldn't of been, but with so many other things going on in this movie, it's hard to keep up with everything else going on with the characters too. Especially with the way the room is paced. The two characters I was glad to see the most though was both Andrew Garfield's and Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker/Spider-Man's. Andrew Garfield definitely stole the show in every single scene he is in and Tobey Maguire brought us a side of his Spider-Man that was new and thrilling. What I was glad the most though with both of these characters was, I felt the MCU finally brought us as fans justice and what we've always wanted for both of these characters for years and I think the MCU executed that perfectly. Another character I was glad to see was Charlie Cox's Matt Murdock make is debut in the MCU letting fans know that Daredevil is coming. I'm a huge fan of the Netflix series and now that he is officially playing the character of in the MCU is a dream come true. One of my only takeaways from the film was Tom Hardy's Venom wasn't used as fans thought he would be intended to be used, but sets up what might be to come in the MCU moving forward. Overall, Spider-Man: No Way Home delivers the promises it's made to fans by making not only one of the best MCU films we have gotten, but one of the best comic book movies of all time.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

","12/28/2021: To me, it was Into The Spiderverse, the live version. I left the theater feeling something strange that I haven't felt in a while after exiting a movie theater: Joy, excitement, happiness, and satisfaction. No preachy annoying character, no grandstanding speech and no politics. This is my first time seeing Tom Holland as Spider-Man. I grew up on Toby Mcguire's Spider-Man and saw the second Andrew Garfield movie. I wasn't a fan of Garfield as Spider-Man in his film, but I absolutely loved him in this movie. You could see his redemption arc coming, but it still hits you in your heart. This movie strikes a balanced tone and the emotional moments paid off because I cared about every single character. The villains were incredible! Willem Dafoe steals every scene he's in and deserves award consideration. The scene where the Green Goblin stops Tom Holland's Peter Parker's plan to save the villains by erasing their powers was so intense, I think I stopped breathing. Doctor Strange was brutally true that one's fate is their fate and Aunt Mae paid the ultimate price because Spider-Man ignored that fact. Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Holland have great chemistry! Thank you to the screenplay writers and cast for giving the fans an unforgettable Spider-Man experience. All three of the Spider-Man actors sharing scenes was surreal. It was a wild, action-packed, well-acted, well-directed experience with a well-earned bittersweet ending, and the Doctor Strange visual effects were amazing. Watching the villains disappear as Doctor Strange's spell-to-erase-Spiderman-from-memories unfolds and watching Spider-Man say his goodbyes was heartbreaking. What a cinematic experience!

Aunt May's death was heartbreaking and was the true shocking moment in the film. In my opinion, Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin was better in this film then he was in Spider Man (2002). I mean cmon, Tom Holland tried to kill him for gosh shake. I remember when people were saying like ""oh this movie will suck cause of too much fan service"" but they were able to add that and add a good story and plot at the same time so that is the really impressive. If it wasn't for Marvel Studios though this movie would be trash! Not only do I think it's the best Spider Man movie but it's also the best movie in Phase 4. If you like Marvel and Spider Man watch this movie like right now on Starz or whatever.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

","This movie does it all, it's not just a spectacle appreciated by geeks of the culture, but it's also an emotional journey of peter parker himself. Regardless of the big baddies in the film, Peter Parker is still the man the story revolves around and it truly is a spider-man film because it manages to reflect on the consequences of a superhero's leaked identity. The film is also incredibly fast-paced with things happening every minute; there was never a moment where I felt that the film failed to entertain me, and as you would expect from a marvel picture there were a lot of good jokes including some only a true fan would get. Overall this movie hits it home in every aspect, all though certain things feel rushed, it just makes the movie all the more action-packed.

Shortly after, Goblin shows and one thinks the fun is about to kick up and this would free Octavius to fight again. Nope, the scene cuts immediately to Octavius being caught and Goblin roaming free. Very sloppy writing and editing. Furthermore, Tobey was not used enough and was portrayed as an old Spider-Man who is basically talking the whole time without any real emotion. Obviously the script was not good enough or he wasn't given enough screen time to care to show his real acting chops. Moreover, the movie focused on the terrible acting ability of the young actors making terrible smart ass jokes which are not funny to anyone over the age of 18. Too many problems in this movie.

Jon Watts does a fantastic job meshing all of the elements together, keeping it focused, creating good pace, not causing a convoluted mess like so many films that try to have so many elements meshed. I liked also that they kept the MCU humor to a minimum, which I don't mind the humor, it's just got to be used in the correct movie.

Sadly, the movie doesn't do enough that is new to stand out from the rest of Marvel's mediocre catalog. The movie is well acted but the story is a lot more convoluted than it needs to be, it contains too many lame attempts at humor which cheapen the emotional moments that they oh so desperately fish for. Why would MJ and Ned not activate Strange's device after Peter fails to help the villains? The whole movie doesn't happen if these two had just made this easy decision. While I like the idea of getting all the classic villains in one movie, at times it feels like too many cooks. If you are getting Willem Dafoe you better give him more the ten lines.

This movie was literally made for the fans, the fan service in the movie was unlike any other. No Way Home was the most hyped movie for such a long time and the fact that it still is shocks me! When watching the movie in the theatres, the experience was so wild as the cast of the movie was nothing more than pure brilliance. Tom Holland got his trilogy but including in Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield who have played Spider-Man in the past literally had me standing the whole time! The plot was so simple but it had so much impact on the storyline of the MCU until now and how they were dealing with it made me feel like I was in the movie. My emotions all mixed up with sadness, happiness, excitement, and the film being very believable had exceeded everything I was hoping for. This movie had some of the best visuals ever seen in the MCU and the work put in hiding the cast from the world was a very hard task as it was meant to be a Christmas surprise to the world. As a Spider-Man fan from my childhood this story gave me so much closure as a fan as he was one of the very few superheroes all kids knew back in the day. Bringing back all 3 actors who have played Spider-Man really shocked the world and probably one of the biggest surprise and gift any fan would have gotten. Filled with so much action, romance, comedy at the perfect moments in the movie was mind-blowing and well planned. Experience this movie with friends increases the level of amusement you get as you get to be so grateful that you have shared such a wonderful movie in the theatres with them. A really well made origin story for Tom's Version of Spider-Man and the amount of work and effort he put in as an actor shows in the movie. This applies to Tobey who hasn't played Spider-Man since 2007 and Andrew from 2014.

As they say, be careful of what you wish for. Dr. Strange has some unkind words to say about Parker in the aftermath of this but what's that saying about people who live in glass houses? Did Peter subject the good Doctor to peer pressure to get what he wanted? Did Strange want to be one of the ""cool kids"" by giving Peter what he wanted?

Also,Big big kudos to Tom Holland and his outstanding performance ; he showed a ton of emotion and was natural with his voice and movement.

","The MCU Spiderman is by far one of the best interpretations of the Spiderman franchise however out of every movie this Peter Parker has been in, this is weakest by far. Let's start off with the good things before getting into the bad
Of course the acting is great as always, as well as the CGI. The way the Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire Spidermen are introduced is fun and Ned obtaining magic is a cool concept, although I think they could play around with it more (and hopefully they do eventually)
However, the plot feels like it's being forced. Peter is much more gullible than the past two movies made him to be, and he's irritatingly good, and when he suddenly snaps to try and kill the green goblin it's just so annoying and borderline character assassination until they finally give back his character near the end. The death of Aunt May was predictable at this point, and I wish they kept her alive as that would've been way more surprising. The plot was entirely preventable if Peter had just not screwed with the spell even when Doctor Strange warned him not to, and it just feels like they hit a test reset button on Peter and made him stupider. Overall the movie is okay, but the writing on Peter's character just destroyed it from being better.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

They were sent rejection slips because they knew Spiderman. Peter goes to Dr. Strange and asks him to do a spell to make everyon forget Peter Parker is Spiderman. The spell was done incorrectly and people who knew Peter Parker Spiderman in other universes were brought into Tom Holand's universe. The orignal plan was to just send the Villains who knew Spiderman back to the other universes where their spiderman is supposed to kill them.

2053,22 December 2021,charbelelaro,7," No Way Home was just a really fun and enjoyable celebration of the character
","Spider-Man: No Way Home is directed by Jon Watts, and is easily one of my most anticipated movies of the year. The secrecy, speculation and uncertainty, made going into this film a truly exciting experience. However I made sure to keep my expectations at a reasonable height, as I personally haven't been the biggest fan of the last two instalments. Walking out of this film I felt very satisfied. This is easily my favourite performance from Tom Holland in this role. I didn't expect the movie to be as mature as it was. He didn't do that annoying fast talking whiney voice, and he actually had substantial growth in the movie. It was seriously about time... The return of past villains was great to see. I loved seeing Alfred Molina and Willem Defoe in scenes together. It was incredible to see them play these characters again, and they did such a fantastic job. It honestly made my year seeing Willem Dafoe kill it as the Green Goblin again. Personally, this was the first film in the series that actually felt like a Spider-Man movie. The villain's motives weren't centred around Iron Man, and Peter Parker finally had to deal with some serious hardship. We see Peter use his intelligence to solve problems in order to protect his loved ones and that finally made me start to care about his character. As for negatives, yeah the movie has a few. I've always felt Jon Watts has never done anything unique on a visual level in these movies. They always look as though they fit comfortably within the basic MCU aesthetic. I also felt the movie was begging for an energetic score, and Giacchino's music really fell short for me. The writing is another issue I had. This made characters like Norman Osborn (and others), feel strangely off, due to some of their lines of dialogue. The movie has pacing issue, as well as an inconsistent tone at times. Also new abilities that were randomly introduced for a character in the film and it made me scratch my head. So looking at this film amongst all the other Spider-Man movies we've gotten over the years, this probably won't rank within my top 3, just purely based on the level of writing/filmmaking, which still doesn't compare to the Raimi films, and Into the Spider-Verse in my opinion. However for me, No Way Home was just a really fun and enjoyable celebration of the character, which is pretty much what I had hoped for.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

Holland is the biggest mistery of the whole Marvel franchise for me. How could a person with such an arid charisma become one of the main characters? Besides, when talk about the movie, Peter's experience and reliability are hugely disproportional to his recklessness and self-confidence, which is very annoying, because the whole story of Spider-Man (which is a cool theme park as the rest of Marvel movies) turns into a very childish fantasy, which in turn forces me to skip Spider-Man movies despite other characters of the Marvel Universe appear there as well. Asking to ditch Holland in favor of a more interesting actor is way too late, unfortunately, and this is really sad.

","I wasn't expecting much from Tom Holland's 3rd spiderman movie but boy was I wrong! It had my full attention from start to finish especially in the 2nd half. Dr. Stephen Strange role in this film opens up opportunities for more interesting, creative storytelling. The multiverse aspect of the story was very well written. I love how Marvel Studios pays tribute to the earlier spiderman movies by featuring Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield and the villains in them with a new spin. Chemistry among the characters were engaging. Dialogues were funny and witty. Benedict Cumberbatch's performance excellent as always! So much interesting spin in this one.

","It's a good movie, there is no arguing that. But is it that good? I myself don't think so. The movie does not, in my opinion, offer any thrills or drama beyond those of its predecessors in the series. The simultaneous introduction of all the heroes (spiders!) and villains from the previous installments, while definitely interesting, did take away some of the charm of each one of them, as focus and attention were divided and none was really the focus of the movie. I also don't like the fact that Spiderman of the current world, and his friends, are all teenagers, and I speculate here that that might have shifted the interest to vote to the related age group of viewers, which seems as such to be also the most taken with this latest presentation of the verse. Dr. Strange contributed significantly to the movie, and introducing him into the spider verse spiced the atmosphere in a nice way. The title of the movie suggests some sort of problem going back home, but that's not the case in the movie, not in that default sense. Previous characters get pulled from their home verse and into the current world, but there was no issue sending them back home in the sense of hardship or inability, and it was rather answering the question of whether they should or shouldn't be sent back that stirred a dispute between Spiderman and dr. Strange and things then evolved.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

","Filled with great moments; this film unfortunately gets bogged down by a perceivable fan service. This film entry into the Spider-Man mythos feels odd. It's a fun set up and premise but the actions seem uncharacteristic to a degree. Dr Strange for example wouldn't act so irrationally and out of his depth succumbing to impractical prepubescent whims. ""It's a shame your secret identity is out but let's straighten this out without resorting to the mystic arts"". The story seems too complicated when dissected. This is a convenient plot to appease fans of all the Spider-man films and personas and to give a more pleasurable finality all those professionally involved in the iconic franchises both separately and as a whole.

There was certainly no new news to what we expected from this film, in that almost every fan theory was precisely calculated, as well as knowing how we were going to expect a thrill ride of an adventure, and No Way Home is definitely no stranger to forcing you to eye the screen with your full concentration for the entirety of the runtime.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

2091,20 March 2022,CosmeticFilms,9," A Fitting End To The ""Home"" Trilogy
","A phenomenal tribute to the live-action character of Spider-Man. Spider-Man: No Way Home is a movie that pushes Tom Holland's Peter Parker to his limits while also teaching him the most iconic lesson: with great power, there must also come great responsibility. Pros: The touching moments between Peter, MJ, and Ned depict the growth and firmness of their friendships on and off-screen. The inclusion of past Spider-Man franchises' characters brings a nice ending to their stories (or maybe not for certain characters) while also helping progress Tom Holland's Peter Parker. The fanservice in the movie is used well and should not discredit the movie in any means. The emotional scenes throughout the movie help highlight the weight on Spider-Man's shoulders and how his decisions have consequences. By the end of the movie, the audience realizes that Tom Holland's Peter Parker trilogy is his origin story, with Peter Parker becoming the true embodiment of Spider-Man: a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Cons: The CGI/visual effects are sometimes spotty. In theatres, the CGI at times was noticeably bad. HOWEVER, as I mentioned earlier, the emotional scenes in the movies are a big highlight to Peter's journey and the way the scenes are shot adds to the emotion. The obvious detail that was spent on these shots is very noticeable and different compared to other less visually appealing and lacking scenes. Watching at home, Marvel's DVD/streaming release of No Way Home has had finishing touches done, and the mistakes from the theatre release have been fixed. Summary: No Way Home is a perfect resolution to the ""Home Trilogy"", and Marvel fans should be excited for what is to come for the character.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

","Wow I loved every part of this movie. This is an example of mixing generations perfectly. Spiderman first came out when I was in my mid teens and I loved it. Then 2 obviously and so on. Then obviously the amazing Spider-Man then Tom Holland's Spider-Man. I never viewed any competition between them I suppose everyone from each generation has their own Spiderman. Now when I heard that do - was coming back from the original Spider-Man 2 I was amazed because he was awesome. Then I found out about the original green goblin from the first and I was like wow really, cool. But then I started to wonder how this was going to be done. Because in movies like this you usually get a ten minute cameo and then the movie moves on. They market the movie with the original but it's just a publicity stunt a way to cash in on nostalgia. So I was a little cautious about seeing this movie because it could have been a disaster in so many ways but it wasn't it was perfect. The older villeins as well as the older Spiderman are absolutely key to the narrative of this movie. This movie is about them and it does it very respectfully but also very thrillingly. Watching this it's almost like three generations haven't passed by at all. They are the same character's they were in the original and they are written in the same and act the same. They all merge together perfectly and work so well it's almost hard to believe. Managing to get three generations of movies together to share the screen and still hold their own in their own right is phenomenal. To the people who made this from the writers to the directors to the star's I say thank you. This movie has now set a bar and it's a high bar. The mixing of generations of hero's and their world's si going to become the next big faze among these types of movies. You have shown them how it should be done. I also want to say that all three of the Spider-Mans got on great but I really enjoyed the chemistry between Tobie McGuire and Andrew Garfield I'd love to see them back again. I also have to acknowledge that this has a lot to hand to the success of Spiderman into the spiderverse thank you for that.

","Homecoming and far from home were nice, but this one... This film is based on a script that looks like it was written by a 7 years old boy, with the difference that a 7 years old boy would've written it better. Feige is great because he understood that MCU fans just want to see all the characters they love, without even the necessity to write a plot consistent with previous films, or even a plot that isn't stupid. I've never seen so many nonsense, plot holes, and such flat characters in my life. Tobey Maguire didn't even believe it while acting. Why didn't Dr Strange use the memory spell to make Thanos forget about the obsession for the destruction of half the universe in previous films? Then electro changing color, haircut and overalls, because ""the energy of this dimension is different"". I don't understand why Lizard is made with such a horrifying cgi. I don't understand why Strange became so naive and stupid... first he makes that very dangerous spell that he didn't make 2 or 3 films before to stop Thanos; then he gets fooled by a child because he's good at math. For the rest of the film it is completely discarded, that's how well the character is treated. They rejuvenated Willem Dafoe with CGI instead Tobey Maguire was left natural. There are characters from different dimensions who are not even presented but recognize each other. Anyway, the plot is the same of a 90s video game: go get the bad guys and put them inside these cages (yes, they even send MJ to get them). Then randomly Osborn manages to recreate the famous green serum. Tobey Maguire is stabbed on the finale by Goblin and looks like he dies, but then, for no reason, he gets well right away. And there are many other problems with this movie but I'm tired and I think I showed what I was interested in demonstrating. By now you can give people the worst stuff ever created , but if you throw in disconnected and meaningless elements, but that they adore, then you got them.

The character deaths were heart-wrenching and beautifully executed, and the teasers we got for the next spider-man trilogy and Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness in the post-credit scenes made me very excited for the next phase of Marvel (and especially how this movie may interact with the Disney Plus shows).

","**MAJOR SPOILERS** The movie was phenomenal with so many call backs to past films and it was the perfect fan service film! I truly wish it was longer because it is sheer gold. I hope we get to see Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man again somewhere down the line. For all those people complaining about Tom Holland's Peter Parker/Spider-Man, this movie quells all those complaints. This is a high stakes high octane adrenaline rush of a roller coaster with so many ups and downs! Spidey goes through the absolute most in this! We get shades of the Sinister Six in this film without the film feeling bogged down by the sheer number of characters. I wish that Mysterio had shown up again as a villain to take his rightful place in the six, but hey, maybe in the future!. I love how each character got to say lines from the past and the movie was over all very funny and entertaining. Some of my favorite quips were Doctor Octopus saying ""the power of the Sun in the palm of my hands"", the Green Goblin saying ""I'm something of a scientist myself"", and Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker complaining about his back problems. I also love how Andrew Garfield Spider-Man got a second chance to save a Spider-Man love interest from falling to her death. This was such a beautiful movie and I can't believe they actually showed the spider sense like how it is depicted in the comics in a live-action film. I marked out so many times and I was paying attention to everything. I even noticed that on that van they had a tribute to Steve Ditko as they graffiti his name on the side of it. The fact that they had Aunt May say the ""with great power, there also must come great responsibility"" line straight out of the comics gave me chills! And the fact that they had the Classic Spiderman costume color scheme at the end! This movie was totally awesome and I can't wait to watch it 100 more times! When the three Spider-Men share the screen, it is every bit as iconic as we all imagined it would be! Such chemistry, and such an amazing, spectacular and ultimate superhero movie! Only Spider-Man 2 can boast about being so good of a Spider-Man movie. This movie, in my opinion, is right next to Infinity War and Endgame in scale and execution.

However, what was special in my opinion was that Marvel optimized the use of the Multi-Verse. What made the whole movie a little more intriguing was the usage of Multi-Verse. I've watched all the Spider-Man series and am more or less quite familiar with the stories of the villains. Having a new concept called the Multi-Verse makes viewers look at Marvel as an organisation that's very creative, even though I believe there was such thing as that in the comics. Whatever it is, I believe having the Multi-Verse is a great platform or an edge to produce better films. However, overusing the Multi-Verse concept may arise the sense of ennui between viewers. Moving on, the cinematography were quite basic just like most Marvel films. The plot and storyline of NWH was quite interesting, as mentioned above, due to the use of Multi-Verse. Of all the actors, Willem Dafoe performed the best among all of them. Next, having three Spider-Men actually makes the film a little awkward at the end as there was no chemistry between them, not like between Tom Holland, Zendaya and Jacob Batalon - they had great chemistry as they were together since the first. Overall, the movie was what I expected and having to rate it a 7/10 was quite impressive for an almost mediocre Marvel film.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

I liked them as a kid but i was never a huge Spider-Man fan. I watched every Tobey Maguire Movie with my father and enjoyed them to. I liked Tom Hollands Spider-Man as well especially in ""Far from Home"". I saw the trailers and i was scared that it would be to much. And i was right. The film is pure fan-service. The film felt as if marvel made an opinion poll and made everything the fans told them to do. The basic idea of the film is weird. Characters as Dr. Strange , which is my Marvel Favorit hero, behaved out of character and stupid. I didn't enjoy the first half of the film at all. Everything seemed so forced and rushed. Then after the big reveal that every Spiderman was in the film I enjoyed the film for a bit, even if it was to much. I didn't enjoy the end. Again everything felt stupid, rushed and way to easy. Most of the villains were boring and had absolutely no impact on the movie. I want to tell you to the thing that annoyed me most: The ""Ned is a Magician"" plot. I think that it is unnecessary and stupid. Why and how does he learn this so fast? Why was it never even teased in other movies? But it was not all bad. I felt entertained but that is just not enough for me. There where also a few outstanding aspects. I really liked William Dafoe's acting. The special effects where amazing.

It brings back five of the key villains and the two Spider-Mans from the previous non-MCU films. And it is not just a last minute gimmick: they are an essential part of the plot. It's great, even for someone like myself who isn't a big Spider-Man fan. Especially Dafoe and the returning Spideys impress. But the MCU Spidey regulars don't disappoint either! Tom Holland is good as always. Not just in the comedy or athletic parts (though he excels there) but he does a solid job in the more dramatic scenes as well. Everyone is performing a great act but I especially like the quirkiness of Zeydana. She is a natural beauty and a amazingly relaxed actress. But...for an average film lover the film on itself isn't that fantastic. Take away all the cool fan services and what remains is only a more than adequate superhero film.

Firstly this film could and perhaps should have ended after an hour, the notion that spider-man won't let strange sent them back to their universes because they will die at some point is stupid, i get that spider-mans weakness is his morality but really that's what you're going to do. Secondly the fan service of this film is too in your face, yes it's great to hear Willem Dafoe say ""I'm something of a scientist myself"" and calling Andrew Garfield's spider-man ""amazing"" in reference to his film franchise but these lines feel forced and shoe-horned in (the interaction between the spider-men is also kinda cringy).",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

I'll give you examples.. The way they introduced Tobey Maguire was so underwhelming. I actually liked how Andrew Garfield made his appearance. The way he came was unexpected. We saw a Spider Man running towards the portal and as soon as he came in, I thought hmmm is this Tom Holland. His costume looks abit different. Then boom he takes his mask off and its Andrew.

The first half is very strong and there is a turning point in tone that I really enjoyed however by around the end of the second act this movie takes a huge dip in quality. It's very obvious the latter portion of this movie was rushed as it feels very half baked. So many plot devices are being thrown at you that the story can't help but feel convoluted and blatant holes in the plot start to set in. Not to mention this movie tone switches like someone who's bipolar. As I said I liked the initial tone switch however it lacked consistency throughout the rest of the film so it made it hard for me to take this movie seriously. This is a competent film and I do think there is an amazing movie buried underneath it's messy plot, I just wish they would've spent more time to really flesh out the narrative they were going for as it would've made the movies ending far more satisfying. I should mention I didn't hate the ending I just felt it didn't feel earned and a very obvious plot hole stuck out to me that made it feel far more disingenuous.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

","I cannot begin to describe how much I loved this movie! It's truly the most excited I've been coming out of a movie in a long time! Jon Watts and the team behind this MCU Spider-Man trilogy have done such a good job delivering some of Spider-Man's best films... but this one truly takes the cake! It's my favourite Spidey film and quite possibly one of my favourite comic book movies in general! Everything it did worked so well for me and exceeded all of my expectations! I was completely blown away! And honestly I hope everyone else is too, which is why I don't want to go into too much detail with this review... it's got so many fantastic surprises in it (that had my theatre's audience cheering) that I don't want to spoil for anyone. To even begin to talk about the movie in depth would take away from such a fun experience, so all I can say is just go watch it yourself! It truly shows why Spider-Man is such a beloved character, and delivers a film that honours everything that has come before while also being a very fitting conclusion to Tom Holland's ""Homecoming"" trilogy! It stuck the landing perfectly, and even I was doubtful that they could do it! It truly impressed me as a fan, and I just loved all the moments of fan-service and how those actually served the narrative in clever ways! I cheered, I laughed, I even cried! It's definitely the most emotional Spider-Man movie out there and the 3rd act is really something special. This one is gonna go down in pop-culture and cinematic history, it's awesome and does things that we've really never seen before! And it has to be said, Tom Holland is truly wonderful as Spider-Man, and shows here how gifted of an actor he really is! It's his best turn as the character to date! I also loved the return of classic villains, but I don't wanna get into specifics about it for spoiler reasons. I loved where the story went and it constantly kept me guessing and kept surprising me, I just was so blown away!! I'm deliriously happy by what this movie delivered, it hit all the right notes, and I cannot wait to see it again! It is without a doubt top tier Marvel; it's so good I don't even believe that it's real! Just go see it, it's astounding!",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

","I'm absolutely captivated. An unbelievable blast for Spider-Man fans. I didn't think Marvel would come up with anything this spectacular after Endgame. The new Spider-Man may not surpass the Avengers in my opinion, but he's damn close on their heels. This was unreal. All three Spider-Men together. Seeing Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man on screen was a dream of mine and this movie made it come true. When he showed up, I thought I was gonna cry. Aside from him, I was very happy to see old familiar bad guys like Goblin and Octopus, who were absolutely excellent. I keep raving about how much I enjoyed the return of familiar faces from the Spider-Man trilogy, but I also have to praise the line of the current one or Tom Holland, which was also wonderful and had some really great moments. What I was very pleasantly surprised by, and actually can't believe, is how much they managed to cram it all into two and a half hours. It's already a longer film, but with a giant cast of characters. It's all very fast-paced here, so I wasn't bored at all and kept getting adrenaline shots. Wordless action. Totally unreal. Famous. I enjoyed it so much. As I mentioned the film is fast paced but despite that there is nothing rushed and I felt like every character had their own space. I don't understand how Marvel does it, but in short, they've proven that they can take bigger bites and do a great job of it, and I'm smiling. This movie had huge potential, no doubt. I was worried it wouldn't live up to it. I'm having a hard time judging it here. I'm slightly disappointed by some things and slightly pleased by others. Some things have been pleasantly surprising, others have been disappointing. In short, I could even imagine some moments that would have been perfect with all three Spider-Men, but unfortunately it didn't happen. On the contrary, there were other moments that I didn't expect and I was very pleasantly surprised and they were really cool. But I think it turned out great and with a few exceptions I'm absolutely satisfied. It's already a longer film and if all the potential was to be used, I really don't know how many hours the film would end up being. But a lot was accomplished in 2 and a half hours, for which I take my hat off. To sum it up. Spider-Man: No Way Home is, in my opinion, one of the best Marvel movies ever made, and for me, a great movie that I recommend.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

","When it came to my favorite MCU movie, I felt that Infinity War could not be beat.

Everything about it is great and beyond anything else in the MCU, bringing a great deal of humor, heartache, and exhilaration throughout the runtime. The film is also darker than I expected, managing to be one of the darkest films in the MCU. Effects were great, story was cohesive and provided great stakes and covered all corners providing a satisfying and well rounded plot, and the acting was top notch. The only flaw I could find is minor in that a certain aspect of the ending proved to be very concerning in how the dynamic of future Spider-Man movies in this universe could change, but I feel that if kept in capable hands, my concerns with subsequent films will be put to rest.

Secondly Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina steal the show much like they did in the first two Spider-Man films.

As for the other three villains Electro is great but Sandman and The Lizard feel unnecessary and do feel thrown in just to build up the excitement for the movie.

","As a fan of Spider-Man since seeing the first movies with Tobey Maguire as a kid I've grown to love the franchise and super heroes ever since. Not only does No Way Home uses every second of the movie to work on Hollands Spider-Man in the MCU connecting him with his villains and villains from both Raimis and Sony's universe. Relationships are formed villains from the past are seen again in a new light the movie is great. The other MCU movies with Holland puts light on him as a teenage Spider-Man but No Way Home tests Peter making the right moral decisions, handling hardships as Spider-Man and as Peter, and then handling tragedy ultimately alone as his final sacrifice puts him further into the shoes of the hero we've grown to love as Spider-Man. When Maguire and Garfield's Spidermen get introduced into the movie it's done so in the most exciting unsuspecting way possible, the entire theatre went crazy and loud. The final battle with the 3 Spidermen had everyone up in their seats as they take a higher route in handling the villains. I couldn't have asked for a better Spider-Man movie and to get closure and loose ends tied to Maguire and Garfield's Peter Parker was a treat in itself. It's hard to choose anything to pick on from start to finish there is never a dull moment this is probably the most fun I've had in a movie theater in forever.

2708,18 December 2021,tomtalbotty,10," Mind blowing phenomenal Spiderman that changes your perception of everything
","This movie changes everything especially your perception of reality as things are not always what they seem. We first start out from where we left of in Far From Home post blip where obviously Mysterio has revealed Spidermans identity of Peter Parker as you do see the initial overwhelming impact especially on Peter and MJ as the news broke as they where in times square as we previously know. We see Peter swinging webs to get both him and MJ out of the crowd and to safety. So tensions run high in the city personifying New York cities residents once again as a character either believing the news from the iconic J. Jonah Jameson, nevertheless it being a either you love him, or you hate him moment in the city appearing 50/50 split. Initially Peter, MJ and Ned are trying to figure out what to do as the news is having massive impact on their lives. So decisions are made by Peter to go to Doctor Strange to try and make everyone all forget apart from the people who already know and that is where we go the rabbit hole there having catastrophic consequences. We obviously see the return of the villains from the past Spiderman universes such as Doctor Octopus, Green Goblin, Electro, Sandman and the lizard kind of making it like a big boss battle for Peter to deal with. Just wondering where our sixth villain is from the sinister six is, nevertheless the villains have a true part to play really creating a pivotal point for them as we know their original fates does not end well. There will be moments in this movie which will leave you emotional as well as funny little gags and lots of nostalgia too. There is epic fight scenes and CGI really complementing the movie and the characters leaving you loving Spiderman even more. We will see Peter coming to several crossroads during this movie that will change reality forever for him and everyone else, therefore he must make the correct decision before it is too late. Overall this movie has been absolutely amazing to watch as it truly changes everything bringing everything together. Seeing Peter and MJ romantic relationship grow as trusting each other is key especially during these tough situations ahead. We do really see MJ and Ned becoming their own heroes as they have been key to helping Peter along the way as if not the wrong decisions could have been made with even more catastrophic consequences, also they help catch the iconic villains too. Well done to Marvel along with the rest and the cast and crew on creating such a phenomenal movie that really has the cinema atmosphere going wild that we have not seen since end game everyone cheering together, laughing, crying etc. Really did add another element to the movie especially for all Spiderman fans out there, this really brought everything together so well leaving us all hyped to what is to come next. I know I said it last time as well, but this is truly the best Spider Man yet my favourite Spider Man Film really bringing everyone together and back into the cinema for this phenomenal experience.

They're in the back of our minds know what's to come there's only a few key minor problems that I really did not like, the only problem that I did not like was the first act where Peter has to go to Doctor Strange to fix all the problems that was caused by Mysterio and letting Mysterio know peters identity. It would've been very intriguing that Peter was the one that casually made a mistake and made the heroes and villains from other Spider-Man universes come to the MCU that he was the one pulling the strings and being active but other than that this was a really find movie they made all the hype and expectations succeed 9/10.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

",Technically the film is good and screenplay too. Screen pace should be more for other two Peter Parker and too emotional made the film little off beat than the rest which worked for few audience but didn't click up for me but the transition of Holland spider man from kid to understand the responsibilities looked like a tribute for entire spider man ever made and its a nostalgia . I didn't like the music in the film which didn't give me the hype like other two spider man. Nostalgia is the pure essence of the film which people are particularly excited for this movie which they should have made more like into the spider verse movie which it definitely lacks. This is the time MCU spider man learns to live his life like other two. So that's the punch which made the climax good. It was good to watch Tobey and Andrew and all swinging together to make everything right which went chaos. William Dafoe was 🔥. Tobey spider man 2 is still the best spider man for me.

Tobey felt like he was there to pick up a paycheck. But Andrew Garfield, he was actually the best Spiderman in this. His character here felt like a natural conclusion to TASM 2, starting with him still mourning Gwen to getting back on his feet and coming to his own as Spiderman again, even getting to talk to and comfort Max after solving the power trip he went on as Electro like he had tried to do in TASM 2. That was the best part of the film. Beyond that, this was basically a Doctor Strange movie that sidelined Doctor Strange for the second act.

Tobey is as solid as ever. What a powerhouse actor Andrew Garfield has become. I hope he is nominated for the Tammy Faye movie but he really puts a lot into this resurrection of his Peter Parker (even though his Spider-Man films were the weakest of the three versions, not at his fault). I hope they don't use the same terrible wig for Benedict Cumberbatch in the next movie, yikes! That's really the worst thing about this movie. It may not be the best written or directed Marvel movie, but it's solid and a heavy hitter on nostalgia and humor, and the acting from the three Peter Parkers gives it the extra edge, especially if you appreciate the multiverse aspect of the story.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

I think Marvel does a really good job of taking the audience from their own universe and putting them into MCU, literally making everyone feel like they live inside the MCU but this time, from start to finish, I felt like a complete viewer. I didn't even feel close to MCU and at one point I started thinking about how they filmed the scenes and rating the actors' acting skills. Long story short the movie did not lure me in at all and I was left with nothing but a bitter taste in my mouth when the movie ended.

It's hard to feel anything for a movie that refuses to acknowledge it's characters as anything other than fan service and plot devices. The movie starts off with the laziest excuse to introduce the multiverse, as if talking while Strange is casting a spell can suddenly open up the multiverse and specifically make certain characters appear. Strange is made to look like an idiot whether it was for is failed spell, or his inability to stop a man doing spider tricks, even his exit sticks out like a sore thumb. The only purpose Electro, Sandman, and the Lizard served were to be the bad guys, when they were so much more. Blindly all 3 of them suddenly agree to following Green Goblin, knowing that he's being controlled, and refuse to take the cure; why? The movie doesn't have an answer so you shouldn't ask. The 3 Spider-Men could have has some great banter, however their screen time went in jokes that didn't land.

I Hope we can see him as spiderman in future too. I don't think tobey will reprise his role as our beloved web swinger but i can understand that. The villains were good but Jamie Fox and William Defoe's performance were absolutely amazing. Other villains were just there didn't had that much impact on the movie in my opinion.

Firstly, just like the Avengers series two other actors Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield are roped in make appearances along with Tom Holland. (This is not a spoiler since their names and characters are mentioned in cast in Google). An interesting scene has all 3 having a chat about their experiences in their respective universes. Sample this "" Did you ever get caught with no more web in your hands ?"" and "" Who was the deadliest enemy you fought ?"". Secondly , how would you feel if your superhero is battered, injured, dejected and down in the dumps ? Or better still can you imagine that Spiderman (or Peter Parker if you like) and his two friends want to join MIT ? The usual set of villains are there and Dr Strange ( Cumberbatch) has his magic powers to help out Spiderman. Also their adventures enhanced with mind blowing special effects are there in plenty. A few one liners placed intermittently do amuse. Spiderman's romantic interest MJ (Zendaya) is around though she is now Michelle Jones not Mary Jane. An evil one liner to remember is "" No good deed goes unpunished"". When all 3 form a team to kick evil ass, one Spiderman complains that he is not used to fight in a team! Fair enough.

The action scenes are great... for the most part, although the final battle is a bit of a mess with quick cuts and A LOT happening. Alfred Molina is great as Doc Ock, but Willem Dafoe utterly steals the show reprising his Green Goblin role, and is even better here than he was in Spider-Man (2002). All in all its all very Marvel formula 101, with amazing effects, some in jokes and a very, very interesting mid-credits scene.

Spiderman, regardless of how bad the movie is, is always going to be my favourite character in Marvel, and I think this film showed how well all 3 actors played Spiderman and deserved their roles.

","No Way Home is everything I wanted it to be. I will admit that I was hesitant about this before the film came out due to the nostalgic elements but it worked beautifully. This film isn't without fault though. Doctor Strange acts out of character here to do the spell for Peter and Ned being really good at making portals before Strange was doesn't make a lot of sense. Sandman says a line that throws a MASSIVE plot hole into Raimi's Spider-Man films. It's very obvious that the filmmakers didn't know what to do with Sandman and The Lizard. They just kinda hang out in the background and unfortunately the actors for them aren't doing a great job. I could really pick apart the plot if I wanted to but this film does so much right that I can't bring myself to do it. Electro is a massive improvement from his appearance in TASM2 and Jamie Foxx is clearly having fun with the role. Alfred Molina's Doc Ock is great and it feels like he hasn't left the role. I'm glad that he stops being a villain halfway through and has a hand in helping the hero's during the final battle. Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin steals the show. He ended up being my absolute favorite MCU villain. Dafoe steps back into his Goblin shoes flawless. His performance can be absolutely terrifying at points. In the apartment scene where he fights Tom Holland, the score becomes incredibly haunting as Holland lands blow after blow while Dafoe laughs manically. It's haunting and amazing. Speaking of the score, it's absolutely fantastic. It adds so much emotion to the story and helps with the grand feeling. The light motifs for each character works brilliantly when thrown into the scene. The biggest strength this film has is the death of Aunt May and the return of Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield's Spider-Men. Aunt May's death came out of nowhere and really hit hard when she dies in Peter's arms. It's a brilliant scene. Tobey and Andrew step back into the suit perfectly with Andrew Garfield being the best part of the film in my opinion. Both of them bring back their quirks of their Spider-Men and they have their own little redemption moments. Tobey saves Goblin from being stabbed by Tom's Spider-Man and Andrew saves MJ from death in an absolutely beautiful scene and brilliant performance from Garfield. It almost made me cry to watch Garfield realize that he had redeemed himself and saved someone but in the end, this is Holland's film and he goes through Hell in this. He loses his aunt and in the end, everyone forgets who he is and it's brilliant. Holland finally shines in his best performance as Spider-Man here. It's heartbreaking to see him go through all of this but in the end, when he loses everyone, he looks on the bright side and continues being Spider-Man. It's what his aunt and friends would want him to do. He makes his own custom suit and swings out to continue being Spider-Man and in that moment, Tom Holland became his own Spider-Man. This film does so much right and I would HIGHLY recommend watching this as soon as possible.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

If nothing else, navigating the different tones of past works while remaining true to the current universe presents a challenge. There were moments that just felt on the nose and silly to me. Also, the difference between the Spider-Man villains from older movies and the ones from Tom Holland's universe really shows.

Spider-Men Trio and Sinister Six are awesome, but due to a substantial amount of trailers and spoilers excavated by avid theory channels, the storyline is mostly predictable. Daredevil and Venom, great; Tom Holland and Zendaya 's kiss, great; ""My back, my back"", great. It's like Marvel's chomping the food into mush and shoving it into our mouths: pure felicity without true understanding of the core purpose of each character. Peter Parker, after fighting vulture, mysterio, and Thanos, should have a clear understanding of responsibility that tails great power, then just randomly decides to welcome supervillains of the multiverse to his house and party? Enough complains, Aunt May's death is a scene that's truly emotional due to the flawless performance of Marisa Tomei, which brings the significance of ""responsibility"" to a personal level for Peter, and is a fateful ending of Spider-Man's parental guardian. Choreography and visual effects are stunning. Can't believe Willem Dafoe, a man in his 60s, could present us with such an intimidating and double-sided Green Goblin.

Should've had Peter do some normal crime fighting like burglers at the start of end like every other iteration because he didn't do it in the other two. Electro was still bad. Doc Ock at the start was sick in the fight but his dialogue was a bit iffy at the start. Tom still needs another movie or two to show he can actually do it on his own,/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

","I really struggle to understand the almost universal praise for this film. I was as excited as anyone to see exactly what they were going to do with the endless possibilities of the film's premise, but I came out of the cinema feeling conned by what I saw as a shameless cash grab by marvel. Almost nothing in this film's already lazily thrown together plot made sense; for instance we were told by dr strange that ""everyone who knows Peter Parker is spiderman"" came through the multiverse. Firstly, why...? The film didn't bother to explain this any further, just offering the justification of ""because magic/ the multiverse"". Secondly, several of the villains that came through didn't even know Peter Parker was Spiderman, as Jamie Foxx's character even admits at the end of the film. But nothing that happened over the course of the exasperating couple of hours of runtime mattered anyway because Dr Strange just did a magic spell to reverse everything. The filmmakers seemed to just think that viewers would blindly accept or just wouldn't notice these gaping plot holes, which is a huge insult to our intelligence. But based on the reception this film got, it seems that marvel correctly estimated the intelligence of the majority of their viewership, expecting the appearance of several beloved characters from previous franchises to send them into such a giddy state that they thought this film was good. And full credit to marvel, it worked. If this kind of lazy writing punctuated by ridiculous meme-bait and popcorn moments is the future of cinema then I think it would have been best if the pandemic had spelled the end for cinema as we know it.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

do what was right to help the villains to become
good but in the end it didn't work for all of them. He has lost more then what we could imagine and that's insane to me. I thought the other two Spider-Mans had worst causes but adding them both still doesn't match Tom holland situation. This was a fantastic
movie, and it really suck that everyone who knew Spider-Man will forget about him and even saving the universe. This is what I find extraordinary about movies like this.

The original Spiderman series was not necessarily well acted but it was iconic and entertaining, while Andrew Garfield's Spiderman went back to the traditional comicbook aspects of the character.

3089,31 December 2021,sambat-65739,5," Fantastic in terms of character
","Spider-Man: No Way Home is both a very good film and also a very bad film. First, the premise to this film is broken, particularly when it comes to the magic used, making the plot wonky in places. It raises many serious questions as to how the magic works and why it hasn't been used in the past to fix things. This is an issue because it seriously hurts the world-building of the MCU. Second, Doctor Strange was not himself in this film. The events that took place were fully his fault. He is not the type of person to simply do something without discussing it with someone else. This would have been acceptable had this film taken place during the movie Doctor Strange when he still had serious flaws (though he would not have been powerful enough to do what he did in this film, so that also wouldn't work), but by Infinity War it is clear he is very much a team player, or in other words, a good communicator. He would have sat down with Peter and discussed things with him before taking action. This misuse of his character began in Endgame and persists throughout most of this movie with the exception of when he says ""Don't!"" to Peter. Finally, I wonder why Wong didn't interfere with the situation, and I have other questions, but these are the main issues. So when you think about it, the premise of this movie falls apart. Now for the characters. Character is the most important part of a movie. If a film doesn't have good character writing, then you won't care about what happens in the story, even if the story makes sense. The director, Jon Watts, clearly understands the characters in this film. Not only are arcs from previous films completed, they are even improved upon. The emotional payoffs are massive and well-earned, and the stakes to this movie feel real. Tom Holland's skills really showed in this film and I didn't mind Zendaya as MJ. She acted like a human. The other actors also did a phenomenal job, and you grow to sympathize with their characters. This movie has an awareness of the real world/meta that is used in a excellent manner. It never comes across as cheap. The stellar characters who are at the heart of this story make this a very satisfying movie. I hope Jon Watts gets the opportunity to direct more Marvel films/shows. He clearly cares deeply about the characters. The rating of 5 does not mean the film failed. The rating of 5 means there are excellent elements to this film, but it is dragged down by very bad elements as well. The number 5 is a general guideline of the film, not a label for everything in it. The world-building is bad, and as a result, the plot is weak. The theme is strong, and the characters are terrific. There are definitely issues, but they still managed to achieve a cohesive central arc/theme throughout all three Spider-Man films, creating the best-realized trilogy in the MCU. This movie has a terrific ending. It completes the journey Peter began in Civil War. I would be happy if it ended here. Peter Parker has learned his lesson and is truly Spider-Man.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

But now, let's just cut to the chase, seeing Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield back in the Spider-Man Roles was emotional and awesome to see on screen, and the applause and cheering that followed was just a dream come true! The Three Spideys Banter together is so fun and enjoyable to see on screen. And even seeing Ned and MJ talk to them was fun!

I am generally a fan of most marvel movies and this movie sits somewhere towards the top(but still not close to the highest tier of Endgame, Infinity War, Guardians 2, Ragnorak). To start, it had an insane amount of fan-service. I went to the theater the day it came out and the theater was clapping and happy the whole time. The only thing about this was that it had sooo much fan service, that the plot suffered a bit. Additionally there were so many different elements that had to be juggled(sinister six), multiverse, dr. Strange, Mj and Ned, and dealing with the returning characters. This led to one of the pitfalls of the original movies' third installment in which too many things were happening, so you didn't really feel as attached or just wasn't memorable.

The movie has a similar vibe to the previous films in the Tom Holland series but there are several very emotional moments. Every character was interesting and some were arguably more interesting than the previous installment they were in. The other spidermen were brought in the film with ease. Everything came full circle with the iconic line ""with great power comes great responsibility"" While I'm not sure if the memory erasing ending completely made sense, the concluding scenes were pretty satisfying, leaving plenty of room for sequels if they want Peter (Tom Holland) to reunite with MJ and Ned. I love Marvel but Spider-Man has never been my favorite character. This movie made me really appreciate each generation of the character.

","I went to see this expecting a typical Tom Holland as Spider-Man movie, I came out wishing the next chapter in his story would come out in a week! There was so much going on in this movie but the directors handled the comedy and seriousness well. Although some said the lines were forced I believe this movie was funny for a marvel movie. Although Aunt May dying on screen was something of a shock, and seeing Tom Holland's Peter Parker go on a rampage against Green Goblin was a little scary, the movie was mostly positive. Don't get me wrong those scenes were necessary for the plot, they were just something to behold in a movie trilogy usually so upbeat. Also the pairing up of the Spider-Men was epic. Like I can't see any scenario we're they could have made it better. And the end of it all, Peter (Holland) is just a nobody. Because he chose to be Spider-Man, he chose to give up his life to help others, he gave up his friendships and love life as Peter Parker to be a full time Spider-Man. His down-to-earth suit in the end marks the transition from techy Iron Man inspired Peter as Spider-Man to a Friendly neighborhood vigilante crime fighter who wants to do what's right. And that is who Spider-Man is no matter which actor of comic rendition. Thank you for reading my honest opinion of this great movie.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

While that thrillingly inventive animation remains the standout film from the Spider-canon - it's a sleek, conceptually elegant thing compared to No Way Home's cluttered, more-is-more approach - here, director Jon Watts harnesses the idea of the ""multiverse"" (an infinite number of parallel universes, each with their own Spider-Man) and satisfyingly puts it to work in the service of a live-action version of the spider saga.

","Entry three in the Tom Holland Spiderverse continues where the last left off, immediately in fact. Not just in terms of story, but it carries over similar issues with an abundance of narrative messiness, tonal shifts and a feeling that the film is shoehorning too much into the mixer. I enjoyed the first entry due to the relative simplicity and a focus on Parker's everyday teen struggles. Holland was okay, if a little lacking in charisma, but as an on screen Parker, he was probably the most accurate depiction. He just lacked the nuance of Garfield and Maguire. By the second film, subtlety was thrown by the wayside, the jokes overwhelm the drama and No Way Home begins in the very same way. A beginning that should have Parker in a state of shock and anguish, his world torn apart, is loaded with silly gags which do disservice to the drama. This continues throughout the film.

","What an incredible achievement this movie is. Exhilerating and entertaining 2:30 hours. This movie is for a true comic book fans, especially those of Spider Man and Marvel comics. Tom Holland, brilliantly donning the Spidey mask again appearing more unprepared and learning to be a responsible Spider Man in the way with the help of MJ(terrific Zendaya) and Ned and additional help from Dr. Strange himself. Sinister 5 portrayed by original actors gives you joy and nostalgia every second of their appearance this time with an additional secret seasoning from Watts. Best of the lot is Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin who seemed to have enjoyed the role as much he did in the first movie. Goblin is more sinister and terrifying this time and Dafoe just aced it. The time you get to see what we have been waiting all along,just gives you pure joy. There were gut punching scenes as well when the loss of a beloved character and the teary good byes of the trio.

3496,19 December 2021,aliahussain-37647,10," A Love Letter To Spider-Man Fans
","This movie was outstanding. From the first minute of the movie, it starts off strong, continuing immediately after the events of Far From Home. Cameos from Charlie Cox's Matt Murdock and Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock - Venom - only made the movie a more fun experience. The story Jon Watts told with this movie showed his incredible directing, with brilliant story-telling, and an even better cast. This movie really brought together three generations' worth of Spider-Man fans perfectly. I've watched the movie twice as of 19/12/2021, and I can't find a single flaw. It is without a doubt my favorite movie of all time, even topping The Dark Knight. The only problem I had with that movie was that the action seemed a bit forced, whereas in Spider-Man: No Way Home, the action is the best I've ever seen in a movie. I've never seen a theater scream and clap louder in celebration of a specific event happening in a movie, in this movie's case, the returns of Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire, who all played their roles perfectly. I loved how all three Spider-Men established their differences and had enough screen time for viewers to be satisfied with. Even the humor in this movie is on-point, from Zendaya's MJ, Jacob Batalon's Ned Leeds, Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange, to really everyone else in this movie, who all had the theater laughing. A lot of actors in this movie deserve awards for performances like these. Alfred Molina played Otto Octavius with as much consistency as we could have wished for, as if he had just played Doctor Octopus in Spider-Man 2 yesterday, one wouldn't think there was a 17-year wait in between. Jamie Foxx's Max Dillon really stole the show in almost every single scene that he featured in, truly redeeming Electro from that wasted performance in The Amazing Spider-Man 2. J. K. Simmons reprised his role as J. Jonah Jameson perfectly, showing his hate towards Spider-Man. You'd think Simmons was the real version of Jameson from how he knocked his role out of the park. Tom Holland, just wow. You can tell how much he's improved as an actor over the years. His acting is so good, you can hardly believe this was a fictional story - similar to Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire's acting in this movie. But most importantly, Willem Dafoe's performance in this movie was one of the best I've ever seen in my entire life - how he switched between playing a sad, old, and scared Norman Osborn, to playing a creepy, suspenseful, and evil mastermind in the Green Goblin, Dafoe absolutely crushed it and perfected the role. His acting was so good, it rivals Heath Ledger's Joker in my opinion, which for a long time, I believed to be the best cinematic performance of all time. Crazy to think its been 19 years since Dafoe last played Green Goblin, and he played it much better than he did in the original Spider-Man. According to my understanding of a few things I've read on the internet, Thomas Haden-Church and Rhys Ifans weren't available during filming and only had voice roles in this movie, and how the movie still continued to feature the Sandman and the Lizard without their actors is incredible, crazy to believe even the few seconds Flint Marko and Curt Connor's showed up in human form was re-used footage from Spider-Man 3 and The Amazing Spider-Man. In my opinion, the 15 seconds of swinging from all 3 Spider-Men just before the final battle to cure all the villains were the greatest 15 seconds in Marvel cinematic history. As a huge Spider-Man fan, I have been talking about this movie non-stop every single day to everyone I know for months, awaiting its release. Expectations were at an all-time high, unrealistically high, yet this movie still managed to EXCEED my exceptions. This movie consistently had me on the edge of my seat, even with its ending, which made me view its predecessors, Spider-Man: Homecoming and Spider-Man: Far From Home, differently. This trilogy truly encapsulated Spider-Man's origin perfectly, from having everything to having nothing - a true coming of age story. This movie was an emotional rollercoaster, from having me worried about what would happen next with Peter's identity reveal, relieved about the charges being dropped, excited with all the villain returns, sad and tearing up with Aunt May's death, on the edge of my seat with Tobey and Andrew's returns, tearing up in happiness with Andrew's redemption as he caught MJ, scared when seeing Tobey get stabbed, and then relieved with Tom's Spider-Man doing the right thing in the end, even though it meant Peter Parker had to lose in order for Spider-Man to win. Even the editing in this movie was fantastic, even for companies as big as Disney, Marvel, and Sony developing this movie together, the editing and CGI were consistently spectacular. I loved the new showcasing of Spider-sense, the battle against Dr. Strange in the Mirror Dimension, and every other scene of this movie that required editing. This is without a doubt a love letter to every Spider-Man fan, and the greatest movie I have ever watched, truly felt like an honor to have the privilege to see this in theaters. I 100% believe that this is not only the best Spider-Man movie of all time, not only the best Marvel movie, not only the best Comic Book movie, but THE greatest movie of all time.

","Hilarious, emotional and exhilarating, this movie was an absolute pleasure to watch from beginning to end. Jon Watts directs what will surely become one of the most celebrated Marvel films ever to be put to picture with a story that will have fans, of old and new, gushing over all of the returning characters to this universe bringing an almost Captain America: Civil War feel to the grandness of this movie. The entire cast is exceptional in this film with every single character reprising their original roles all the way back from the first spider-man starring Toby Maguire in 2002. Unlike some movies where reintroducing old characters can seemed forced and unnatural Spider-man: No Way Home flawlessly integrates these characters into a universe that has been built to make such a story feel possible if not inevitable. Endless jokes are sprinkled through almost every scene surrounded by dialogue that is consistent of past marvel productions with most of the punchlines and awkward silence gags hitting the mark. Visually we endure a pummeling of well executed action scenes with there also being dozens of well placed easter eggs to keep your eyes open for. This movie feels a little longer then the 2hr 20 min runtime to me but not necessarily in a bad way. The pacing of the movie was well crafted and the balance of humor and real hard hitting drama sucks you into the metaverse with Peter Parker for an adventure of massive proportions. Unfortunately the final battle scene felt a little underwhelming and slightly less polished then the rest of the films story building however the ending does a fantastic job of wrapping the film up in a way that hits you right in the feels.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

","So I've finally watched this and there will be NO SPOILERS. As a teenager I was a Big Marvel fan, reading all the comics long before the MCU was born. My 2 favourite superheroes were Spiderman and Doctor Strange. Spidey because he was a teenager and I could relate to a lot of his teenage angst. Doctor Strange for the surreal and amazing imagination and artwork. So this movie was like heaven to me! Tom Holland surely cements himself as the best Spiderman/Peter Parker of all time in this. He is simply sensational and demonstrates every emotion going with total conviction. Benedict Cumberbatch is also perfect as Doctor Strange and we get to see just how powerful he really is. But for me it's Parker's friends and love interest played respectively by Jacob Batalon and Zendaya who are the beating heart of this movie. There is the return of some iconic villains which is brilliantly realised. Marvel are the Gold standard of moviemaking. They excel in every department from script to cast to effects and Direction. This is up there with the greatest superhero movies of all time and certainly the best Spiderman film. Absolutely fantastic from start to finish.

As for No Way Home, wow. Just wow. This is very likely the definitive Spider-Man entry across all franchises. The movie is extremely emotional which is a great change of pace from MCU movies in general as well as on par with the better Spider-Man movies. Not too mention it has a fantastic way of giving us closure for each of our leads despite leaving the future wide open. Paced brilliantly as well, you genuinely feel the tension rise, and fall as the movie goes on. We need more Spider-Man movies like this: supremely emotional with exceptional payoff.

Besides, its all making it this easy to get into MIT, or just to forget everything would save them from not letting them know it tomorrow, or just forgetting someone you love because they made the decision?? It was just a choice, unlike what they called they have no choice. (which is different , from miles morales' situation(from spiderman : into the spider-verse2018)

","Aside from the ""Thor"" strand of Marvel features, the ""Spiderman"" stories were always my favourites. Regardless of the actors encased in red and blue lycra, the character has always had the most to offer - a sense of mischief with his tongue in his cheek. His superpower has always struck me as not being that great either, so there was a need for courage and a certain degree of gung-ho optimism from this most human of super-heroes. This latest iteration is certainly the best. Tom Holland has made the part his own - he even manages to spend the first few scenes in his boxers just to get the audience's attention before a couple of hours of fast-paced, colourful entertainment with one or two (dozen) spikes in the plot to keep it interesting. There is plenty of fun to be had watching this. The dialogue is frequently amusing as are the hammy contributions of Benedict Cumberbatch's ""Dr. Strange"" and a host of stars none of whom are taking anything at all seriously. There is no high-principled moralising, it's just escapism produced to the highest of standards with a lad in a costume who is clearly having a great time making a film that is shameless in it's desire to make us smile (or, indeed, cheer loudly as at my screening in London last week). I can't help but think that three is a bit of a magic number for the actors in the title role. The more we see of Tom Holland in other roles (and the more of him we see!) makes it a just that little bit more difficult for him - as was the case for Messrs.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

","The third part, of course, can be called a sweet valentine to all the Spider franchises, but it lacks the main thing - the processing of enthusiasm, the movie magic that made the Raimi trilogy and Webb's dulogy so memorable. For a film that seems to absorb the best of each part, it is shot outrageously simply: no tricky editing from the 00s, no spectacular flights from the Garfield series - a highly concentrated Marvel, where action scenes are from outsourced graphic masters. No Way Home's best visuals are the ones with Doctor Strange's figures, and all of these episodes, reminiscent of a teaser for the upcoming ""Multiverse of Madness"", are far more captivating than the Spider-Man battles against the Sinister Six. In this sense, ""No Way Home"" is likely to repeat the fate of another popular hit - ""Avengers: Endgame."" The conclusion of the superhero team saga became one of the highest-grossing films in history, broke records in forum discussions, but after a few months and a couple of new parts of the Marvel universe, it felt like it had sunk into oblivion, remaining an important, but still episode of a giant series . The third ""Spider-Man"" is also an intermediate movie, linking, say, the new ""Doctor Strange"", the continuation of ""Venom"" and other important branches of the franchise.

","I was very disappointed with this movie. Having enjoyed the previous two mcu spiderman movie I did not expect it to be. This movie picks up immediately after the previous one and depends so much on not only watching several mcu movies but also the FIVE pre-mcu spiderman movies it becomes almost unbearable. The story was ok for a crossover multiverse story of this kind but the script and acting are so weak and awkward it feels more like watching a random episode of a show in its tenth season. Like the actors are not into it and are just going with the flow. The whole movie depends entirely on big surprise moments to keep it going but almost every single surprise was known before hand thanks to trailers and internet buzz. I imagine even if you didn't pay any attention to any of that and tried to see it a second time it wouldn't hold up because without the surprises the movie has little to offer. And the few moments that weren't known beforehand online are entirely predictable, and feel very superficial when they're supposed to be dramatic and character changing.

3835,19 February 2022,lowpolygon,5," Enjoyable but pointless
","The main thing to note about Spider Man - No Way Home is that it's highly dependent on how you view the past films. For others who have a greater nostalgia towards them then they would have a more enjoyable reception. For me though I don't really have any strong nostalgia towards both the Tobey Maguire and the Andrew Garfield. Because of this the fan service felt more annoying than and reminded to some extent of Star Wars the Rise of Skywalker. This mainly in how characters seem to quote themselves which for me has always taken me out of the moment. It also felt really unambitious. With the exception of Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus returning characters don't really add much. The returning Spider Men don't really add much apart from verbalize messages Tom Hollands Spider Man is yet to learn. Tonally maguires universe, garfields universe and hollands universe don't really work together. Maguires universe feels very cartoony but not in a bad way. It doesn't try to think about reality which is evident with the fact the maguire can shoot webbing without a gadget and that harry osborn can hear the green goblin. Garfields universe tries to go more realistic, or at least what the creators think is realistic. This can be seen with the webbing done through a gadget but andrew garfields spiderman is notoriously annoying and narcissistic which evidently clear is how the creators think teenagers are like. This aspect of his characterization though is not carried through to no way home. Hollands universe whilst feeling comparatively more realistic than Maguires, is more meta and likes to poke fun at is self. One aspect I didn't like is that what makes bad guys bad is a physical thing that can be taken away. With green goblin from what I remember of the sam raimi films is that Norman is a flawed individual and it is not just the chemical. It also didn't handle the moral question of letting the villains die well as it portrays (Holland's) Spider Man learning that killing isn't the answer but no further though on the fact that the villains will die when they go back to there own dimensions.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

Magistral acting by Tom Holland, delivering a range of emotions with precision through the trama. Willem Dafoe plays the Green Goblin sensationally too, best villain shot in the movie, and one of the best villain impressions ever. Tobey Maguire showed why we love him again and Andrew Garfield had a great performance as well, a shame to see that they get such a little screen time. The main problem was their introduction in the movie, it will be way cooler if they appear in a crucial point, attracted by some fight. The fact that Spider-Man gathered all the villains just to release them is a little questionable as well, they could have done the same plot using another method. The Sandman personality change also were something a little rough. In a overall view, the movie delivered what the trailers promised: a lot of action with our beloved characters.

","Spider-Man is my favorite Marvel superhero. I just wanted to start by saying that. I love his suit, his powers, his spunk. Pros: Tom Holland was better in this film than the first two, but I still don't love him in the role. This movie was better than the first two in this series, but not great. Some of the characters are great to see again. Some of the teenage/young adult elements are fun and true to life. The end credit scene is pretty cool
Cons: Too many villains, the reveals don't feel deserved, and it really just is a 6/10 film. Better than some superhero films, worse than others. Zendaya is ok, doesn't feel like MJ. Aunt May is not really Aunt May in this either. Having Doctor Strange in the film made it more interesting, but it also took away from Spider-Man himself.

","This movie is very fabalous. It has a lot a fans serviece for all spider-man fans. The story is very incredible to follow what happend with Peter Parker and MJ after Mysterio told everybody that Peter Parker is Spiderman. After this all chaos story that he faced. So He asks Dr. Strange to cast a spell to make everyone forget he is Spider-Man. But things go horribly wrong, and the multiverse suddenly gets very real indeed. After I told a storyline, I think we can predict what will happend in this movies. But in trailer,we will see Doctor Octopus is appear. This is a huge fan-serviece for old school spider fans receive. And In movie, You will see a biggest fan-servieces for all spider-man fans that you might not thinking before. And then We will see how Peter Parker growing up after everything ends and show us he is not kid anymore and show his responibilities to stand by himself. Not be Tony Strak's boy anymore. And I think you should watch this movie. I very recomended you should watch because the storyline and one of the part that make this movie so fabalous is special effect. The special fx is make this movie more realistic. People can feel and imagine with the movie easily. Not even storyline and special effect but also music theme for this movie is masterpiece. Because in every scene than have music, we can feel what situation is and enjoy with movie very much. It was very enjoyable to watch in the cinema. I think didn't felt like a 2.20 hours movie because it is superbly entertaining. Directing was terrific due to superb pacing - every minute of this movie wasn't boring or anything. I'm very sure you will enjoy with this movie very much. Hope you will enjoy my review and happy to watch the trilogy of Spider-Man Tom Holland ver. :)",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

","If you enjoyed Spider-Man: Far from Home, then you will greatly enjoy the sequel to follow up the events, Spider-Man: No way Home. The movie stars Spider-Man struggling to conceal his identity and accidentally unleashing other villains from other universes that are out to kill him. After Peter attempts to convince Doctor Strange, to do a spell that has it where everyone forgets who is identity is except his loved ones but doing causes the multiverse to be disrupted. Through the movie, Peter learns that he cannot have everything the way it is as a hero and learns that you must be willing to sacrifice you relationships to ensure the safety of those that you dearly care about.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

","This movie has many elements that beg to be change/tweaked. It really keeps the movie from perfection and being the best of the MCU. Pacing is the smallest issue with this movie, the first act being the slowest, and the second dragging, making the movie seem longer than it is. Next problem I have is the way that Tobey and Andrew were introduced. Ugh! Why just why?! This could had been soooo spectacular and no it just wasn't it simple relied on your love of the characters to carry the scene and while it worked it wasn't impactful. Lastly is this director and his horribly bland shots, while there are some great shots in the movie, the dialogue scenes suffer the most from this boring style. What worked, worked. The acting was all there, especially from William Defoe as green goblin, and Andrew Garfields Spider-Man. Overall this movie was fun and while it easily could've been the best Spider-Man movie it doesn't come close.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

","What a masterful piece of filmmaking! No Way Home shines brightly in the world of the MCU, and manages to add enough genuine sorrowful ethos to balance out the triumphant joys. This movie is a true journey to things of the heart, and dares to ask (and answer) the question of why must good triumphing over evil leave such detritus in its wake? I have taken off two stars because 1:) the movie was just a scene or two too long and 2) the role played by the immensely talented J. K. Simmons should have been dropped from the movie altogether. But don't let any of this keep you home, the movie is a rollicking runaway train with terrific acting all around, with specific kudos to Marisa Tomei and Tom Holland. You can almost feel Holland's acting chops growing by the minute, and Tomei made the role of May hers forever. I left the theatre with the distressing question of what's next and how could they top this, hardly believing that they can possibly go any further, but I had the same question with nearly every movie in the Avengers Infinity saga only to be completely gobsmacked each and every time.

opportunity for what supposed to be the greatest Spider-Man(s) collaboration ever. It feels draggy, cringey at times, lots of unfunny lines, & by the 3rd arc I just look at my phone waiting for it to be done. Doesn't feel the hype whatsoever for the final fight. The problem with Holland's Spider-Man is that through the whole 3 movies he acted like a 3rd grade kid. The only time we can see him mature a bit is by the end of this movie. Something is wrong with MCU these days that I enjoy their TV series more than their movies.

","In short, this movie was a blast from start to finish. The character of Spider-Man himself has been and will always be my childhood and this film was honestly a beautiful trip down memory lane for me. I grew up watching Tobey's Spidey and it was brilliant to have him back. Obviously Andrew and Tom put in spectacular performances too. The plot does sound silly to think of it as it's just a bunch of mistakes clumped together, but I didn't mind it one bit. After all, Spider-Man is all about saving everyone and using his powers for the greater good. I must say as well that quite enjoyed the dynamic between Dr Strange and Peter. Their relationship was certainly tested in the film but it was lovely to see them form some sort of mentor-mentee bond a little especially considering Tony Stark is now gone. The villains I can honestly say were fantastic and wonderfully portrayed. Special plaudits certainly go out to Willem Dafoe's Goblin...just world-class with the delivery of his lines. Aside from that, just the element of nostalgia at seeing all these characters was enough to blow me away. So...for all the Spidey lovers out there like myself, this was a lovely tribute. A tribute that I would have never imagined seeing in my entire lifetime as a Spider-Man fan. Even for those of you with little to no knowledge of Spidey, just know that the movie is a work of art and if you don't believe me just go see it for yourself.

","Starts ok but basically this movie is like a child that really wants your attention but since it can't get it on merit it settles for making faces, screaming and crying. Stuff happens - that's pretty much it. Attempts at emotional moments are never deserved and feel like grade schooler saw a couple of movies and wanted to replicate some moments from them not understanding the idea. No amount of strings and piano will help with that if there is no proper build-up on all fronts unless you cater strictly to overemotional teenagers that can cry over seeing other person doing it (or trying to sell it anyway). But at this point it's like shooting fish in a barrel. Not much makes sense here, most jokes fall flat and even then they have to be explained. Overall creators don't give their audience too much credit and that's a little sad. Even for a movie that's mainly for kids. There are many better ones in this category. The whole thing is like jiggling keys in front of the baby's face for two hours with no substance. Given all the above I still would like to end on a semi-positive note, that is I guess the 12-year-old me would have probably liked it 'cose back In the day I liked 'TMNT 3' and '3 ninjas'. So if you don't mind watching a whole lot of nothing or can skip some parts or do something else during the movie like going on your phone (I couldn't, had to sit through it) you may even enjoy some parts of it. Probably also helps if you haven't watched any other movies before. If that's a case give it a go. If not, probably watch or do something else.

","So where should i begin. For me the appearence of the other two Spidermen in this movie was totally expected, because this movie is a total handshake of Sony and Marvel Studios. And it would have been a complete owner of Marvel to not include them. But i did not expect so much screentime and that they would have such big roles. This movie contains 2 or 3 pictures that i will never forget and these pictures are on a Denis Villeneuve Level which is completely amazing. The scene were Peter Parker (Tom Holland) stands in the rain right in front of the screen where Jonah J. Jameson is baiting against Spidey. Lets talk about Willem Dafoe. Dear God he is soooo great as Green Goblin. I hope he will play Joker in the new Batman movies. This Green Goblin is more crazy and more brutal than the one in Spiderman. I know its the same but without this movie Green Goblin would just be a Power Ranger looking comic figure. The Green Goblin in Spiderman just scratches the surface of potential they got out of this character. He is more creepy and dangerous and dramatic (Norman Osborne in particular). Doc Ock is again not the evil guy but a man who just wants to male the world a little bit greater. And the bromance between the Spidermen is just beautiful. They have to learn to team up which is great. And then the scene were Toby tells Andrew he is Amazing. Pr the hug of all three Spidermen. Beautiful. I cant even stop. Theres so much to talk about. The Ending. But the thing that really annoyed me is Nate. He can do magic in a second. Steven Strange needed much much longer to learn this.

","The movie has a lot of philosophical points. I'll explain some of them that were really obvious because if I get into everything the review will have the size of an essay. I'm not going to throw spoilers here. Anyways, Altruism is a misunderstood word because as people we do what we do to sometimes seem good no matter what if we are or not. Our world never needed a sacrifice or an idol but people who are willing to help our world for the best without caring about their reputation and their legacy. The fight between good and evil is classical but very important because the thought and the physical world doesn't exist without duality and the ending explains the whole purpose. So the prime of the movie meaning, between all the others, was how heroic and selfless/ anti - egotistical is to help people, save lives while remaining anonymous.

In fact, this whole scenario trick that Marvel pulled off was created for just one thing - retcon. This is initially an overly drawn line with Stark and a bunch of free technologies from him. Peter's poverty is not a special one, a small number of everyday problems, a huge arch with Avengers for such a long-playing character at the beginning of the journey, and so on.

Tom Holland shines yet again with some great acting in emotional scenes as well. Surprisingly dark and emotional scenes in the movie made it a great surprise. Gripes I have with the movie: It got a little too fan servicey with some dialogue sequences, stale directing (no interesting, new, or creative shots), weird editing choices, drastic shifts in tones (jokes during/after an emotional/dramatic scene).

The chemistry between Tom, Andrew and Tobey is on point and really feels ""real"" in a sense. For me personally, Andrew really steals the show which really feels like they gave him a redemption after being let down by the writers in his own movies. Having old villains return for one final showdown is just golden. Willem DaFoe puts on an incredible performance alongside Alfred Molina. Personally Jamie Foxx was my favourite out of the bunch, he really stood out among his fellow cast. Can't wait for Tom's next trilogy and what it might hold.

Even without the references, the movie brings alot of great acting to the table with the biggest showstopper being Willem Dafoe reprising his role as the Green Goblin. Yes all the original villains and hero's came back and gave great performances for the most part, but Dafoe comes out on top. Another amazing aspect to this movie were all the action sequences.

","Spiderman No Way Home was a good movie, but I think it was too underhyped then it could have been. If Marvel wouldn't have showed the other villans, it would have been way more exciting to watch it in the cinema. Also I think it wasn't that good, because the fights were short and the movie would have been better, if it would have been longer and have more fights and the spidermans find out about each others. Movie is overrated and there are way better Marvel movies, wich have been rated lower. Also I think Marvel should stop with the MCU or make a new Universe, because it's getting boring with the bunch of new movies and stupid with the whole Multi-verse. Great movies with great crossovers, but as I said overrated .",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

It would have been better if we had been introduced to the Toby and Andrew form Tom Holland's point of view above the school or while fighting the villians and ned trying call back doctor strange... but still good to have them back...
Its a good movie but my main problem is It was completely exposed by the trailers...
We all knew there were 3 spiderman ... we all knew about Doctor Strange's spell and electro fighting for arc reactor... hell we even thought aunt may could die... the only surprise was spiderman become adult and living alone...
it felt like injustice to the web shooters... like in Amazing spiderman lizard was webbbed even more but got out in 10 seconds... here he took 5mins with little to no webbing 🤷‍♂️

","The first part of the movie is in terms logic, the story was basically that peter wanted that his friends can go to college though he's Spider Man. He goes to Doctor Strange in order to everyone forgets he's Peter Parker. The spell goes wrong and villains of diffrent universes get into tom hollands universe. Now he has to catch them but doctor strange doesnt care whether they are caught or not. That's the part where it gets unlogical. He catches the villains so easy (in the previous movies they needed one movie for one villain) in this movie he catches every of them in 15 minutes. Then he fights with doctor strange about helping them he beats doctor strange in his OWN (self created) world. And now he sets all the villains free. And trys to help them with his new big scientific knowledge (as a teenager) it all wents wrong and May dies in a very woesome scene. The introduction of the 3 spider men was also so bad because of neds new wizzard thing he searches peter parker after he found two new spider men he didnt even asked wheather there is another new spieder men or opens again this wizzard thing to come to the real spider man. They have the hole time the thing to bring the villains back but they dont use it in order to make Mays death not useless. Now they're going to a SCHOOL CHEMISTRY ROOM to create a serum for each of the villains. The fights at the statue of Liberty were really impressive and flashbacking. At the total end doctor strange comes back and make all human on earth forget who peter parker is. MJ and Ned are going to college but forgot who peter was and on the grave on Aunt May he meets Happy again who also forgot who peter was. At the end I can say it was a good movie but totally not that good how it's rated on IMDb (at the moment i think 8.8) i would give the movie a good 7.2.

But in my opinion, this film tried to keep its predecessors as they were, and it felt genuine. There was real emotion in this film, the pains and hurts of previous Spiderman iterations were not polished away. No, they were there and they were redeemed in a way that I found moving and believable. And there are true consequences of actions in this film.

","Not a single character developed any sort of depth throughout the film and there was no clear plot line. This resulted in scenes meant to be emotional to not be very affecting at all. The film lays weight on giving the audience a nostalgic and sentimental experience which it does slightly but it harms the film because there's too many characters. The characters are pressed in which causes them to be very shallow and unnecessary when there could be a clear antagonist instead. Andrew Garfield and Toby Maguire's entrances are quite non cool when they had the potential to have a super epic entrance in some other way like a fight scene for example. The whole story is rather silly and makes very little sense, it's all caused by doctor strange's spell when in reality he should've stopped and came up with a better spell like making everyone forget what mysterio said.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

It moves at a ferocious pace and easily switches between drama, comedy and emotion, sometimes even in the same scene.

","Have never given a movie a ""10"" before and almost never write a review. But fantastic film on so many levels. The writers of this script were operating on genius level, given the ways they created a script that had a story line all its own that continued the prior Tom Holland Spider-Man movies AND brought together so many elements of the Maguire and Garfield we've already seen AND then weaving in elements of the MCU so seamlessly I didn't realize it happened until I was reflecting on the movie afterward. Very good acting across the board, but Tom Holland and Zendaya knocked it out of the park in the moments that mattered most. Tom Holland made me say ""Wow"" more than once, and Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield brought WAY more to their roles than I anticipated...WAY more. This had me engaged at a level that is pretty rare, and I am not ashamed to say I had tears in my eyes probably half a dozen times, including a very key moment with Garfield's Spider-Man, when he has an opportunity to, in a way, redeem a very specific, tragic moment from his own history.

There's a ton going on in this movie, and and most of it is highly anticipated fan service. Unfortunately, I didn't feel like they connected the dots in a meaningful way. It really felt like what it is-a corporate teamup between two major studios trying to use nostalgia for their previous releases. Character motivations felt flat and hard to identify with, and a lot of their dialogue often felt pretty out of character. Which is a shame considering the incredible potential this film had. I went in expecting this, so I wasn't disappointed, just frustrated when characters did things they wouldn't normally do, clearly for the sake of the plot.

","Spider-Man: No Way Home is one of the better movies I've ever seen. Usually I'm not to fond on marvel/superhero movies but no way home was an incredibly enjoyable film to watch. What sets this movie apart from so many other superhero movies is because of its ability to relate to audiences. Peter Parker deals with real life struggles and pain that reaches beyond the screen and allows you to feel these emotions with him. His friends and the fact he's still young and in high school dealing with incredibly large issues is an incredibly well set up plot that allows for a more relatable experience. Another key strong suit of no way home is the classic teen comedy aspect it includes for small portions that allows you to take a breath from non-stop action and chaos (Not typically found in standard hero story's). But what's most impressive is that Spider-Man: No Way Home created a non-confusing multiverse an incredibly hard thing to do in movies and story's. Overall the movie was funny, entertaining and well a bit depressing. One of the best movies I've ever seen and I'd highly recommend it.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

The action was also very entertaining and fun there was only one action scene I didn't like and thats the scene when sandman and electro fight in the woods it looks really bad and rubbery. It kind remind me of the original Spider-man's action and that looked so bad! Also The Story all over the place, Now this can work Spider-Verse is my favorite spider-man movie and the story is confusing except the movie i supposed to feel like insanity because we see all the villains early in no way home the villains are introduced in the 1 hour mark. And the villains weren't that much of a threat Dr Octopus is poorly developed, The Lizard doesn't have any importance to the story, Sandman was ok, Electro was funny but the villain who steals the show is oddly the Green Goblin yeah the guy I used to laugh at in the original Spider-Man. He probably read my notes because he is terrifying in this movie I heard a baby cry during the fight with peter. Oh and about that action scene it my favorite in the movie I think the goblins demeanor is terrifying while he messed up! The scene when aunt may died was a huge risk for the MCU that Im glad they took and It was heartbreaking.

Very well balanced screen time between all of the characters, with respect to which of them are the fan favorites. Malino and Dafoe rightfully get the most out of the villains. The respect and tributes given to the old movies is heartwarming and also well balanced. Of course, if you watched (and didn't completely hate) Maguire and Garfield's movies, you'll enjoy the many little references a lot more but the movie will work for fans of just the MCU just fine. It still feels very much like a MCU movie and Holland is still the main character. Just as it should be. Now why 10? Well, I wouldn't rate a comedy on the drama and narrative, I'd rate it on its jokes and whether it made me laugh. Likewise, I wouldn't say that The Shawshank Redemption sucks because it didn't make me laugh. Well, at this point Marvel have made their own genre in the MCU films. So I'm rating it as that. On the comic book nerdiness, World class CGI action and the corny humour. Not without a few minor plot holes but nothing bad enough to bring it down to 9. It delivers everything you want in a MCU film and is easily in the top 3 of best MCU movies ever, along side Thor: Ragnarok, and so deserves the 10..",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

The ending deeply saddened me as well as the death of aunt may (RIP 😞)The only thing i disliked about the movie is some characters made bad unrealistic decisions which made them look stupid but i guess these decisions must be made in order to have the action so it cancels out. The post credit scenes were interesting but i'm a bit annoyed that one of them was basically a trailer for a future movie which ruined the experience but the first scene was a bit odd at first, but when i understood that the symbiote was in tom hollands universe i was shocked as this could be the start of another movie.

They really can go beyond what they did in all of Marvel movie. But to talk about the movie facts, this movies itself is not that great (why you give 8! Cause I really love Spider-Man). The feeling from watching this movies is different, you can feel so much of what the fans will like but if you are not fan or just take your first time watching this movie you might be regret because the storyline, action scene, and script (except Willem Dafoe acting) in this movie is not exceed to what can you expect from a precious movie.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

It was the best spiderman movie and introducing daredevil in this way was amazing. But i wanted the theme song of tobey and Andrew also to feel the goosebumps but its okay. The fight between Dr strange and peter was also great. The ending was best it shows how the real spiderman is living in rented house alone, making his own costume and no one knows his identity.

4853,17 December 2021,rihannafenty-67603,10," One of the most epic movie in cinema history
","I went to the movie without getting any spoilers, I just watched the trailers, I saw a few theories, and I watched the actors's interviews. Before watching, I went with normal expectations, I knew it would be a good movie, but there were a few things that I couldn't make sure of were bothering me. I'm not a movie expert, I know so little about movies so you may disagree with what I wrote, these are my feelings within first hour. So about the movie, in my opinion, this movie is one of the best Marvel movies ever made. One. Of. The. Best. Marvel. Movies. I literally don't think there is a single word to describe my feelings rn. The last time I've watched End-Game, my feelings were this intense, but End Game is not even close what I felt in this movie. The story is basically based on Spider-Man's character which I found very clever, I mean the way how the story's reflecting his personality. I really don't quite know how to phrase my feelings and thoughts right now, while watching the movie, you're looking at a scene where you can feel every emotion, especially at a certain point in the movie, pain, happiness, surprise, confusion. The first half was a bit slower than the second half, but not in a bad way because it's a preparation phase, but the second half completely closes the stagnation in the first half because it ends when you don't realize what is going on because of action. There are typical Marvel jokes from time to time, I can't say I laughed at some of them, but it doesn't matter because I don't know if it's because I'm a Marvel fan in general or because I'm really feeling so hyped right now, but it really was one of the best, most surreal and most phenomenal movies I've ever seen. No matter with what expectations you go to the cinema, but definitely go. It was an incredible experience for me and it seems impossible to express my feelings without giving spoilers at this point :D As for after-credits, the first after credit was not a big deal, but the second after credit is really important, actually it was the only spoiler I've got, I guess but even though I got spoilers about this one, I remember holding tight to the theater seats. It was really awesome, it was a movie I wish I could forget and watch again, and I think it will be on my mind for a very, very long time.

Also SPOILER: Me and the rest of my theatre was just amazed and out of words for the inevitible return of Andrew Garfield AND Tobey Maguire! And Somehow this wasn't the only thing that carried the movie. They redeemed Tom Holland's Spider-Man with the amazing cherography and story-dialouges. Loved the villian's chemistry with each other and Peter. And I was worried that they coudn't make Willem DaFoe's Green Goblin (who was drop-dead AMAZING) the classic arch-nemesis of Tom Holland's Spider-Man due to the fact that GG is from another universe. I am thrilled to announce that I have been wrong! Everyone did an amazing job in this amazing piece of a movie.

Unfortunately, most other aspects of this movie fell very flat for me, the comedy was bad and which is rare for Marvel, Tom and Zendaya have less than impressive on-screen chemistry, there are random storylines only made for plot convenience and many other problems with the story, pacing, and general quality of the film. These aspects are drowned out by the shiny appeal of nostalgia, its unfortunate that this is prioritized over a general well rounded movie. Perhaps there is something to be said about the all to popular trend in Hollywood that prefers easy remakes and sequels over new and original stories.

","This is a movie made purely to satisfy the fans and there should be no doubt about that. No Way Home, in my opinion, is even better than Homecoming and Far From Home, and pretty much one of the best MCU movies of all time. It's a simple story, but the execution is fantastic. Even the smallest of surprises have a huge impact, and I could feel that in the theatre as I joined several other Spider-Man fans cheer out for both heroes and villains. The action sequences were brilliant; seeing them in 3D is totally worth the price of admission. Every actor delivered a believable, realistic performance, and especially our lead actor Tom Holland. The visual effects too were top notch and the editing was stupendous. Two and a half hours flew by real quick while watching this popcorn action entertainer. It won't be fair to reveal anything, so here I conclude my review, and recommend you to check out this new world of Spidey-ness on the big screen and in 3D.

I found the fighting scenes to seem easy and boring for the Spider-man(s). It was predictable, and I wish they would have brought in a new villain or a Spiderman we haven't seen in any movie yet. That would have taken it to the next level, and based on the reviews I was expecting something more. I didn't feel the ""how are they going to win this, there's no way"" that is usually felt in other Marvel movies, like Avengers. I wish that in the final fighting scene where Dr. Strange was doing his wizard things and opening the portal of the universe or whatever we would have seen some new villains and heroes, or even different versions of the villains we saw.

We laughed, cried and cheered for the guy all through the film. And in the end they tied it all together in what I believe is the best way possible. Peter Parker looses so Spider-Man can win.

","Spider-Man: Now Way Home was a great and very enjoyable movie that serves it's fans very well, when it was at its best. Unfortunately, when the movie is not at its best, it's wasted potential and boring. Going into the movie I was excited and expecting a grand fight, emotional punches, but most of all, it would deliver the same charm that Into The Spider-Verse did. The last fight felt underwhelming, belonging in the second act. There was a lot of emotional punches, but the movie would have done itslef a favor by keeping the whole ""forget Peter Parker"" thing out of the movie. This leads me to say, the ending was disappointing, as I feel it would've ended better with the multiverse just exploding, having the last fight be grand and epic, and going immediately into the next Doctor Strange movie. It did, however, bring the Spider-Verse charm as all three Spider-Men we're the highlight of the entire film. Overall, it was a fun movie and enjoyable experience and a movie I will definitely watch again, but watching it dissapointed.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

It's very different from what we've seen, and feels like not a lot is going on, the story is again, just what it is, and maybe because we knew so much about the film is why I feel that way.

","This is definitely the best Tom Holland Spider-Man movie, however there are some things that keep it from being amazing. One of the main things that I don't like is the the main Spider-Man crew, by this I mean Peter (Tom Holland), Ned, and MJ. I find each one of them have their own annoying problems, Peter is kind of dumb, MJ is rude and unlikeable, and Ned is just irritating. However these can be overlooked because the movie is still good. Having all of the previous Spidermen was an incredible idea and is easily the best thing about this movie as well as having returning villains. All the returning characters' performances were fantastic and I really enjoyed it. I do feel like if Toby and Andrew showed up earlier and had more fight scenes then it'd be better.

Extensive, Exquisite, Nostalgic, with a Emotional Ride, this movie had everything.

Tom Holland is fantastic in the film, and his maturation throughout the franchise has been a joy to witness.

","Spider-Man No way home is simply put a masterpiece. Encapsulating audiences in a world where anything can happen and everything does happen. From Matt Murdock appearing as Peter's lawyer and obviously all the villains from the prior Spider-Man franchises coming into this movie, it elevates the overall film enormously and creates nostalgia and empathy for characters that have been introduced years before. The first half an hour of the film set us up for a thrilling and action packed ride that doesn't have a bland or boring moment. Once Peter loses Aunt May to the green Goblin the tone of the movie dramatically dies down and becomes a more sinister and dark take on Spider-Man. This is in great contrast with the main attraction of Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire reprising their roles as Spider-Man. The amount of nostalgia is uncanny in this movie and sets a pace of emotion but takes its time to lay a story and plot simultaneously with the action and VFX. The inclusion of the final fight sequence involving the three Spider-Man and the original villains was a cinematic masterpiece in terms of action, emotion, cinematography and acting with a great sense of humour and comedic timing. The small but noticeable nods to the Sam Ramii and Amazing Spider-Man movies are sincere and provide jest to the viewers and loyal fans.

The story seemed slow-paced at times, and Peter Parker who's having all the senses as Spider-Man trusting a villain seems too lame and kills the interest in the storyline, and the Spider-Man from a different universe (Tobey) getting stabbed by Goblin while trying to save him?

","One aspect of the genius of Stan Lee, who invented not only Spider-Man, but also many of his most famous rivals, was the ability to create humane and sympathetic villains. Almost every enemy of Spider-Man was originally a good person, but then succumbed to emotions, became a victim of his own pride or a tragic combination of circumstances. That is why many of these characters can easily be transformed into antiheroes. The movie ""Spider-Man: There is No Way Home"" is dedicated specifically to the theme of redemption of villains who received a second chance thanks to Strange's witchcraft. Characters previously harmed at the hands of Spider-Man can now be saved by Peter Parker. Those who have watched movies with Tobey Maguire remember that Norman Osborn is mentally ill and needs help, and Otto Octavius has problems controlling his cybernetic tentacles - these poor fellows need to be treated, not killed!

And again I couldn't find it enough in this movie,Scenerio was simple and you could've guess what is going to happen after 10 minutes,charachters are not reliable(and for someone like me who didn't like homecoming/ffh) I couldn't even shad a single tear to their ""emotional scenes"". So about those ""jokes"" from high school...I don't even want to talk about it,It's fricking childish. Of course, I'm not expecting to DeadPool-like adult jokes but I really want to ask you is this really funny? I mean,reaaally??About villains I'm glad that they bring us the Well-created villains from their universes. Or,should I be? For example what Lizard adds to this story? Or my biggest hardbroke old ""spider-men"".... They just put those guys together so older spidermen fans will go to the Movie,just like me. But If you ask me is it worth,i would definitely say no. Except Green Goblin. Anyways if it wasn't the end of the ""Homecoming Trilogy"" I would've give 7. It finally taught what life is like to Tom Holland's spider-man. But if we agree the all movies are not binded for MCU Spider-man had a succes of solo it's 7/10 from my point of view. I wish they hired Marc Webb or Sam Raimi-like director and a good composer for the this serie. They'd treat it better.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

","Spider-Man: No Way Home is a 2021 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man, co-produced by Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. It is the sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019), and the 27th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).

They made his character be the biggest cry baby, a whiny little child who literally messes everything up and his faults, no matter how much damage he causes, literally become his missions. And what I mean by that is he's just too soft. It always looks like he's about to cry, after I don't know how many movies now that he's been in his voice still hasn't gotten deeper so he hasn't grown up at all he's still just a child even in real life. And I know he's supposed to be in high school and his movies which they lucked out and he basically stayed young long enough in all his movies to play the part, but I am so annoyed by these movies that I literally had to shut this movie off 20 minutes into it because like I said he was great in The Avengers Infinity War and Endgame, and in Captain America Civil War, but his own movies are literally for an audience of 7-8 year olds.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

5287,10 January 2022,Fingall,7," Stranger than strange
","I have a problem understanding how the other critics can give this movie such a high grade. Almost 200K thinks this is a 10/10. Previous Spider-Man movies from this franchise has a score of 7,4 so this is a huge step up in grading this movie. Therefore this is seen as the perfect Spider-Man movie without any flaws. Is that really true? Not at all. I enjoyed the movie, don't get me wrong, but this is far from a perfect movie, nevertheless the perfect Spider-Man movie. It is a fan feast deluxe regarding one-liners and characters coming back. The story is interesting but a little bit over the top without any staggering excitement for longer than a few minutes. The story lays more on the emotions for Spider-Man as a person and I think that is both good and bad. Good, because the emotional ride gives the character better dept and understanding and I think that is done brilliantly. Bad, because you loose both tempo and excitement regarding the action and the story gets a little bit more ""messy"" when it comes to putting it all together. Another thing is the antagonist in form of many old bad guys coming back. I think it is a cool part but it is not enough for me when it comes to having a good antagonist because the guys coming back is 5/10 bad guys and not that interesting or terrifying. The storyline has to focus on first catching them and then heeling them and that is not that exciting as when fighting Thanos or other interesting bad guys. I think that the movie could need a better bad guy or someone that has better power and is a ""real"" threat rather than a dog on the ""loose"". If you have harder obstacles to overcome when it comes to defeating it the tempo and stakes gets higher and more interesting. In this case the multiverse collapse or persons coming from other dimensions can offcourse be devastating but it is too complicated when you have it in the mix with everything else so that part feels secondary. Therefore that thing is more something that is in the background. Or so it seems. Because dr strange has the solution ready and there is never a struggle for me as an audience to se how they will fix it and when they can't the solve it right away. It also feels that they are trying to make this movie so grandios and big that they forget that it was the smaller arena that many loved with the previous ones. Or maby that was just me. There are many characters coming back and that is really nice though sometimes you lose focus because of everyone's ""needed"" screen time. I am struggling in giving it 7/10 or 8/10.

5372,27 December 2021,raulfontes,9," Spider Man No Way Home is the best Spider-Man movie of all time.
",Spider-Man No Way Home has been one of the most hyped up movies off all time. Lets start up with the best thing this movie gave us and that is giving us all three Spider Men on the big screen. Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield brought back their original Spider-Man characters next to Tom Holland's Spider-Man. This brought back a lot of nostalgia for many Marvel and Spider-Man fans around the world. We also got to see the original villains from the past two Spider-Man franchises. Jamie Foxx really played the Electro character great and don't get me started with Willem Dafoe's performance as the Green Goblin. Some negatives of the movie are that the plot doesn't really make much sense with supposedly everyone who knew Peter Parker was introduced into the universe but one of the main villains Electro didn't know who Peter Parker was. Either way this movie is great and a great way to celebrate almost 20 years of Spider-Man being introduced on the big screen.,/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

",Takes one of the most hated story lines in comic history and turns it in to a film masterpiece. Changing things just enough to make a compelling story that redeems story lines for characters that we never expected to get redeemed in ways we couldn't have imagined. It also brings to light that the past two spider man (Tom Holland) movies are of a trilogy that shows Spider-Man coming into his own. All three of these movies are his origin story. Finally the third movie shows Spider-Man becoming Spider-Man. With great power comes great responsibility. Spider-Man stories are the best when he is at his lowest. NWH's ending shows Spider-Man at an all time low leading to many storylines threads in many different directions but some how making the trilogy complete. The stories from now on will not be about Spider-Man finding who he is and we may see him be a mentor to new characters and maybe a co-leader in the avengers or young avengers! Things will be interesting! This movie was amazing and Sony has the ability to make a lot more movies and stories that can cross over with any movie or tv show they want. I hope they use this responsibly and not make this crutch. Use this ability to create impactful stories not bringing characters back to life just for the sake of it.,/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

","Wow, just wow. This film was wonderful and from what we learned from the trailers, significantly different than what I thought. It was a classic Spidey story but with an awesome twist. The fan service put in with the 2 extra Spider-Men was great! There was a *perfect* amount of screen time for all of them in my opinion. There was also quite a bit of love put into the villains. They all retained their desires. Some just want power and to be recognized, others just wanted to get home to their families. I'm glad that all of this was tied into this film and wrapped up. Even the supporting characters such as MJ and Ned got nice little character arcs or changes that were very welcome! The overall story was very compelling with Peter and his classic Spider-Man moral dilemmas and the other, older and wiser spideys helping him overcome his selfish human desires to help the people that he loves. Just overall a very nice way to end all of the Spider-Man movies and to tie them into one epic story. I give it an 8.9/10.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

","There is never a dull moment in Spider-Man: No Way Home. At a lengthy two hour and twenty-eight minute runtime, every scene still feels effective to the plot and moves the story along in a rapid fashion. This film truly is the culmination of Spider-Man films-from the Raimi era to the present series. Director Jon Watts hits all the right beats in capturing the character and feel of all these films. You will cheer as you experience nostalgic Spider-man tropes and elements from your childhood, you will laugh at the confusion of multiversal characters interacting (""The Avengers? Is that a band?""), you will even cry for some of the heaviest and most well shot scenes in Spider-Man film history. I truly believe this is a perfect Spider-Man film and the best Marvel film to date. SPOILER ALERT: I do not know if I will ever experience a similar feeling in the theater as the feeling I had when Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield returned. The union of three generations of Spider-Men on the big screen is a spectacle and surreal moment for all Spider-Man fans! Yet, their appearances were not needed to make this film a great film. Maguire's and Garfield's roles simply elevated this film to a special, once in a lifetime experience that we never expected to have.

","No way home starts you on the edge of your seat exactly where far from home left off so rewatch if it's been a while. But MAKE sure you watch the older Sam Raimi Spidey movies from the 2000's and the Amazing Spider-Man reboot by Marc Webb to fully grasp the arcs of some of the new villains. There's heartbreak, decent action and Easter eggs galore throughout the movie and until the end credits. The only flaw was not enough screen time between Zendeya and Tom especially since their real life relationship was confirmed this summer.

THEN BECAUSE OF NED TOBEY AND ANDREW CAME THROUGH PORTALS AND THEN THEY MEET TOM'S SPIDERMAN .

","This is definitely one of IF not the worst comic book movies I've ever seen. The movie contains a plot that can easily be avoided with basic common sense. The effects at times were awful, the movie quickly wraps up it's first plot in favor of the ""Multi verse"" plot. This movie needed to rely on fan service half way through. Peter & Strange were completely ruined in this movie. This movie ruined the villains from franchises that came before it. An example would be electro, believe or not he was decent is The Amazing Spider-man 2. In NWH he's not acting like himself. Sandman was completely butchered in this movie. Sandman had a reason for what he was doing. In this movie he goes evil for no reason, it's not even explained it just happened. The acting is mediocre, almost everyone gave a weak performance. The one shining star in this whole film is Tom Holland himself, that guy was the only one pouring his heart out into this movie.

From the best actions sequences to heartbreaking and emotional scenes, this cinematic masterpiece provides the best portrayal of the comic book character we have ever seen in history. Some argue the first act was not much, it isn't true as it brought up the story and developed it well leading up to the 2nd act. Its fan service is positively at its best, with a great and dark storyline. And most importantly hats off to Tom Holland for the absolutely amazing acting, he captured the essence of the character well and easily deserves to be rewarded. This is arguably one of the most beautiful
and creative pieces of artwork marvel has ever come up with. Definitely the best Spiderman film of all time. It really is a tear-jerker. This film exceeded my expectations as an enjoyable film I can watch thousand times and never get bored of it. Thank you to Jon watts and the hardworking team behind it and of course marvel studios. Credits and cheers to one of the best portrayals of a villain I've ever seen in Willem Dafoe's Green goblin and the other brilliant actors including Jamie Foxx who showed his class. This also brought out one of the best performances I've ever seen from the talented Zendaya who nailed the role of MJ and the talented Jacob batalon showcasing ned Leeds at his best. The cinematography in this film is remarkable and the beautiful shots of the scenery and the camera work were golden.

","This movie is ridiculous and annoying from start to finish. I love the spider-man chracter althoygh think looking back that Toby Maguires trilogy is head and shoulders above anything that followed it. I liked that version because it built on character and had a progressive plot an toby is also a good actor, better than the other two that followed. Maybe we aer so desperate to be entertained by a good movie during covid that everyone is just happy to have another marvel movie out but all i saw was dumb after dumb move. I cant stand it when a movie makes super dumb decisions in order to generate a plot an also does stupid things in order to attempt humour. The visuals are of course fantastic but guess what...the best characters and by far those from the original spider-man trilogy. The majority of this movie i sent cringing from the attempts at romance and from the the floods of tears which clearly had no impact on me at least and i found it heard to believe anyone else either. All of this entire plot was of course created in the most absurd manner and from a spidey who somehow became the biggest idiot at just the right moment for just long enough. Dr Strange makes an appearane - no spoiler there - and even he managed to stupify the situation rather in order to ensure the movie plot opened up. Can't directors find another way not to make characters do utterly stupid things in order to make the movie unfold?

","This was such a beautiful movie. The best thing I've experienced this year and I haven't been to a movie theater since IT 2 came out in 2019 I believe. The actors really did their thing especially Tom Holland this is the best role I've seen him as Spider-Man. It felt like no one outshined him in this film and for the most part the film made sense and didn't feel forced , rushed , or cringey. It was absolutely perfect and this film brought a nostalgic feeling bringing me back to childhood which had me feeling so good inside. The crowd was amazing felt like before Covid times. At my movie theater I went to the they had motion seats where your seats move during action scenes which had me enjoying it even more. Also half of my tickets were free because someone's friend never showed up so he left the free tickets at the consession stand. My favorite scenes were SPOILERS when Tom Holland's spider sense was tingling and he knew Goblin was about to attack , the fight scene between Tom Spider-Man and doctor strange, seeing goblin and all the other villains, Jaime fox joke about there being a black spider man out there , the fight scene at the end, when the Spider-Men from my favorite Toby McGuire universe and the other Spider-Man universe came together, when the second Spider-Man saved Mj, I just loved it all really love how Spider-Man had to make sacrifices in this film and how he matured into a grown man in this film. I loved the action scenes and i felt Aunt Mays death was realistic and i felt sad for her and really felt the emotion from Tom in this scene. I really feel Stan Lee would've been proud please go see the movie it was so worth going to the theater and watching it's a special film.

The action is seriously brilliant. At one point, there is a fight on the Statue of Liberty. The action is really intense, and you feel that someone will die. Humour is perfectly crafted in with J. Jonah Jameson, who blames everything on Spider-Man, just likethe Sam Raimi trilogy and the comics. The human scenes are excellent too because someone important dies, I won't spoil who. The moment of reflection is so emotional. The ending is too, and if you compare this film to Venom, which is the also made by the same company (Sony/Marvel), it is like watching a romcom after watching horror film.

","Aside from focusing on Peter Parker and the high school years more than its predecessors, the only thing that really makes him distinctive is that he isn't a standalone superhero, by which I mean he literally doesn't stand alone. He's Spider-Man in a world of wizards and fellow super people. He's the Spider-Man that's been to space and fought purple aliens armed with magic gloves. And without those team-ups and billionaire mentors, star cameos, and flashy tech, the MCU's Spidey, thus far, just hasn't been compelling enough to lead his own franchise. It's why the Spider-Man movies are easily the most underwhelming of the MCU's solo hero stories. And in No Way Home, once again, we need characters from other universes to show up for things to get exciting. It's also why the best Tom Holland Spider-Man movies have been ones in which he pops in supporting role, for instance, his electric introduction in Captain America: Civil War and his key contribution as the beating heart of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

The film balances the comedy with a dark/sad plot to follow. Tom Hollands spider-man in a film so crowded still manages to shine and outdoes himself with his performance. This feels like a true spider-man movie especially in the very last scene. His performance is incredible and some of the action sequences are beautiful with moves taken from the game. This feels like the most badass, realistic and cool portrayal of a spider-man yet. It maintains comic accuracy and tom's suits are beautiful. Some scenes are absolutely heart wrenching, i found myself crying numerous times. This film is a masterpiece and a love letter to all marvel or spiderman fans and a work of art. It avoids the other spider-man movies mistakes and just gives characters such realistic convincing arcs. A true work of art, round of applause for John Watts and Tom Holland.

5726,16 December 2021,nowkamarcel,10," Spider-Man: No Way Home. A film that is second to none
","With this title, Jon Watts created a great and spectacular film. It is full of allusions and Easter eggs to the other Marvel Cinematic Universe films and the previous Spider-Man films. High performance of music, images, sound and acting makes the third part of the Tom Holland series one of the best and most impressive films from Marvel. The numerous ""new"" heroes and villains do not let the story overload and even with no prior knowledge from the last Spider-Mans, you can keep track of things. The feelings are not neglected either. On the contrary, they are always shown differently in the course of the scenes, which, not least because of the actors' incredible acting skills, seems real and casts a spell over the audience. So the film is sad, you have to have your handkerchiefs ready once or twice in between, but at the same time, you have to add lots of funny and joking sections. Just Marvel. All in all, you can say about ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" that superhero films have been raised to a whole new level and that a starting point has been laid for future parts. Now, this level has to be maintained or even increased for the next Spider-Man. And you have to do that first.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

Do not read it. This movie has many advantages. The part that makes me surprise But sometimes the surprise It should not come out in a way that it shouldn't be cause. Spoilers : The scene where Spider-Man asks Doctor Strange for help. It should be a scene where Peter It shouldn't interfere with Doctor Strange concentration It should leave the doctor doubts , Peter shouldn't to tell the doctor that that person can't erase the memory,
This person should not delete ,This person too , Instead of finishing this discussion before the doctor casts the spell. This is what I see as it doesn't make sense. It's a good idea to use old villain in this movie that's surprise
But looking back, this surprise Does it cause any trouble? And who made this trouble happen? Of course! Peter make this surprise! I don't understand why he so stubborn cause the final result is It ended the first way Doctor Strange
have said it before, what peter did it's not for people not for himself but for tiring the energy of superhero should to use for the criminal on world not another universe, It was caused by Peter's innocence to make people hurt and died",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

Looked more realistic in Spider-man 2 nearly 20 years ago), and oh God, the cars that are smashed in the bridge fight are so awfully rendered that the PS4 Spider-man game looks way better. Yeah, it had many great characters, yeah it had many great heroes and villains from the other movies, but still... I left the movie so disappointed!!! It really felt that Marvel and Sony wanted to copy everything that worked in all the other Spider-man movies and Avengers and throw everything in a single 2:30 movie, the result is that no single character is developed in this movie! Yes, I watched every other single movie but I really couldn't care less about any character this time, because each character screen time was completely insignificant. Not to mention the scene in which Ned brings the two spidey's to help, oh God, what a mediocre and absolutely ridiculous scene!!!

",". This was such a beautiful movie. The best thing I've experienced this year and I haven't been to a movie theater since IT 2 came out in 2019 I believe. The actors really did their thing especially Tom Holland this is the best role I've seen him as Spider-Man. It felt like no one outshined him in this film and for the most part the film made sense and didn't feel forced , rushed , or cringey. It was absolutely perfect and this film brought a nostalgic feeling bringing me back to childhood which had me feeling so good inside. The crowd was amazing felt like before Covid times. At my movie theater I went to the they had motion seats where your seats move during action scenes which had me enjoying it even more. Also half of my tickets were free because someone's friend never showed up so he left the free tickets at the consession stand. My favorite scenes were SPOILERS when Tom Holland's spider sense was tingling and he knew Goblin was about to attack , the fight scene between Tom Spider-Man and doctor strange, seeing goblin and all the other villains, Jaime fox joke about there being a black spider man out there , the fight scene at the end, when the Spider-Men from my favorite Toby McGuire universe and the other Spider-Man universe came together, when the second Spider-Man saved Mj, I just loved it all really love how Spider-Man had to make sacrifices in this film and how he matured into a grown man in this film. I loved the action scenes and i felt Aunt Mays death was realistic and i felt sad for her and really felt the emotion from Tom in this scene. I really feel Stan Lee would've been proud please go see the movie it was so worth going to the theater and watching it's a special film. I'm excited for the next Marvel multiverse phases and possible next Spider-Man film after seeing Eddie Brock /venom in the credits scene.

Peter and MJ swing away from everyone and heads to Peters house where Aunt May and Happy are breaking up and everyone outside yell at Peter and everything. TV turns on where after a short bit Aunt May and Happy see that Peters secret is revealed on the news. Fast forward Peter is in custody being questioned by the police and a bit after Daredevil makes a quick cameo acting as Peters lawyer and catches a brick that is thrown through the window. This is the first 30 minutes of the movie that sets up for what's about to happen. Than Peter and Aunt May move to Happys place to get away from the angry Mysterio fans. So after a bit Peter Ned and MJ apply for M. I. T and they all get rejected for the reasons surrounding Peter. This is where the plot happens. Peter goes to Dr Strange to erase what Mysterio did but instead Strange suggests to wipe out the memory of everyone forgetting that Peter is Spider-Man and basically he isn't relevant to anyone but Peter tampers with the spell 5 times which during that time some villains escape their universe and come to the MCU world. So after Strange kicks Peter out of the Sanctum Santorum and Peter tries to find the head of M. I. T by calling Flash who got into M. I. T and bribes Peter for him swinging him to school for 2 weeks. So Peter chases her down on her way to the airport and we see our first villain. Doc Ock who battles Peter. Epic fight scene, he realizes that this isn't the Spider-Man he remembers. Peter hacks Doc Ock's tentacles and saves the MIT lady who gives Peter Ned and MJ a second chance of entering the school. Next we get a glimpse of Green Goblin, but just a second or 2 of seeing him before we are transferred into Doctor Stanges holding cell as I'll call it.

","I expected more from this movie. In the beginning I found it boring since the action took a while to pick up. It was like a puzzle with several pieces, which is ok, but it had so much components to it. At times I enjoyed some of the humor, but I thought in some cases it was a bit too much. I hated the fact they added a section that was unnecessary to insinuate that only black people are poor etc. We all know that every human race have poor, rich, and middle class people. Why do they think it's ok to make fun of the black race and keep sending messages that is not helping with equality. To make it worse they think it will be less painful if it came from a black man. That part was completely unnecessary because the movie in its entirety had nothing to do with that. On the other hand, the one part I really like was the idea of including all spider man (all the Peter Park) of the times. I love the story of coming together to support the 3rd Peter during a difficult time so they can fix the problem. Overall I thought the movie was very long, inconsistent with spider man power, and I've seen better marvel movies.

","I grew up watching all the Spiderman movies and this one is a lot of fun. It gives a ton of closure to some of the past characters and we get to see a lot of familiar nostalgic faces. However, the first arc of the film is dull and emotionless with very low stakes. It felt like the narrative was forcefully put together to meet the film's agenda. Dr. Strange acts very out of character. A lot of the logic behind the multiverse and aspects of the film are messy and unclear. Third act felt rushed at the end with most of the villians going down extremely easy, making you again feel not tense with very low stakes. You kind of know the entire third act that the villains are going to get their ass kicked easily.

5949,19 January 2022,toporandreich,10," Review of the movie Spider-Man: No Way Home
","We all remember well from childhood how the story of this super hero began, according to which all the boys were fans. As I remember now, the Ren-TV channel fox kids and cartoons about spider man. Then I could not even think that all this would be embodied in the cinematic universe, at first just the universe of spider-man, and then it would smoothly move into the Marvel cinematic universe. But yes, it came true from a dream into reality, and each of us from those boys running around the yard, already in adulthood and conscious age, watches all this on the big screens of cinemas. It all started back in 2002, when the wonderful director Sam Raimi first transferred the well-known comic book superhero to the big screens of cinema, well, then we all remember very well how the story of Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker developed in the next two films, which In my opinion one is better than the other. The story of Spider-Man from Sam Raimi ended in 2007 with the film, Spider-Man: The Enemy in Reflection, and in my opinion it was super, to end just like that, because the world saw for the first time on movie screens such an antagonist as Venom, finally it was revealed who killed Uncle Ben, the returned goblin, but already in the guise of Peter Parker's best friend, it was all a masterpiece, but everything comes to an end, like the Spider-Man film series at the helm of which was Sam Raimi. 5 years have passed and the legendary superhero, whom the world has not seen for such a long time, returns to the cinema screens. But something changed, Sam Raimi was no longer at the helm, and Andrew Garfield, who was still unknown at that time, appeared in the lead role. A new era has come. NEW SPIDER-MAN, which introduces us to the new adventures of a friendly neighbor, it is a pity, of course, that this new spider-man had not enough films, only two. That would seem to be all, Spider-Man will never visit cinema screens again, ant-men began to appear, the screens and the attention of the audience were completely captured by films with the Avengers, etc., but who would have thought that the creators of the film The First Avenger would surprise us like that : Confrontation, where the good old Spider-Man will return to the screens and take his rightful niche in the MCU. The role of Peter is now entrusted to the young and talented Tom Holland, who, in my opinion, suits the role of Spider-Man very well, because you still have to agree that in the first comic book Peter Parker was a teenager, and Tom Holland is just that. So going to the cinema to see ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" meant a lot, because I was very afraid that the film would not work for me as a fan of the MCU and, in principle, a fan of Spider-Man separately, but this did not happen, because the film turned out so awesome that going to the movies was worth it. I have never been to a movie theater where people applauded, I remember, goosebumps, everything was so cool. After watching, of course, I listened to a lot of opinions and most, unfortunately, were not the best. I will say this, this film will be really cool for those who are fans of MARVEL films and TV shows and watched everything from cover to cover and are aware of all the cases and capture the whole meaning of what is happening. The one who just goes to the movies to see what is wow cool, this is the new spiderman, etc.d, no guys, the film is not for you, there will be a lot of dialogues that, in principle, will not hook you, well, for that you can look at the action scenes and the return of the good old spiders in the role of Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, but again, you won't explain how and why they got there. So it's better to wait for the movie in good quality when it is already released on the Internet and think whether you should watch it or not, because after watching it in the cinema you will say that you spent money for nothing and slept through half the session on dialogues. Very cool the film will go to the younger generation, who, in principle, do not care about the meaning, but if only they would let them watch a fantastic fairy tale about superheroes, so that the children will be satisfied.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

It's like going back to your childhood for two and a half hours, when you're six years old and you're watching Spider-Man on an old TV. This film exceeded all my expectations, it was able to combine everything for which I fell in love with Spider-Man. In the hall in which I watched the film, every now and then they sighed nostalgically when a character from childhood appeared on the screen. It was as if I had returned to that dock-like time, when the halls were completely packed and you, together with the hall, could feel all the emotions that people are experiencing at the moment. It was nice to see old friends, such as the same Willem Dafoe (he remained the same as I remembered him in childhood), and Alfred Molina, who seemed not to have aged since our last meeting with him.

I personally saw it at least 3 times in the theaters. I just loved how they brought back classic villains from the original Spider-Man movies. Then bring all three Spider-Men together was amazing. The CGI they used for Sandman and Lizard was just marvelous. It looked really good on the big screen, and it wasn't fuzzy at all. The fight scene at the end of the movie was one of the best superhero fight scenes i have ever seen. Overall this was just a great movie.",/review/rw7659410/?ref_=tt_urv,SpiderMan_No_Way_Home_2021

The fact that Peter didnt try to explain to MJ like he promised just did not feel right. He lost both his best friend and his girlfriend, not only that but he lost them AFTER he promised to get them back. Why? I dont know, probably because they got into MIT and were happy bla bla bla.
