","The Incredible Hulk, based on another marvel superhero and also the 1970s TV show, revolves around Bruce Banner becoming a fugitive after his science experiment exposes gamma radiation on him which transforms him into the Hulk which becomes his appearance for brief periods of time. Meanwhile, General Ross and his army including Emil Blonsky tracks down Bruce and little does he know that Emil decides to use a serum that would give him some abilities while also transforming him into an even worse creature imaginable.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

","As I am writing this review, Avengers: Endgame is breaking box-office records as the culmination of 11 years of the MCU. Marvel Studios has become a juggernaut that seemingly nothing can ever stop. When The Incredible Hulk came out in 2008, the second movie of the so-called « Phase 1 » after Iron Man, such a success was merely a hope, if it was envisaged at all.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

","In 2003, Ang Lee's Hulk was released to commercial success  breaking box office records for a June opening and smashing its way to the top of the box office, it outperformed many analysts' expectations and was well on its way to becoming one of the biggest comic book films ever produced.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008
3,15 June 2008,Aaron1375,8," Smashingly good fun.
","This movie was the second film to release that would set up the 2012 Avengers film. In retrospect, it was a bit of a mistake as it did underwhelming business at the box office; especially when you compare the box office take of this film and the first film to release, Iron Man. Why is it a mistake, well there was already a Hulk movie released only five years prior to this one and it too was a disappointment. That being said, this is the better film than the 2003 Ang Lee film, I just feel it released too soon after it. I think if that film had not existed, this one would have performed considerably better. Not the 300 plus Iron Man did, but perhaps a 200 million dollar film rather than making about the same amount as Ang Lee's film did. I also believe they tried to do a bit too much with the story, not that it is complex, just that they almost blend the comics, with the television show and the 2003 film. At the end of the 2003 film, Bruce is in South America, at the beginning of this one he is in Brazil...so it's a sequel? No, not at all. The origin that is shown during the credits alludes to the television show, but Hulk looks like the comics. Just too much and trying to appease too many people all at the same time. I also think Norton was poorly cast in this one, as I did not get a Banner vibe from him at all. He just does not seem like he is into the role and considering he did not opt into doing the Avengers film and beyond suggests that he was not into it.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

6,12 June 2008,DICK STEEL,9," A Nutshell Review: The Incredible Hulk
","The crowded streets and cluttered housing on the streets of Rio De Janeiro provided some reminiscence of Jackie Chan's Police Story, where you could be sure of a chase scene zig- zagging the streets to take advantage of the wonderful opportunities presented for an exhilarating chase. And Leterrier doesn't try not to provide action junkies plenty of action- smashing moments as we root for Bruce Banner to hulk up, unfortunately of course, to satisfy our lust for some unadulterated action where everything in the way of the Hulk, gets smashed. However those expecting action from the get go will be disappointed, as there were only a small handful of action sequences, though of course they include the classic moments that comic fans had been baying for since 4 years ago. So I guess most will be left happy as we see some nifty moves by the Hulkster, which will leave a smile on your face, despite being used in limited doses. But I note though that the story cum action, looked a little bit like Superman II with the seeking of a cure and the deliberate loss of power to be with the lady love, and the duking out between super-beings on equal footing (here being gamma-powered), with a tinge of Cloverfield like moments too.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008
7,16 November 2008,brando647,8," An Incredible Reboot
","I was not one of those who hated Ang Lee's 2003 portrayal of the Hulk. I did enjoy it to an extent; it was a bit slow-moving and there were some parts that needed some improvement, but it was overall a decent film. I do agree that Louis Letterier's 2008 film was a vast improvement, though. It improved on all of the issues I had with Lee's film. The film is a reboot of the dying franchise: Bruce Banner has been hiding in Brazil, attempting to keep a low profile while he searches for a cure for his condition, but General Ross becomes aware of his location and enlists the aid of Emil Blonsky, a soldier with a mean streak. A bit of non-sanctioned experimentation later and Blonsky becomes a creature rivaling even the Hulk in power.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

","By the looks of the ending of Ang Lee's Hulk (2003) it seemed that there is going to be a sequel. After 5 years we now have The Incredible Hulk which is a reboot like Batman Begins. The reboot was a better idea than a sequel because Hulk (2003) wasn't a bad movie but wasn't even great either and was better off as a one film itself. But if the first attempt at a Hulk movie left you feeling a little green, good news! This version has a whole new cast, a whole new mood, and even a whole new retelling of The Hulk's origin",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

","Before getting into the film, I should probably point out that I am not the best reviewer for this film--unless, like me, you aren't all that familiar with the Hulk. Apart from seeing the pilot of the TV series and riding on the Hulk ride at Universal's theme park, The Island's of Adventure, I have never seen anything of the green guy--not a single comic book nor the previous movie from 2003. So, for the die-hard Hulkophile, I am certainly not the best person to review the film. In fact, I only have watched super hero films because I have a friend and daughter who push me to give them a try. And, in general, I have enjoyed them...but I am still not a big fan.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008
13,23 June 2008,Robert_duder,9," Completely obliterates Ang Lee's mistake and makes it right in a big way!!
","I am going to re-watch Ang Lee's Hulk generally considered disastrous by fans so I can review it properly but I seem to remember it being pretty awful and in no way an homage to the monstrous hero that fans love. Now I'm not a huge Marvel fan by any means but I love the hero movie and they needed to redeem Hulk and The Incredible Hulk redeemed him and then some. This was the true Hulk film that fans would have wanted and now we can firmly pretend HULK never existed. Relatively new director Louis Leterrier takes the helm and makes Ang Lee look like an amateur and clearly Leterrier must be a Hulk fan or at least turned to enormous Hulk fans because this had everything. The film paid huge homage to the original 70's/80's series which I think is just incredible. It used the music from the original series on one or two occasions, Edward Norton seemed to really channel and pay respect to Bill Bixby's Banner character and his transformation definitely leaned towards that. Terrific cameos from Stan Lee (as always), the original Hulk himself Lou Ferrigno in a terrific and funny cameo that felt like a hand over of the Hulk reigns (although it was only coffee), Robert Downey Jr., and mentions of Stark Industries (Iron Man), the Super Soldier program (Captain America) and other terrific Easter Eggs.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

","First off, let's get one thing straight - - - this movie is NOT a sequel to the 2003 Hulk which had attempts to portray many things from the Hulk comics (father-son conflict, father-daughter strained relationship, a love triangle of sorts) that resulted in a confusing, sometimes scary (remember that scene where The Hulk was fighting off killer dogs?) movie.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008
15,23 October 2008,Chrysanthepop,," The Hulk Is Back With A Smash
","'The Incredible Hulk' sort of takes of where Ang Lee's 'Hulk' ends. It's not an exact sequel as a few events are changed but arguably it serves well enough as a continuation. This one succeeds in parts where Ang Lee's film failed. Leterrier's direction works for an action film as it's got all the required ingredients. It's a lot slicker and full of action. The pacing is comparatively well set. The special effects are an improvement (but the CGI is still very prominent). The camera-work is solid and the score is wild. The story isn't as effective as say this year's 'Iron Man' because the characters aren't well fleshed out and the dialogues are a bit clichéd. Edward Norton fits the role of Bruce Banner quite well but we don't see much of him because of the CGI hulk. Eric Bana wasn't a bad choice for Ang Lee's Hulk either so I wouldn't compare the two actors. Actually, the Bruce Banner in Ang Lee's version was better fleshed out and gave Bana more scope to perform. Liv Tyler, however, is a little too weepy and she shouts a lot. Clearly Connelly was the better choice. Tim Roth and William Hurt are adequate. Overall, this is an enjoyable action flick even though it's no 'Iron Man'.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

17,13 June 2008,DarthVoorhees,6," Good if you like the Michael Bay breed of film
","The Incredible Hulk is a tough character to adapt and I really think any filmmaker would have trouble making a good film version of the green guy. When a comic book film is adapted to the big screen the movie goer wants a story to balance the action and in this movie we have no story. The entire film is a special effects extravaganza wrapped in between pieces of bad dialouge and characterization. Creating an effective Bruce Banner is key to making any Hulk adaptation work and it hasn't been done yet. The original Incredible Hulk series that is beloved by so many plays like a melodramatic continuation of Adam West's Batman series, and Ang Lee's Hulk, which I feel is still the best adaptation of the story, tried to add too much dramatic substance.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

I had never really been a fan of the Hulk comics, but I did like all the movie adaptations of the Marvel Comics. While I didn't enjoy The Incredible Hulk as much as Iron Man, it's still great fun, and it will definitely make a big profit at the box office, and hopefully more money than the first did.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

","From that brilliant poster of Ed Norton dressed all in denim walking away from the huge frame of his alter ego the Hulk to the superb end fight that shows the makers of Spiderman 3 how it should be done this is a great film. Not by any means a brilliant film but a truly enjoyable superhero romp none the less. Gone is the emotion that Ang Lee tried to inject into Hulk (2003) and back is the smashing and shouting and smashing. Plagued by his demons and his uncontrollable green counterpart, Norton plays Dr. Bruce Banner a scientist with a secret, desperate to find a cure. Hot on his heels are the army lead by Emil Blonsky (Roth) under the command of General Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross, who just so happens to be the dad of Banners girlfriend Betty (Tyler), who wants to know how he gets all angry and use the technology to create 'super soldiers'. Plus Iron Man Tony Stark is in it. That then is about it, what you get is a chase movie with some great characters, some great effects and a couple of amazing set pieces including the end fight between the Hulk and the Abomination. All in all it's smashing stuff that should leave other superhero films green with envy.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

","I had a great chance to see The Incredible Hulk yesterday and I wasn't expecting much, after the total flop that was The Hulk in 2003, I wasn't too sure that this was a good idea. Now, granted, Edward Norton is one of my favorite actors of all time, he is just terrific and has such a wide range of characters. Seeing him for the first time in a super hero movie was going to be interesting. But from the trailer, this looked once again like it was going to be over the top and not really entertaining. However The Incredible Hulk was actually... incredible! It was highly entertaining, the CGI was a thousand times more believable than the 2003 movie, the actors were great, and it pays great homages to the TV show and comic book for the fans. The Incredible Hulk does have small flaws, but the story keeps you interested and Edward Nortn couldn't have been a more perfect choice as The Hulk.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008
22,11 September 2011,drqshadow-reviews,2," Questionable Re-Reboot is a Hulk-Sized Leap Backwards
","There ought to be a law for relaunches of a franchise less than five years after the last attempt: every negative must be destroyed if it winds up being even worse. From start to finish, this was a total mess of a film that seemed more interested in finding room for not-so-subtle cameos and wink-nudge-grins than telling a functional story. Knocking out the Hulk's fabled origin story during the opening credits may have freed up the rest of the picture to explore new territory, but it also killed the basis of the cast's relationships and removed any reason for the audience to care about them. Ed Norton and Liv Tyler turn in genuinely rotten performances, with a black hole of chemistry as an on-screen duo, that are neither true to the original characters nor interesting in the slightest. Bruce Banner never comes off as remotely intelligent, let alone the super genius he'd have to be to come up with the formula that turned him into the Hulk, and actually spends more time running from grossly generic government operatives than using his brains. That effectively kills the intriguing contrast between he and the Hulk that should be fueling the story. Both characters are mindlessly running, just in opposite directions. Corny dialog, predictable twists and turns, weak CG, flat characterization and sleepwalking actors - this blew up in Marvel's face.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

Ang Lee's Hulk film from 2003 was a poor adaptation of one of my favorite comic book heroes. I have always loved the comics, but felt that the film didn't do the character justice, where as this new Hulk film, which is a reboot of the Hulk franchise, finally took advantage of the Hulk franchise and delivers an adaptation that is both truthful to the comics and entertaining at the same time.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

The majority of people disliking this movie and loves Mark Ruffalo's Avengers Hulk. In my opinion Edward Norton's Hulk/Bruce Banner is still to this day the best (not saying that Mark Ruffalo was bad because by all means he wasn't). This movie has class effects and it just as good as Iron Man. After watching Hulk (2003) I was really, really disappointed over that lame over long, boring to death super wannabe comic book film.

Anyway, when this was first announced, I had little faith that it would be any good: at first, I even doubted Edward Norton’s suitability for the lead but, seeing him in action as Dr. Bruce Banner, he brings the right elements of intelligence, paranoia, tenacity and anguish to the role (his relationship with Betty Ross – nicely played by the luscious Liv Tyler – is very moving, making for one of the more compelling couples in this type of film).",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

The excitement never lets up in this one. From the introduction of the ""hulk"" when the original experiment goes awry. Later on, other pieces come together, and we understand how each of the participants contributed to the tragic transformation of our hero. It is the trademark of a good screenwriter than he is able to create multidimensional characters, without relying too much on narration or extended dialog pieces. Most of the information is delivered visually, through montages, and a couple of lines placed at the right moment in key scenes to recall past events.

","What a summer Marvel is having! Iron Man hitting big was great but Incredible Hulk may even top it. I caught a pre-screening and I can assure everyone that the Hulk delivers more action and maybe more fun. If you are concerned that this film is another Ang Lee type misfire, don't be. It's about 100 times better then the version of five years ago. Unlike the Ang Lee effort, it's presented in a way that can be savored. The pacing is perfect and the action is relentlessly awesome. What's amazing is that they managed to play both sides perfectly. It's far deeper then I would've thought given the subject matter. Each frame is packed with action, emotion, drama or intensity. I was expecting to see a crazy green giant destroying the landscape and fighting another crazy green monster for two hours. I was shocked at the complexity of this movie. Given Edward Norton's involvement, I don't know why I'm so surprised. The action is certainly there but the tone is perfect, a mix of the TV flavor with all the action from the comic books. Hulk does indeed ""smash"" but it's more then just dumb action with no plot. It truly is an all around exceptional film. Also, I'm amazed at how far the CGI came since the first teaser trailer. This remarkable CGI works very well and it offers the chance to savor a complete movie going experience without being pulled out of the film. This trimmed downed Hulk looks perfect and his opponent is truly frightening. The final battle between the two will go down in movie history as one of the greatest fights of all-time.

Instead of coming off like the English bad ass special op he's supposed to be, he comes off more like a jerk with Napoleon Syndrome. Someone more physically imposing like Vinnie Jones (Bullet tooth from Snatch), or Daniel Craig (the new Bond) would have been more convincing for the part. But I'm just picking here.

I thought that movie had a magnificent sense of pathos. But here we go the great things with modern super hero movies is just like the comics we can re-imagine them as and when the film makers see fit, and in this case it has been done well. Marvel is on a bit or a role here as they have now surpassed my expectation with both this movie and 'Iron Man' This movie seems to cleverly run on from Lee's version whilst giving you an altered history in the opening credits. We have Bruce Banner now holed up in Brazil a fugitive trying to understand his so called disease. Whilst General Ross is desperately searching for him to cultivate his research into a weapon. Where this film differs from the first is that it is action pretty much all the way and very well done it is too. Hulk seems a little smaller and therefore more accessible but the CG is good and the rainy sequence trick is used once again to help the blending in of scenes. Also where this film will work for the fan boys is in the appearance of a proper comic book villain in Abomination. Abomination's back story is handled well and Tim Roth gives a good hammy performance to match the stellar efforts from the rest of the cast. (I have heard Edward Norton is unhappy with the cinema cut and would like to see the cut he preferred, and would really hope he makes himself available for any potential sequels). There was some good homage's to the past with a TC clip of Bill Bixby, a cameo by Ferringo and the inevitable Stan Lee cameo and a real plus for me they even worked in a little bit of the old TV theme tune.

There's also General Ross (William Hurt), Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) who later becomes The Abomination, Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson) who tries to cure Banner, and Betty Ross (Liv Tyler)-the general's daughter who stands by Bruce through all his trials and tribulations. Great mixture of drama, suspense, and action as provided by director Louis Leterrier. Eagle-eyed viewers who've lived for the last 40 years should have no trouble spotting previous portrayers of Banner/Hulk: Bill Bixby in a television scene from his earlier series ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father"", and Lou Ferrigno as a security guard who lets Norton in (He also says something as the Hulk in a later scene). And of course, Stan Lee puts in his Hitchcockian cameo! One more person I'd like to mention is Ty Burrell-late of the cancelled show ""Back to You""-playing a shrink who also gets involved with Betty.

The first film had no emotion and was mostly filled with long scenes of dialogue or useless scenes with the Hulk fighting other creatures. That film also made up stuff about Bruce Banner's dad being involved in turning Bruce into the Hulk, which was never a part of the old TV shows. This film is very emotional and puts a greater focus on Bruce, not what he turns into. Unlike the first film, the cast is actually made up of known people, including Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, and William Hurt. There are also little bits of humor that make this a more fun film to watch, such as Bruce's girlfriend giving him a pair of purple shorts to wear. The action scenes are good, but not great. This is a pretty gruesome film that can be a bit disturbing to some audiences like myself, though it is still far less than ""The Dark Knight."" It can be painful to watch when the two Hulks are fighting and when Bruce is injected with the chemicals. This is not an unwatchable film, but be aware that it can be tough to watch at times. Parents take caution; it is fairly violent (not bloody) and somewhat gruesome for young audiences.

78,19 January 2010,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,8," The Hulk returns to the big screen... and there is much rejoicing
","This takes a considerably different approach than Lee's poetic, cerebral attempt. It is grittier, dirtier and considerably more intense. Props to Marvel for getting the rights back, and now doing these movies themselves. And on that note, I commend the people involved in making this for clearly not only knowing, but of infinitely greater importance, *understanding*, the material. From what I've read, which is admittedly not the most remarkable amount to boast with, they hit the mark to a large extent with this. The plot is engaging, develops nicely throughout, and remains interesting. Every bit of the plentiful action is awesome, epic, exciting and entertaining. That final fight... wow, that is the best of its kind that I've seen in recent memory. The writing is well-done all the way. Dialog, save for a few lines here and there, is magnificent. The characters are well-written, with some quirkiness here and there, fortunately seldom taking over. The humor in general is rather balanced, and the several solid laughs that are to be had do not detract from the rest. This holds talented actors, and it shows. I have to say, when I heard about Tyler, I couldn't see her in the part, though after I heard Leterrier's thoughts on it in an interview I was hopeful, and now I do get how she works as Betty. Norton beautifully internalizes, and he's not off in his performance for a second. Hurt *becomes* Thunderbolt Ross(if, arguably, the role isn't all that fleshed out in this). There is genuine emotion in this. Notable range is even found in the CGI(which gets a serious upgrade), with facial expressions and real weight to the beings. The FX in general are excellent. This gives fans numerous things that they would want in it. The pacing is fast, at times, perhaps too much so(then again, it's not overwhelming, and the audience always gets to catch their breath when needed). I've heard(well, read) that 70 minutes was cut out... obviously, that shows, at least a little. For my money, this is, nonetheless, amazing. The tone is well-achieved, and this can be dark, without reaching a point where only grown-ups can watch... and it never seems tame, either. Nods to the original medium are found in this, and they're well-integrated. There is a brief suggestive bit, a little moderate language, mild violence and/or disturbing images in this. The trailers give a lot away; however, it's still an awful lot of fun, and it is not terribly predictable. The 2-Disc Special Edition DVD holds well-done featurettes(three of which I will review on their individual pages here on the site), with explaining of the effects and stunts, an alternate ending, 43 minutes of deleted scenes, a 6 minute animated comic, and an amusing and informative commentary track by the director and Tim Roth. All of the aforementioned is well worth watching. I recommend this to fans of those who put the film together and/or the comics. 8/10",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

Liv Tyler is class as Betty Ross and is always capable of delivering some emotion and feeling into her parts. Bruce's experiments toward a cure and the military's involvement because of the planned super soldier programme is all in line with the upcoming Captain America story.

","Here's the thing about comic book heroes. Most of them have silly names and often sillier costumes. But there's something so fundamental and human about the ones that have survived half a century. Spider-Man isn't just some dude swinging around New York. He's a young kid trying to balance so many competing parts of his life and spreading himself too thin. We all know what that's like. With the X-Men it's not just people with cool powers kicking the crap out of each other. It's about being part of a minority and others discriminating against you. Who hasn't had a taste of that? And with the Hulk, it's ultimately anger management. Literally having a monster inside of you and how difficult it is to control it. It's about being at war with yourself. So yes... his name is ridiculous. The idea of a giant green monster is a little out there. But when these movies have enough small character moments peppered in with the action there's a chance to really connect with them and allow yourself to forgive how unrealistic they dare to be because you're so immersed in their universe. The Incredible Hulk is not the best comic book movie ever made. It's not even in the top three.

","The Incredible Hulk (2008): Dir: Louis Leterrier / Cast: Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, William Hurt, Ty Burrell: Not a sequel to the 2003 film but a different take on the huge green monster scientist Bruce Banner transforms into once anger sets in. He is tracked down by military who wishes to subdue his power. Director Louis Leterrier does well with a decent screenplay that bares similarities to the Ang Lee version yet details additionally elements that work every bit as well. Edward Norton plays Banner who struggles to control his rage. He is sought after by the Army until a freak accident has him on the run. Years later he is discovered at a bottling plant after his blood accidentally enters a bottle. He must learn to control his rage and master this condition. Liv Tyler is no Jennifer Connelly and her demeanor throughout becomes increasingly annoying especially in her constant crying out of his name. Ty Burrell as her boyfriend is a pointless addition to the cast as well. Tim Roth plays a soldier who injects himself with the same substance used on Banner. He will mutate and engage in a thunderous battle against the Hulk. William Hurt as Ross's military father jeopardizes his relationship with his daughter while on pursuit of what he perceives as the villain. His drinking scene in the conclusion gives way to a great cameo. As good as the 2003 version sustaining its hulking effects. Score: 9 ½ / 10",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

","Research scientist Dr. Bruce Banner has the weight of the world on his shoulders; a genetics experiment gone haywire could potentially turn him into a monster if he loses his temper, thus making him the target of a relentless U.S. government. Living in isolation in South America, Banner seeks out a cure for his unstable condition, but in order to complete his research he must return to the States and seek out his long lost love (Tyler) with her bloodhound Army general of a father (Hurt) in tow. Reimagining of Ang Lee's 2003 Marvel Comics adaptation succeeds by avoiding needlessly convoluted story tangents, instead relying on a more straightforward approach with plenty of destructive action scenes, superior special effects, and characters who make sense. It wouldn't be as effective without the work of an excellent cast, with Norton perfectly vulnerable as Banner, Tyler warm and empathetic as Betty, Roth chilling and tenacious as Bronsky, Hurt callous and cold-blooded as General Ross.

","Well, after nearly five years, most thought there was to be no sequel to the 2003 ""Hulk"". But, shortly after the spectacular ""Iron Man"", ""The Incredible Hulk"" arrived. I was surprised to find out Louis Leterrier was behind this thrilling film, but I guess he was truly the right man for the job. Where do I begin? Well, to start I'll say the story by Zak Penn was dope. The pacing is better I must admit and most viewers will find it much easier to embrace and connect with the characters. Edward Norton is perfect as the ""mild-mannered"" Bruce Banner. Although some say he didn't portray the conflicted-side of Bruce enough, I think so. Liv Tyler and William Hurt also star, making this cast spectacular to say the least. The Hulk himself looks much more fearsome and the muscles are much more defined. In short he looks much more ""beasty"". But it comes at a cost of diminished realism really.

It somehow creates a sprawling adventure mess that takes us through a tired string of horribly cliché scenes from a Brazilian favela all the way to Broadway. As a result the only way this revamped HULK can sustain our interest is by staging bigger, louder and more CGI laden action scenes - by the time the Broadway showdown was in full swing I simply couldn't care less. As if the stock characters and stock dialogue weren't enough (we even get the stock zany NYC cab driver, a NYC establishing shot all by himself - where have I seen that before?!!), we have to further suffer through Liv Tyler's idea of acting - her mere presence on screen instantly makes a scene bland. In fact I wager that you could intercut a shot of Liv Tyler within every classic scene in the history of cinema and those scenes would be ruined beyond all recognition. Any attempts at humour or romance fall flat on their face, she has NO chemistry whatsoever with Ed Norton who in turn is in full paycheck mode.

However, there is something noble in Bruce Banner's (Norton) journey to control the great anger and power within himselfThe Hulk. In that regard-- Edward Norton is powerful.

","Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) has been living in a barrio in Brazil for the last year. This is because he is a wanted man, after a laboratory accident that went awry. As you may have heard, Banner was exposed to gamma radiation and when he is overly ""excited"", he turns into a nearly all-powerful monster called the Hulk. In his monstrous form, he killed several folks in the United States. But, unbelievably, that is not exactly why he is being pursued. A bonehead military man, Ross (William Hurt) is after Banner so that Bruce's blood can be used to generate another super-being, rendering the American army invincible. Ross' beautiful daughter, Elizabeth (Liv Tyler), a biology professor, was once involved with Banner and is still the object of the fugitive's affections. To help capture Banner, the elder Ross enlists the aid of a Russian-turned-Brit, Rambo-type (Tim Roth) who is very successful at snaring his prey. But, Banner still has a few tricks up his sleeve, as he seeks the aid of an online scientist who may have a cure for his condition. So, who will emerge victorious, Banner or his misguided seekers? This is a good film with unbelievably great special effects and a wonderfully touching performance by Norton. It is on these two strengths that the film succeeds, for the script is uneven and inferior, the direction is one-handed and the events a series of implausibilities. No, it is not the science that is lacking, it is the supposed intelligence of the military. Knowing what this man-monster can do, how could anyone possibly believe that humans could claim victory? Yet, Hurt's character is built on that misguided belief. As stated, Norton is a wonder, for he infuses his character with courage, smarts, and sensitivity. The rest of the cast is quite fine, too, as Tyler, Hurt, and Roth fulfill their roles nicely and the lesser actors do a good job as well. The opening chase scene in the barrio is exciting, even though the viewer feels Banner was deliberately placed in Brazil so that the scene could happen. All other scenery is quite wonderful, too, as the viewer is transported to Guatemala, Mexico, D.C. and even to British Columbia. Costumes are fetching but of small importance. Noteworthy, too, are the fabulous special effects, as Banner's transformation into the Hulk is most impressive and the havoc that ensues when he is in action is mind-boggling. However, the storyline is not worthy of such dazzlement, being, virtually, one long hunting excursion. Should one skip it? No, not at all, as it has enough good elements to make it worthwhile.

Firstly for those complaining that the Hulk looks fake from the commercials, don't worry, he looks a lot better on the the big screen and so does the Abomination which is the villain for this piece. This movie succeeds action wise with some really good stunts and lengthy battle sequences to the point where I was never bored in this movie. The only problems i had with this movie were very minor. Firstly, the dialogue was very weak. I like Louis Leterrier's directing style but Zak Penn's screenplay was really weak. I like how they tried to quote some of the famous lines from the TV series eg. 'hulk smash!' but when you are making a live action superhero movie it does not fit. Another thing was William Hurt who I was if no one else was hoping to love in this movie because i think he is a terrific actor. It was not that he was wrong for the role, he was perfect but his acting was almost lazy. It felt like he was acting on the basis of 'oh its a superhero movie, who cares I am probably going to get a big paycheck.' Aside from this everything worked really well. Ed Norton was perfect as Bruce Banner and even though i liked Eric Bana and thought he did a good job, Norton kicks his ass! Awaiting this movie I was prepared to really hat Liv Tyler but she turned out to be better than expected.

","Ang Lee's movie Hulk received an extremely mixed reception upon its release in 2003. While it did deliver as a drama, and the performances were pretty good, as a Hulk movie it kind of left out the Hulk, we barely saw the big green giant, and for a comic book that took pride in Hulk smashing it really didn't feature an awful lot of it. I suppose it's no surprise that Ang Lee's version has almost been ignored, it wasn't a commercial movie, and while I appreciated moments of it the movie just really wasn't a Hulk movie. So The Incredible Hulk is rebooting the entire series, while its not a complete start over like Batman Begins it just seems like a fresh new break. And what a fresh break it is, The Incredible Hulk basically smooths over every flaw the original movie had yet maintains the quality drama from the first movie. But most importantly of all, Hulk finally smashes! The final fight sequence is pretty much one of the highlights of this year so far, it is truly incredible. The performances are also an improvement, Edward Norton being a much more accurate interpretation of Bruce Banner, Liv Tyler being superb as Betty Ross and Tim Roth, well just being downright brilliant on lead villain duties. Sure the movie essentially is a big dumb popcorn flick, but its also an extremely well made one.

","First, I have seen only parts of Ang Lee's 2003 Hulk but never complete so if you want comparisons I can't give that to you. That said, let's focus on Louis Leterrier's The Incredible Hulk; even that this film is like a reboot it begins more like a sequel, actually when Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is already in his ""exile"" due to his ""green"" problem. During his stay in Brazil, he has an accident that will put him again on the map of the US Army (in part courtesy of Stan Lee). Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) is their ""special weapon"" and now we have just a search of Banner, who travels from Brazil to Guatemala to Mexico to finally the United States. There he meets again his love, Betty Ross (Liv Tyler), and the rounds between Hulk and the Army really begins. The visual part is great and delivers a terrific Hulk and a terrific fight at the University. Tim Roth's character seems to be in personal fight against Hulk but at this point of the film, he is the only one who really believes that. I mean, the guy claims ""well this is our second round"" or something like that but actually he hasn't even touch Hulk during their first meet in Brazil and in the University Hulk beats him easily (funny scene by the way). Of course when Abomination finally appears, courtesy of Banner's helper Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson), Hulk will have a true rival. Both deliver pure action in the climax of the film, and the entire film is just that: pure and fun action entertainment that, I guess, will be enjoyed by the true fans of the comic book.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

The story was very well explained. The movie started out write away with them explaining what went wrong and how Edward Norton became the hulk. This one was way better than the first Hulk they made. This movie probably had one of the best battles in any movie at the end when The good Hulk faced off against the bad. They made the Hulk look so good.

","In the 1960's, a genius named Stan Lee, created for a company named Marvel Comics, an entire stable of characters who were unique and exuded originality in many aspects, including their characterization, their abilities and the style of storytelling of their adventures. Each and every one of his creations was in some way the a brand new innovation. Spiderman, the Fantastic Four, the X-men, Iron Man, Daredevil, Thor and of course, the Hulk. Owing to the worldwide success of the first Spider-Man film in 2002, Marvel has since sought to recreate all of Stan Lee's characters for the big screen and reinvent and reinterpret them for modern audiences. Their most recent and ambitious attempt at this has been with the creation of their own studios, Marvel Studios which will produce several films featuring various Marvel characters, set in a common continuity, so that the characters may interact in a future crossover film. The Incredible Hulk is the second film to be released as part of this ambitious project and following on the heels of the highly successful Iron Man, it has certainly done pretty well commercially and even critically, though probably not as much as its producers would have liked. Though the Incredible Hulk is a reboot of the short-lived Hulk movie franchise (which began and ended with the 2003 Hulk film), it does not retread the plot of the previous film by retelling the characters tragic origin story...rather it has the unique quality of reinventing the character and reintroducing him to the audiences while at the same time taking the character forward and presenting new material to viewers who have seen the previous film. The story revolves around Bruce Banner, who has been living with the curse of the gamma-charged monster called the Hulk for five years now. Banner, who is on the run from the US Military, led by General Ross, seeks a cure from his abnormal condition, with the help of his ex-girlfriend and his arch-Nemesis's daughter, Betty Ross. General Ross however is determined to capture the Green Goliath and to this end empowers a Special Forces veteran named Blonsky with the Super Soldier serum.

155,23 June 2008,cultfilmfan,8," The Incredible Hulk
","The Incredible Hulk is a live action film version based upon the Marvel comic book's famous superhero who has become famous through both television and even a feature film from five years ago. I have seen small parts of the live action Hulk television series from the 70's, but only small parts and never an entire episode. Also growing up I did read some graphic novels, but I was never really into the many superhero comics that existed, so before going into this movie I only knew a little bit about the Hulk from what I have seen of the television shows and the trailers for the two films. I would guess that the more knowledge you have about the history of Bruce Banner and his alter ago the Hulk, the better off you are enjoying this movie. Unlike some of the other superhero films we have seen lately, this version does not really give us as much of a back story of the Hulk, or Bruce Banner. The film takes place after all this has happened and how Bruce became the Hulk, we learn in flashback scenes and just through conversations that the characters have with each other. Still, I did not find the film hard to follow because of this and it still made it easy enough to follow for someone like myself who was never really been into the comics, television shows, or other sources of media that the Hulk has been in. Reviewing a film like The Incredible Hulk, or even Iron Man, or some of the other action superhero movies lately, is not quite as fun, or always that easy to write about compared to an art film such as Mister Lonely, which was the last film I saw in theatres. I find it easier to write more about experimental, or artistic films, or even films with a lot of in depth characters or happenings going on. I personally like to analyze the films and characters in the movies that I 'am watching and I 'am not trying to sound biased, but usually in a film of this kind, you do not have a whole lot of character study, intelligent dialogue or thought provoking material that will stay with you long after the film is over. However, I can say that much like the other kind of films I have reviewed this summer (I'm talking more about the Hollywood releases that mostly have been about superheroes and have big budgets and so on) The Incredible Hulk is not anything groundbreaking or new and probably not even particularly needed since we just had a Hulk film a couple of years ago and we are getting bombarded with superhero films, but on the positive side this movie has an excellent pace and will have enough action and enough going on to please even the most particular film viewer. Like many of these type of films I see simply because my theatre doesn't usually get the artsy or intelligent films, I liked this film simply because of the entertainment factor and that is all I can really go by for my recommendation. And by recommending it, I'm given it a positive rating, but would much rather persuade people to see something like Mister Lonely if it is playing in your area, or even the vastly underrated film Sex And The City, which is a Hollywood film, but unlike the Hulk it is clever, has well developed characters and leaves you more to be satisfied with intellectually than two hours of mediocre special effects and action scenes that are really nothing new. If you are a big fan of Marvel comics and the Hulk then this film will be for you and for those who live in a city like mine where you are stuck with films like this, you could do worse than seeing this film because it is entertaining and even though it's strictly by the books it is entertainment and I guess that is what people want to see when they go to the theatre, so this may be right for you. As for me I liked it, but I don't think it will be something I'll see again, or remember even a couple of months from now when I have seen more and hopefully better films.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

","Despite the negative reviews of the first movie, I'm surprised that Hollywood gave the Hulk another chance; however, instead of picking up as a sequel, Hulk gets a reboot with a new back story retold in a flashback... or not. ""Incredible Hulk"" is meant to be a reboot, but it can be felt as a sequel. Banner's dream can be construed as revised imagery, and Ross's memories can be behind the scenes details of the first movie. There are no real contradictions that this movie is anything but a sequel; Betty is still a colleague, and Bruce is still in South America. The only problem I have is the cast. Edward Norton plays Banner much like Bana, and Liv Tyler and William Hurt replace Jennifer Connelly and Sam Elliot who I much preferred in the roles. Tim Roth, however, steals all his scenes as the power-hungry Emil Blonsky more obsessed with being like Banner than being a real soldier. That's kind of where it falls apart for me; you'd think Ross would hire more qualified men with less than shaky psyche evaluations. At some point, you'd think Blonsky would realize why Banner wants to get rid of this thing. One of the highlights is Tim Blake Nelson as the puckish and affable scientist who will become the future Leader. Unfortunately, Ty Burrell gets limited scenes as Doc Samson and is pretty much only an observer to the life Tyler's Betty Ross and her complicated relationship with her father. The plot and script, however, are excellent, the action is impressive and the brief jokes and ""Easter eggs"" along the way to the ""Avengers"" movie are enjoyable. What the movie lacks from the strong cast of the first movie, it actually makes up for a much tighter and lighter story, even going as far as embracing the scenery and imagery of the TV Hulk series. At times, Norton even looks like Bill Bixby. What I like even more is that the CGI is a bit better that we get slow tertiary shots of the Hulk before being blasted with him in entirety, eventually exploding toward a full-on animated climactic battle between the Hulk and Roth's Abomination (now a bit more reptilian and orange) on the streets and rooftops of Harlem. An earlier showdown between the Hulk and the Army deploying high-tech weapons is one of the top scenes in the movie. The only thing that would have made this movie even better than it already is would have been including Dean Cain as Superman to scrap with the Hulk, because, let's face it, the next top thing for comic book movies should be an inter-company crossover.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

Also, Liv Tyler's character decided to buy a rather expensive looking camera after she sold her diamond studded pendant which did not add to the plot at all.

","To comment on this movie I will do a comparison between the Eric Bana (EB) version and this the Edward Norton (EN) version. The first thing to say is that what the EN version has demonstrated is that with some screenplays/directors you can tell a story in 2 minutes what some screenplays/directors take half an hour to do. The EN version told us the audience in two minutes how Bruce Banner came to be the Hulk while the EB version took half an hour of valuable film time. Secondly the EN version stuck more or less to the TV series of the Hulk that featured the late Bill Bixby while the EB version went off on some weird tangent bringing in Bruce Banner's father into the equation. I was also particularly touched by the tribute to Bill Bixby that was in the EN version while also giving the great Lou Feringo (He is the TV version of The Incredible Hulk if you didn't know) a speaking part with him exchanging dialogue with his alter ego (David Banner) so to speak. To be fair the Hulk action scenes in the two versions were comparable but the idea of the super soldier in the EN version was easier for me to accept than the Father Son conflict as given to us in the EB version. I also liked the way the EN version once again paid tribute to the Bill Bixby TV series. This was done when Bruce Banner met Betty again. For those of you too young to have see the television series of the Incredible Hulk, the regular feature in that series was Bruce Banner thumbing a lift.

","The Incredible Hulk (2008, Louis Letterier)
I am going to start by saying I really love this movie. I have always liked the Hulk as a character and I think this film does justice to the character and also to the MCU, still in its infancy in 2008. This movie seems to be widely discredited and not very well regarded although I haven't heard much in the way of valid arguments to that effect. After the success of 'Iron Man' 'The Incredible Hulk is the second film from the MCU and is directed by Louis Letterier who does a very good job here. Edward Norton stars as Bruce Banner and Hulk in a motion capture role. Most notable here is that Norton is the most prominent role in the MCU to be recast as he famously fought with director Letterier over the final edit and chose not to promote the film. Norton was replaced in future MCU projects by Mark Ruffalo who would go on to be the more popular face of the Hulk in this universe. Along with Norton the film stars Liv Tyler, William Hurt and Tim Roth. The only actor to reappear in the MCU following work in 'The Incredible Hulk' was suprisingly Hurt's Gen. Ross. This film is a great introduction to the Hulk and Banner without being an origin story. It contains a good fugitive plotline that pays homage to both the comics as well as 70's television show. It has decent villains rooted in Hulk mythology as well as some pretty hectic action sequences. There is honestly very little here that I don't like. Other than introducing the Hulk there is only minimal expansion of the MCU story as a whole, but that is to be expected as this is still the first act and all these intial films' primary purpose are just character introduction rather than attempting to vault us immediately into the larger interconnected story that is bubbling under the surface.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

","This reboot to 2003's Hulk starring Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth and William Hurt did precisely what it was made to do: to be an all out, guns-blazing, hell-hath-no-fury fighting, bone crunching summer blockbuster. The main problem with the first Hulk is that it took itself too seriously, it had more talk and less action and I'm no Einstein but the best place for a 10 foot tall, green beast is in a street duking it out with a 10 foot tall brownish abomination with spikes shooting out in his back. The reboot just did that. It may have not been a 30 minute fight scene as promised but still, we are treated with such a visual spectacle you will be on the edge of your seats until the Hulk does his trademark move, the ""HULK SMASH!"".",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

","I attended a sneak preview of The Incredible Hulk last night. Incredible? No, but Very Good. And it washes the bad taste left in my mouth from Indiana Jones and the Big Letdown. The story is good, the acting is awesome. Ed Norton is the perfect person to play the tormented Bruce Banner. He is more believable in the roll than Eric Bana. Liv Tyler is very good as Betty Ross (formally played by the tasty Jennifer Connelly) William Hurt as General Ross is impressive and makes for a worthy adversary to Bruce Banner. If I had to come up with a negative, it would be Tim Roth. While I really like him, and he always plays great villains, I feel he's just miss cast here. He seems tiny next to General Ross. Instead of coming off like the English bad ass special op he's supposed to be, he comes off more like a jerk with Napoleon Syndrome. Someone more physically imposing like Vinnie Jones (Bullet tooth from Snatch), or Daniel Craig (the new Bond) would have been more convincing for the part. But I'm just picking here. The movie is a joy. Great action. No long boring, dragging development stuff that the first Hulk had in spades. There are some very nice cameos as well. Some were a surprise, some were not. I didn't see Nick Fury anywhere except in a brief headline in a montage. However I did not remain through the credits, so there might have been a scene at the end like Iron Man that I don't know about. I give it ***1/2 out of ****.

Overall however, the Ang Lee film suffered from being too ambitious and overly complicated, and simply not being what the audience expected.

209,30 May 2009,tburke85,8," The Incredilbe Hulk Does Justice To The Character
","The Incredible Hulk does justice to the popular comic book character giving audiences what they expect from one of these movies. Ang Lee's version of the Hulk wasn't that bad with some cool action sequences but it was long and a bit of a disappointment. This reboot gets it right and this is the one they should have done first. With a whole new cast and director The Hulk is back. It may not be as good as the Dark Knight or Iron Man but it's still an entertaining comic book brought to the big screen. Director Louis Leterrier does an excellent job at keeping the story moving at a steady pace with just the right amount of Hulk action throw in that fans of these type of films crave. This time around Edward Norton plays brilliant scientist Bruce Banner. Eric Bana played him in the film by Ang Lee who did a decent job with that role. But Norton inhabits the role of Banner and becomes that character. Norton's Banner is a cursed man desperately looking for a cure of the rage that lies within him waiting to be unleashed. With films like Primal Fear, Fight Club, and Pride and Glory, Edward Norton continues to establish as an extremely gifted actor. Liv Tyler steps into the role of Bruce's love Betty Ross taking over for Jennifer Connelly who did a good job with that role. Tyler's Betty is a beautiful smart scientist who loves Bruce and hates what her father has done to him. She proves to be another effective actress in the talented cast. Well done. The rest of the cast are admirable in their roles including Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky a soldier with a thirst for power who will go through a similar experiment like Bruce that transforms him into a nightmarish beast known as the Abomination. Roth makes for an effective villain but his role in the movie unfortunately is cut short because for the last twenty minutes or so he lets his CGI counterpart take over. Other then that Roth is great at playing a villain with a lust for power. William Hurt takes over for Sam Elliot (who was good in the other one) as General Thunderbolt Ross who just happens to be Betty's father and Bruce's rival. Hurt doesn't really have much to do in the movie but he does an admirable job with the role. Hurt's Ross is a man obsessed to create a super soldier who's willing to bend the rules in order to protect his country and get what he wants. Tim Blake Nelson has a small role as Samuel Sterns. He brings some comic relief to the film and does a great job with his brief appearance in the movie. The special effects are much better than the first one, the Hulk and the Abomination looked realistic, even though you know it's CGI. All the action is intense and well choreographed I especially enjoyed the first chase sequence because it felt very real and not something made up in a computer. The battle royale at the end was cool but it did feel a bit anti-climatic and didn't last very long either like the one in Iron Man. There's always a surprise cameo at the end by another popular comic book character who had his own movie that came out the same year this one did for those of you who haven't seen it. I won't tell you who it is but for those of you who have seen it you know which cameo I'm talking about. Despite its few flaws the Incredible Hulk is much better than expected and is an improvement over the first attempt to bring this popular character to the big screen. With plenty of action, chases, explosions, drama, and thrills, if this sounds like a movie you'd enjoy than go see the Incredible Hulk. It's sure to please anyone looking for an above average comic book to watch.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

It's exciting, entertaining, action-packed and suspenseful and keeps you right on the edge of your seat the entire time. Edward Norton did a fantastic job as ""Mr. Green"" and met everyone's expectations. The fact that he helped write the screenplay for the film says a lot about his talents and abilities as an actor as well. Liv Tyler delivered a good performance too and together they both added a great deal more to the film. Her character is compassionate and kind which I found to make Norton's character more human. And the little bit of romance they had on the side too wasn't a bad idea either. Every great comic book hero has to have his girl, that damsel in distress that requires rescuing from time to time. And I was surprised to find that some lines Norton delivered in the movie were actually quite humorous and that's always a plus. The last battle sequence between the Hulk and the ""Abomination"" was awesome. The ending leaves the story line wide open for a sequel with a special appearance from Tony Starks, the Iron Man. It was really neat to see how they tied the two Marvel characters together in what promises to be another great movie in the making. I am anxiously awaiting the next film.

","Marvel isn't one to let lackluster box-office and mixed reviews keep a good superhero franchise down. In the case of the the Hulk, one of their flagship characters, Ang Lee's 2003 film proved to not be the potent blockbuster they were after, so, five years later, Marvel has rebooted the character with The Incredible Hulk, featuring none of the cast or creative principals of the previous entry.

Although I am one of the few that thought Ang Lee's take was also well done, this version makes that one pale in comparison. With great acting by Ed Norton, who captures the bittersweet struggle that Bill Bixby bought to the character, and excellent acting by William Hurt as the cold calculating General Ross; this movie has few misses.

I'm not one who thinks it's great, either, but it was entertaining. I don't think The Incredible Hulk is any better, and I'd probably rank it a tad below Lee's film. This one is more action-oriented, although I honestly think the percentage of running time the action lasts is similar in both movies. The Incredible Hulk wraps its thin story around three giant action sequences, each better than the last. It's a lot of fun during those parts. Other parts, eh, not so much. It's fine, but it's the kind of movie where you keep thinking, ""Okay, blow something up already."" I still have the same major problem with this one that I did with the last one: CGI. Yeah, I'm beating a dead horse, if you're familiar with my point of view already. I especially don't think CGI works when the animated characters are supposed to be humanoid. When the Hulk is standing next to Liv Tyler, to me it's no more convincing an interaction than when Mary Poppins dances with cartoon penguins.

","I really enjoyed this movie. This is the version of the Incredible Hulk that I wish they had kept throughout the MCU. That's not a slight on Mark Ruffalo, his version of the Hulk is good and more ""fun"", but when you compare the two, CGI quality aside, this version of the Hulk is meaner, stronger and looks more like a monster. The story is pretty straight forward and basic and the pacing is a bit slow as they explore character relationships but the action sequences are well done and you really do get a sense of the Hulks strength. There's also a little bit of humour, but it's subtle like when Bruce explains to Betty that he needs to remain calm at all times and then the very next scene they are taking a New York cab across town and his heart starts beating uncontrollably as they weave in and out of traffic. It's kind of funny to think that Banner could turn into the Hulk because of a taxi ride when usually it's from being beaten up or seeing his friends hurt! I also wish the MCU would revisit some of the plots established in this film because there is clearly a scene setting up the emergence of one of Hulk's greatest foes, The Leader, but it's never been mentioned again in other films that I'm aware of... Edward Norton played the role of Bruce Banner well I thought but the standout in this film for me was William Hurt as General Thunderbolt Ross. He did a fantastic job and no wonder he stayed on to continue portraying the character in the MCU. My favourite scene was the end fight between Abomination and Hulk, the actual end of the fight itself was a little bit of a let down but the lead up to it and the back and forward feats of strength were fun to watch.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

It seems to be going pretty well until the military somehow found out where he has been hiding and hunted him down and it pretty much goes from there i guess. He makes his way back to the states, meets his old girlfriend, and so on. The scenes where he becomes the hulk are really worth it especially the final fight between him and abomination.

","The Incredible Hulk starts it's story moving immediately assuming we already know the story lines which is mostly true. This is a good idea as there's a quick prelude and setup to the story. I enjoyed the first 20 min of it pretty well - good pacing, good action, decent acting, and wonderful locale of Brazil capped off with a great chase scene. However Liv Tyler is a poor casting choice and it becomes a problem once she enters the story. Her acting is somewhat vanilla and the romance between her character and Edward Norton's is really flat. Detractingly awful actually. What's worse is there's a good 20 min of it at least during the movie - too much emphasis on a weak link. She needs some better direction and work with the scenes alongside the Hulk CGI too - she looks like she's staring off in different places instead of the Hulk's face. Additionally William Hurt is pretty forgettable as supposedly a brass general as there's too much subdued in his actions and conversations to make him believable as a leader. Edward Norton gives a rather standard performance - not as good as some of his past movies but satisfactory. This new Hulk is lavish with effects, some pretty exciting action sequences, and the Green man looks pretty good more like the comic-book looks like the aim of it. Probably the best performance is by Tim Roth as sort of an over-zealous soldier owing to good writing in this instance. Anyway The Incredible Hulk is not as good as Iron Man (spoiler - if you've seen Iron Man you'll love the cameo.) needing more humor, but definitely better than the earlier recent Hulk by Ang Lee who failed in the look. This is a good effort unfortunately with some standout flaws, but worth a watch certainly.

The Incredible Hulk (2008 version) is more mindless (not a bad thing), more entertaining, and fits the tone of a comic book movie better, BUT it also has its flaws. I say that its easier to just pop in this version and watch, BUT I cannot help but feel that I do have more respect for what the filmmakers tried to do in the 2003 version.

","You see, here's my problem, Ang Lee's Hulk was, to all intents and purposes, a noble film, very noble in fact. The man responsible for bringing one of the definitive Jane Austen adaptations to our screens as well as one of modern cinema's great martial arts epics, not to mention The Ice Storm, took it upon himself to art up, for lack of a better term, I do apologise, I'm sure I could have come up with something better, a property that consists of a man turning into a green monster who says 'Hulk smash' pretty much most of the time. It was noble, of course it was, layering in a foundation that took in split screen editing, that worked, and a complicated relationship with his father and a brooding atmosphere, it was just the film was turning the character and story into something it wasn't, which is why I think bringing in Louis Louterrier and essentially broadening the whole style of the film is a good move, and let's not beat around the bush, The Incredible Hulk, as opposed to Ang Lee's Hulk is a broader movie in every way. The film is not as inherently complex as the previous, the action is more frequent and a hell of lot more fun and more clear to see most of the time and the relationship between Betty and Bruce is a lot more romantic, with a lovely comedic element becoming a lot more engaging. In fact the whole film is engaging in every way that Lee's isn't. Edward Norton, an actor for fairly intense performances, brings that element, but also fun, to his performance and his uncredited work on the screenplay. He plays the more light hearted moments (stretchy pants, anyone, or inability to make love with Betty) beautifully, making his Banner quite a lovely character and you can't help but feel sympathetic to his plight. Liv Tyler is lovely throughout, but that's really all she brings to the table, but let's not get carried away, she does it well, whilst the villains, William Hurt and Tim Roth are fantastic, particularly Roth who literally becomes a worse character than the one he is chasing.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

","The first HULK movie was just the beginning. It was a bit on the dark side. The only enemies he had to face were the Hulk-dogs and the Army. ""The Incredible Hulk"" is an overall improvement from the first. There was a plot, there was an enemy, there was some action. The cast was great. Edward Norton as the brilliant Dr. Bruce Banner; Liv Tyler as Dr. Elizabeth ""Betty"" Ross; William Hurt as General Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross; Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky aka ""The Abomination""(A Hulk-wannabe). The CGI graphics were indeed top-notched. Better than Ang Lee's. But if it wasn't for Ang Lee's version 5 years ago, there wouldn't be another movie. So give that guy some credit! The battle scene between the Hulk(Norton) and the Army was classic. Taking out those Hummers, using the crude shields against the fire-power. The New York scene is great: Hulk vs. Abomination. Ilkied the part where the Hulk used the police car as ""boxing gloves"". The Abomination is stronger than the Hulk at first(He can lift 100 tons with ease), but he lacks the rage power. The Hulk's strength is unlimited(100 tons+) so he can kick serious butt with any enemy he faces. Dr. Samuel Sterns is another character to be reckoned with. He'll be known as the villainous Leader. The Hulk got to do more things in this movie: The Thunder Clap, and his trademark words: HULK SMASH!! Whch was voiced by the original, Lou Ferrigno which by chance plays a Security Guard who gets a free medium pizza. This movie is an improvement big time. Liked the cast, the storyline, the honorable mention of Bill Bixby in his earlier work. A younger Jack McGee who was played by the late Jack Colvin. This movie's got some 70's nostalgia there.

","Leave it to this drama lover to think that the new film The Incredible Hulk is more boring than Ang Lee's Hulk from 2003, despite the fact that the entire world hated that version because they said it was too slow. Maybe it was the departure in genre tone that Lee brought to the movie, making it a psychological tale of humanity rather than an action, comic-book romp, but I was pleasantly surprised after thinking it would just be Hulk-Smash over and over again. The funny thing is that knowing this new variation, from Transporter director Louis Leterrier, would be action packed, destruction heavy chaos, I was all for it. I liked the original film and wasn't quite sure this reboot was totally necessary, but I have to admit I was excited to see some fights, especially after hearing the end battle lives up to the hype, something that lacked in Iron Man and Batman Begins. Unfortunately, while the scuffles were pretty hectic and a lot of fun, everything else, most noticeably the middle third, dragged. It could be that the extremes were too far apart, leaving the testosterone-laden mini-warzones to go to scientific computer speak or blatant sexual tension between the past loves of Bruce Banner and Betty Ross, but I think it was just that those slow moments were too long and not the forte of the filmmakers. Leterrier handled the mix of drama and action much better in Danny the Dog, possibly due to the writing from auteur Luc Besson. Maybe it was Zak Penn's script, possibly it was the extreme highs of the fights creating even more extreme lows, either way, to me, Hulk was more consistent and a better film. That's not saying this new installment is bad; it has a lot going for it and if nothing else shows that the subject mater is still viable for a third film featuring The Leader as a villain.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

","This film is amazing! You can actually tell that the director, Edward Norton, and Tim Roth are fans of The Incredible Hulk unlike most Marvel films. The Incredible Hulk is such an underrated comic series, I would probably say Bruce Banner is the one of the most emotionally intriguing characters in Marvel. So what is your favorite Marvel film to date? X-Men? Spider-man? Iron Man? Well I'm a fan of all of those mentioned but I would say that The Incredible Hulk is better than the ones mentioned because it stays true to the comics/TV series. X-Men and Spider-man had lots of problems that I won't get into right now, and several are saying that Iron Man is the best Marvel movie now. Well, Iron Man may perhaps be the most ""fun"" film, but due to The Incredible Hulk having more interesting characters, great cinematography, and a great score make this an epic masterpiece. There are so many things in the film that made my inner-nerd geek-out, including cameos by the late Bill Bixby, Lou Ferrigno, and Stan Lee. I also loved the use of ""The Lonely Man"" and ""Hulk Smash"". The cast was also amazing in this...I believed that Edward Norton was a scientist on the run, that Liv Tyler and him had a past together and believable chemistry. I believed Tim Roth was an aging mercenary that was power-hungry and wanted to find the fountain of youth, and that William Hurt was a corrupt General...but to him Hulk is the bad guy. William Hurt totally gets into character here as always, he doesn't look or sound like himself, crazy.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

","The second film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a rebooted Hulk that pretends the 2003 version directed by Ang Lee never happened. One of the virtues of this attempt is that it doesn't spend much time on Hulk's origin story, mostly dispensing with it in the opening credits montage. I think this is the filmmakers at least acknowledging that, yes, we all saw this story a few years prior and we really don't need much detail. Another virtue is Tim Roth, whose rat-like Emil Blonsky injects some much needed verve into the proceedings, as does Tim Blake Nelson in the smaller role of Samuel Sterns. The rest of the cast is saddled with playing one note each in one-dimensional roles. Edward Norton and Liv Tyler seem like they would be more convincing as a pair of siblings than as former lovers. Neither are quite as somber or severe as Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly were in the same roles, but neither really manage to make Bruce Banner or Betty Ross terribly memorable. (We get a brief shout-out to Bill Bixby in the form of a television clip from ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father,"" but that just brought home the sad fact that we haven't had a finer Bruce Banner than Bixby in the 1970's Hulk TV show. Sorry, Mark Ruffalo, thanks for trying.) It seems that most of whatever creative energy was spent here went into rendering a convincing Hulk who can convincingly smash stuff and interact with human characters, and on that score the film succeeds. If only the human characters were more interesting, we might have something here. This isn't the worst film in the MCU (the worst, to date, would come next), but it is the most boring.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

","FIrst, Edward Norton is no Bill Bixby and second, how many ""Hulks"" does this movie need? This movie has several glaring weaknesses: first, the acting is laughable. Tim Roth must be considered as a candidate for the worst actor award for 2008. Second, the story is simplistic. Man is sick, man gets angry, man becomes a monster. Duh. Third, the special effects are almost cartoonish. Is this movie actually a cartoon interspersed with live acting? This confusion of style is now typical of most Hollywood action/sci-fi movies. Fourth, little character development. The characters are two-dimensional facsimiles directly out of the Hollywood potboiler mold. Liv Tyler's performance is utterly flat. It's not her fault; it's the material she has to work with. Betty Davis and Joan Crawford probably would have fared little better, but at least they would have given the role a little more flare. This movie is a remake of a remake and shows it, a really empty vessel. No originality. Intellectually empty.

","The first Hulk movie although had its moments was not the best. Its over development took way too long and rather than showing us a depressing movie , it just ended up being bleak and dull. When I heard Ed Norton had signed up for the role of Bruce Banner I was a bit hesitant at first but then after watching Bale as Batman and Cage as the Ghost Rider I welcomed the idea. After watching it , it easy to understand why Ed Norton can prove he is capable of standing toe to toe with the likes on Jhonny Depp , his ability to completely immerse him-self in a role really captivates. The best part about the The Incredble Hulk is that, it wastes no time getting straight into the action and rather than giving us a depressed man , we are given a desperate one driven. Right from start to finish it was a joy to check out , the special affects were brilliant as the director brings justice to the Hulk by making him the angry rampaging beast that he is rather than some sort of over grown mentally retarded child and truly at times he was scary. Tim Roth , Liv Tyler were both excellent at their roles and the fast pace of the movie truly left you wanting more. Another great thing about this movie was that is kept in spirit of the marvel comic universe and at the same time paid tribute to the original TV series listen to the music very carefully at one point and also starting a cross over into the marvel universe. My only complaint was that a little over cooked CGI made it look a little fake in places but that was me being too picky.

This is a pure matinée popcorn flick, the kind that Ang Lee's 2003 movie should have been but wan't. And in that respect, it is great! In terms of a hero movie, The Incredible Hulk probably isn't as satisfying as, say, Iron Man or Batman Begins, but it's up there.

It wasn't as good as other recent comic book movies e.g. Iron-man and Batman Begins The special effects were quite disappointing they were fine when with the hulk and the other monster but when it threw a jeep or whatever it looked much more poor. So overall the first Hulk may had better acting by Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly but the weak and long story which began to drive your patience and lack of the hulk was too much of a let down while The Incredible Hulk had most of what the first one lacked and was much more enjoyable and focused much more on Bruce Banner trying to get rid of the disease instead of understand it which was more enjoyable so The Incredible Hulk was better and a good summer movie.,/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

","This isn't a sequel to the 2003 Ang Lee/Eric Bana version, and compared to that rubbish, this is a great revamp of the popular green anti-hero monster, from director Louis Leterrier (Transporter 2). The story is set after the gamma rays accident with Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) hiding in the slums of Brazil, finding ways to control his anger to stop himself turning into the Hulk. Mainly though he is trying to find the cure to his condition with the help of a computer friend named ""Mr. Blue"", and with Gen. Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross (William Hurt) and his troops finding and chasing him, that could prove difficult. After an ""incident"", Bruce returns to America to find past love Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) to get her help to find a cure for his condition. Meanwhile, soldier Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) wants to become like Bruce after seeing his transformation and strength, but obviously more controlled. Bruce and Betty do eventually find ""Mr. Blue"", Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson) and they try to find the cure, or at least something to help control his condition. It is when insane-with-power Blonsky manages to turn into the big monster, or The Abomination, that Bruce decides he has to try and turn into Hulk again to defeat him, and then he runs away into hiding. The film ends with Gen. Ross being told by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), aka Iron Man, of a ""team"" being made, so this is either to be a continuation, or spin-off film about all the Marvel superheroes being brought together. Also starring Christina Cabot as Major Kathleen Sparr, Ty Burrell as Leonard, Lou Ferrigno as The Incredible Hulk and a Security Guard and Stan Lee as an Old Man. Norton is much more convincing than Bana, the supporting cast all do very well, the special effects are impressive, and the action and chases are much more engaging.

The plot is pure Hollywood - movie trying to put one action scene after another, but nothing innovative about cars being tossed around or chopper coming crashing down, or soldiers chasing Bruce Banner. What I'm complaining here is - it didn't capture the essence of the HULK. It was just a busy movie. HULK CG also didn't capture the subtle character of the HULK either. Good was Edward Norton as Dr. Banner. Liv Tyler as Betty Ross was somewhat of a mismatch also. I think they teach method acting to the actors, but do the actors really have the time to assimilate the characters that are fleshed out so well by Stan Lee ? Maybe that's not the point since Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow did a pretty credible job of portraying Tony Stark and Pepper Pots in Ironman. I think Ironman's success was it wasn't a Hollywood production, but Marvel had ownership of the production. So I guess my wish for the future of the HULK is - Marvel will take on the production, and nail the great story with subtleties that only the owner of that culture can put into the scenes.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

It is a shame that the MCU went for a more formulaic approach while designing their universe, it would be quite refreshing to see more bold and strange approaches to the genre.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

Edward Norton is not too bad as the Hulk and plays a troubled hero quite well. Liv Tyler is a great actress that did provide a few comic moments for this film. While I did believe that this film lagged in some areas, it did have a plot and purpose. The CGI was awesome and the Hulk probably looked more as a hero every time he appeared.

","The Hulk goes into the second round! This time, the broken scientist is played by Edward Norton. The successor of Eric Bana and Lou Ferrigno gives Bruce Banner a certain vulnerability and acts more human than its predecessors. It's just not a parade for Norton. Norton is coming for me completely under-challenged. With this reorientation of the comics Hulk, all the main characters were exchanged. Betty Ross is now played by Liv Tyler. Tyler doesn't really fit into the role. Her charisma comes more naively over and the prehistory with Bruce Banner, one does not look at her. Also General Ross was now taken over by William Hurt. Like his predecessor Sam Elliott, Hurt also has a good screen presence and costs it completely. The main opponent is Emil Blonsky this time and is played by Tim Roth. Although Roth is motivated by his role, and he also sees that he is buckling, he also seems a bit stunted. One could have afforded more freedom for Roth.
The director's post took over this time Louis Letterier. Letterier relies more on action and effects than on figure drawings. His predecessor Ang Lee had rather told it as a romantic comic book fairy tale. Although Lee was rather lengthy in his history, Letterier is rather superficial. My favorite scene is when Hulk hits Blunsky for the second time. Blunsky says dry: Is that all? And you can see that in this version a bit: Is that all? Was that all?

The movie stars Edward Norton as ""Bruce Banner"", Liv Tyler as ""Betty Ross"", Tim Roth as ""Emil Blonsky"" aka ""The Abomination"", William Hurt as ""General Thunderbolt"", and of course Lou Ferrigno providing the voice of The Incredible Hulk. -We all know that Bruce Banner was exposed to gamma radiation and so as a product of that became The Hulk. Instead of going through the origin again the film just dives into Bruce Banner hiding from the military since his body is technically ""military property"". The movie is kinda like a long chase sequence with a big fight at the end. That pretty much sums it up, but its better than it sounds. As the military searches for Banner, they decide to create another ""super soldier"" to combat The Hulk. This ""super soldier"" later becomes ""The Abomination"", which isn't good. -While the script is very action packed, the acting is what I really like. Edward Norton plays Bruce Banner as a mopey, regretful, scientist. I also forgot to mention Liv Tyler's and Norton's relationship is rather well done, its feels very heartfelt. Tim Roth is a pretty good villain too, as he gets creepier as the film progresses and its always fun to hear Lou Ferrigno belt out ""Hulk Smash!"". -One of the main problems that I have with the movie is they way the CGI was handled. While the first couple of scenes that featured The Hulk were dark and mysterious(well handled btw)the scenes that have him in open daylight are not particularly impressive, you can see all the contrasts of the CGI Hulk compared to the live-action sequences which clash a little bit. The CGI is fun to look at, but it can take you out of the film some when you see all this ridiculous stuff going down. -If you are a fan of the old TV series you will see many little shout outs to the fans, I won't spoil them for you, but there are a lot of them in there.

","This was an excruciating ""reboot"" of Ang Lee's ""Hulk"", which was a far superior movie in my opinion. Had I known that the writer of ""Inspector Gadget"" and ""Last Action Hero"" was responsible for this, I wouldn't have watched. This story really doesn't bother with the comic book Hulk, and mostly just takes from the TV show. The one nod to the comic book is the return of the Betty and General Ross characters (which could just as easily been lifted from the last movie, without referring to the comics at all). However, this Betty is pretty ineffectual as a character and the General is nothing more than a dimwitted antagonist. The General's brainless plan involves capturing the Hulk's alter ego, Bruce Banner, and returning him to the military for study. His reason is that Banner's blood is the result of the army's experiments to create a ""super soldier"". However, we find out in the first act that the army already has the serum for this super soldier and injects it into the Generals lackey, in order to better conquer the Hulk. So why are they trying to capture Banner then, instead of just shooting him in the head? Later, the General finds another doctor that's been helping Banner, and has a storehouse of his blood. So they have everything that they need and decide to just leave it in a lab with no more than one army official and a Royal British special ops grunt. This has got to be the stupidest general in the U.S. Army. I would love to see the report that he sends to his superiors in Washington after all of the unnecessary carnage that has occurred under his watch. These are just some of the major flaws with the poor writing and execution in this movie.

399,3 May 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7," Not 'Marvel' enough for most fans, this is an entertaining and character-focused flick that's better than it gets (or doesn't get) credit for being.
","'The Incredible Hulk (2008)' feels the least 'Marvel' of all the 'MCU', though the fact that a pseudo-series of non-directly linked films can have a 'feel' is slightly worrying and indicative of the greater 'Marvel problem' that I won't get into here'. It's actually quite refreshing, though, as it tells a rather insular and small tale that's true to the character, thanks in part to the rewrites done by the lead - who was such a fan of the eponymous hero he decided that he should be allowed to take a crack at the script. The piece also never really seems like it properly lets the hero loose, however. Indeed this version of the 'Hulk' is more of a character-study than anything else, a dark examination of the inner psyche that fuels his rage-induced transformation, and in this way it almost fails as the origin story it was intended to be. How this is supposed to directly transpose to Ruffalo's later, and arguably better, incarnation is anyone's guess. The picture as a whole is certainly not as bad as most people tend to give (or not give) it credit for and is actually quite interesting and entertaining throughout. It hits home the 'anger management' aspect that has essentially been lost, especially since 'Avengers Assemble (2012)' and its third-act reveal. This flick's issues mostly pertain to the cumbersome fact that it isn't quite 'Marvel' enough for most fans, especially when looked at retroactively. Really, it should be looked at as a stand-alone, though that's increasingly hard to do, and - even though it pales in comparison to what the studio would go on to do - it is a pretty strong piece in its own right. 7/10",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

","So the ""Gamma Bomb"" has done it's stuff and ""Banner"" (Edward Norton) has got to find some way to control his newly found, bodice-ripping powers - there must have been quite a bit of lycra in his trousers! Anyway, desperate for a cure and on the run from army general ""Ross"" (William Hurt) he alights on that man's daughter - and his ex-girlfriend - ""Betty"" (Liv Tyler) to help him sort himself out. ""Ross"" isn't the giving up easily type, though, and he engages the help of British killing machine ""Blonsky"" (Tim Roth). Tired of coming off second best in their battles, this man decides that he too must find a way to mutate - setting up the prospect of a battle royal between the two powerhouses of brute strength and terrible skin conditions. It's watchable, this, but I always found the ""Hulk"" stories amongst the most boring from amongst the comic characters. Norton enters into the spirit of things well enough, as does the always reliable Roth, but neither William Hurt nor the terribly sterile Tyler really add any richness to this otherwise procedural fantasy. The visual effects are efficient, the pyrotechnics likewise but the sum of these parts just doesn't really add up to much of an whole as it concludes in the only way it can.

","It's understandable why some might forget that the 2008 'reboot' of the 'Hulk' franchise is actually an MCU film, the second of Phase 1. First off, it was released the same year as 'Iron Man' and obviously didn't do as well as that film. But the main reason why the film isn't remembered much nowadays is because the film admittedly lacks much of a connection with the franchise now that Mark Ruffalo has taken over the role of Bruce Banner AKA 'The Hulk'. However, Edward Norton was a pretty good Banner prior to that. And whereas Ang Lee's 'Hulk' film was a bit too melodramatic, dark, and slow-paced, this film benefits from being more action-focused and a much lighter atmosphere. Sure that comes at the cost of the script (Norton and director Louis Leterrier were forced to cut a good chunk of scenes out (where's that director's cut?) under pressure not to be like the 2003 'Hulk') but with solid action sequences and an excellent lead performance, I do feel that 'The Incredible Hulk' is still a solid entry in the superhero genre.

I have a few comics floating around and I've read a few from libraries, but I am by no means an expert on the subject. So I guess you could call this a review from a semi-amateur. And Lastly, I am a simple man child. Put a lot of action and fun in a movie and I will be happy. This is evident from my love of movies like Transformers and X-Men: The Last Stand.

The direction this time is fast-paced and entertaining. And the only disappointment I can think of is that it just wasn't all that satisfying when the credits started rolling. It seemed like the movie needed a bit more of Hulk or something. However there is a more standout villain this time with Tim Roth who is this tough as nails bad-ass soldier. Seriously, he tries to take on the Hulk and actually lasts a while. Sometimes superhero movies need a standout villain to keep the momentum going. However I preferred Sam Elliott as Commander Ross over William Hurt and Jennifer Connelly over Liv Tyler as Betty. But that doesn't effect this movie all that much in that it has Edward Norton as Bruce Banner. The CGI is much better this time and Hulk doesn't look like some sort of green clay monster.

","After seeing part of the original disasterpiece churned out by Marvel in 2003 I was quite pessimistic towards the new ""Incredible Hulk"" movie. Yet again cinema screens would be going green as the new CGI superhero flexes his biceps for an hour, like some kind of perverse exercise tape. My opinion was swiftly changed however when I noticed that the cast included Edward Norton...and much to my surprise he had been cast as the weedier alter ego of The Hulk, Dr Bruce Banner. In my opinion Edward Norton has yet to star in a bad movie and contrary to my initial thoughts toward the new comic book flick, he maintains his ability to turn a potentially disastrous screenplay, into solid gold. Unlike the first attempt Marvel made at trying to bring the no brained, green lump to the big screen, this second try has clearly been thought through. The storyline was sharp and kept me interested past the first half hour, a feat many recent films have failed to do. The casting was excellent and Norton in particular steals the show as the disturbed scientist battling with himself to contain his hideous secret. The action scenes throughout were quite inventive, but used bits of car whenever possible, which quickly got old. I mean there's a limit to the ways a big green man can break more stuff with already broken stuff. The special effects as per se with comic book to film adaptations were brilliant and really brought the Hulk to life. The most amazing part in my mind however was the film's ability to make me like a character I've always hated as a child. I was never a fan of Bruce Banner and his large handed alter ego, but after seeing this newest addition to the marvel library I must say I have a new level of respect for the big guy.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

Then in 2003 I watched the HULK on DVD one night and I was a little disappointed, as a film I found it quite boring, and not on the same level as Spider-Man, Blade and X-Men that had been released prior to that. So here came the new rebooted HULK, which I'd only saw one trailer for and I thought it looked decent. I put the film on, and I enjoyed it from the get go, the scenes in Brazil are very gritty and Edward Norton does a good job letting us feel what he's feeling as he's trying to hold the HULK inside of him.

The films action set pieces are very well done, much improved on ANG LEE's version, and the dramatic scenes play out very well as well. The special effects are good, not perfect but very good.

","Coming off the 'incredible' ""Iron Man"", Marvel Comics produces ""The Incredible Hulk"". Unfortunately, 'incredible' is a slight exaggeration. Don't get me wrong, it's an entertaining film; far more than the 2003 ""Hulk"" film which tended to take itself too seriously. This is the Hulk. Hulk smash should be the top priority of a Hulk film. For this reason, this film is a reboot rather than a sequel to the 2003 film. The Hulk's origin is told through still photos and captions during the opening credits and this origin tends to echo more of the TV show than either the comics (gamma bomb exposure) or the previous film (a convoluted mess). The CGI seemed a little sub par. At times I felt I was watching a cartoon. At least they rendered the Hulk a darker tone instead of the Shrek coloured green from the previous film. I suspect it will look better on the small screen. Comic fans will likely enjoy the loads of references to Marvel Comics characters, most notably, Captain America's super soldier formula. The film boasts an 'incredible' cast and everyone does a more than adequate job.

In Coleman Francis's original (which quite clearly inspired Stan Lee and Jack Kirby), Tor Johnson (""a prehistoric beast in the Nuclear Age,"" according to Francis himself) limps arthritically through the desert (""a hundred and ten in the shade- and no shade,"" Francis the narrator intones- no doubt remembering those long, hot days in the desert getting it all on film) after having been transformed by a nuclear explosion into a lumbering Hulk. Time had clearly taken its toll on Johnson, but there he was, lurching around in his ragged shirt, making inarticulate growling noises. At one point, vice-presidential wannabe (and real life Stepford Wife) Sarah ""Six Pack"" Palin puts in an appearance. It didn't save the movie (nor will it save the Republican Party), but at least THE BEAST OF YUCCA FLATS was an honest attempt at telling the story of THE INCREDIBLE HULK OF YUCCA FLATS.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

I almost liked Liv Tyler as Betty, since she had some scenes where she got to show some strength of spirit. There were some technical aspects that were well done also, the most impressive being the overhead shots of the Brazilian slums. I had to look up whether or not this was a real place because the movie made it look so incredible. The abomination looked terrible, and the ending fight in Toronto (actual filming location) was pretty lame.

Ed Norton does try very hard in his role of Bruce Banner, in a good way thankfully, as he is quite possibly the only decent actor throughout. Liv Taylor is comically bad in the film, and every other supporting actor and character is quite honestly as stale as they come. The CGI has not aged well, and at times feels like you are watching a cutscene from an xBox 360 game.

","A wrestling movie with a green guy gets boring after a while; I guess that's why the brainiacs at the studio hired Edward Norton to play the wrestler in the non-wrestling scenes. A film version of the Lou Ferrigno- and Bill Bixby-starring TV series, this is a reasonable waste of time that outstays its welcome once the wrestling takes over. Norton, a troubled fellow who's carrying a dangerous chemical in his blood, is hiding in Brazil from government agents who want to use him as a weapon. As you already know, when he gets angry he gets violent. He starts throwing stuff around and deflecting bullets. When the government, personified by William Hurt, learns of Norton's whereabouts, they ambush his hideout and shoot lots of bullets that get deflected. Tim Roth, a professional soldier, is brought in as a secret weapon who also likes to wrestle and cause mayhem; only difference is, he's bigger and uglier. Like most Marvel material, this is predictable and inspired by a thousand other stories. The climactic showdown is just another video game featuring violent pounding and mass destruction. Having decent actors in clichéd parts adds credibility, I guess, to this bloated, overproduced exercise, but it just felt like lots of noise to me.

First of all because its story is not an integral part of the MCU story: you can understand the bigger picture without ever seeing this film. Secondly, Norton said goodbye to the role of Hulk after this film. Which we should be thankful for: talking about miscasting. Norton, as does the film as a whole, takes things much too serious. The key strength of the MCU films is its lightheartedness. That is sorely lacking here. Another poor choice of casting is Roth as Marine/Commando. He is a great actor and believable as a psychopath but NOT as a highly trained and lethal Marine. The main problem with Hulk is that from a dramatic point of view the character becomes uninteresting once he becomes Hulk. He is a great supporting character, just not as interesting to carry a film.

But it is a comic book movie, and if you can suspend your disbelief for that, it is not too much further a stretch to just take the CGI for what it is: that is, a part of a nicely paced, entertaining chase film, with moderate character development and substance, that happens to be incorporated with comic book characters. The good guys most likely win--barely; and in the sequel we'll find out if the proverbial 'beast' or 'mutant' will be reunited with his 'girl-next-door'.

514,10 July 2014,khanbaliq2,7," This dramatic and rousing film features the Hulk that everyone knows and loves.
","When The Incredible Hulk came out back in 2008 I watched it in a movie theater. I remember thinking that this is the best film portrayal of the Hulk yet. It's by no means a perfect film but it gets a number of things right. It definitely has replay value. Casting Edward Norton as Bruce Banner was a curious but inspired move. Norton is a good actor. In this film his Banner is a likable and charismatic character from the beginning. This reluctant hero gets a dramatic treatment like never before in film. In addition to the well-handled romance between Banner and Betty Ross (a perfectly cast Liv Tyler) we're also shown how he relates to his work. Since this is a beginnings story Banner can't yet control the Hulk and he wants to rid himself of the green monster. This drags down the action scenes a bit because the Hulk fights against Thunderbolt Ross' (William Hurt) army units. It's not very exciting stuff because he isn't facing a supervillain. So he smashes some armored cars and brings down a chopper. Only at the end of the film do we get to see some real Hulk action when he faces Emil Blonsky. But, surprisingly, the action involving the Hulk isn't even the best aspect of this film. It's more interesting to see Norton play Banner while he's on the run from Ross. The inclusion of some good natured humor is also a plus. Hurt lent an air of respectability to the film in his role as General Ross just as Jeff Bridges did in Iron Man (2008). It's unfortunate that Norton didn't get to reprise his role as Banner in The Avengers (2012) because he made Banner a believable character. In The Avengers Banner is often used for comic relief while the Hulk is used only for action. Sure, the fight featuring the Hulk and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is exciting. But when written by Joss Whedon and played by Mark Ruffalo Banner has none of the mystery and charisma that Norton brought to the role. Norton said that his dispute with Marvel producers was about money, while Kevin Feige claimed that they didn't get along with Norton. Perhaps Norton disagreed with Whedon's comical take on the character, or perhaps Feige thought that the box office returns were below expectations and decided not to spend more time and effort on Hulk films. It's too bad because out of all the Marvel superheroes I was most excited about seeing the Hulk. The Incredible Hulk achieved what it set out to do. Norton and director Louis Leterrier (The Transporter, Now You See Me) successfully revived the character and did it in a smart way. The CGI was provided by Rhythm And Hues and not by Industrial Light & Magic, the company that created the visual effects for Ang Lee's Hulk (2003). They succeeded in making the Hulk a vivid on-screen presence. Craig Armstrong provided a memorable music score, and if you want to get it it's available on two discs. There's a significant amount of footage that wasn't included in the final cut of the film. For example, the original opening, where Banner comes to the Arctic to commit suicide was cut out. When the scene ends, in an instant the frozen body of Captain America is partially seen in the ice. Some of the flashbacks that were placed across the film were compressed to the film's start. I would have liked seeing these in the final cut though. I recommend The Incredible Hulk. It's one of my favorite Marvel Studios films.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

","First off, Edward Norton is a much better Bruce Banner, and actor than Eric Bana. He gives one of the best performances for a comic book film easily. Their are other great actors in this film such as Liv Tyler, William Hurt, Tim Roth, and more. But what makes this movie is obviously the action. It's not even action, it's hyper action. It's like Live Free or Die Hard action. The battles are so intense in this film especially the final fight between the Hulk and Abomination. Now for the story, it is quite entertaining and the dialog works really well. The film is well executed and shows Hulk can do so much more than the atrocity from Ang Lee. Now the flaws in this film are minor, such as how sometimes the CGI Hulk looks incredible but half of the time he looks so unrealistic. Also, there are some parts where the story drags a bit such as the beginning of the film. But besides those small complaints, this is a great summer flick that will be enjoyed by most people but mainly enjoyed by the people who are really into the action genre.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

","""The Incredible Hulk"" smashes onto the screen with Edward Norton embodying the green rage of Bruce Banner. The acting, particularly Norton's portrayal, adds layers to the tormented scientist on the run. The film editing captures the kinetic energy of Hulk's rampages while also delving into Banner's internal struggles. The strength lies in the film's ability to blend action-packed sequences with moments of introspection, showcasing the human side of the monstrous hero. However, the weakness may be found in the occasional pacing hiccups that interrupt the otherwise thrilling narrative. The music, though not as iconic as other superhero scores, complements the Hulk's destructive ballet. With a 7/10 rating, ""The Incredible Hulk"" stands as a green-hued chapter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, delivering smashing entertainment with a dash of soul-searching.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

Except for being too green, the Ang Lee version more closely matched my recollection of the comic. But, after this new film gets going, the visual appearance of the Hulk grew on me and I cannot find fault. In the Ang Lee version, one was too aware that one was watching a comic book. In this version, though you know its a comic book story, the characterizations and raw action lend the kind of realism that comic book movies *should* strive for. I admit bias towards the two principle actors, Edward Norton and Liv Tyler, but I really think that they delivered emotional performances that did justice to the characters and the film. Tim Roth's performance was also top notch; even as a mere mortal, his character exuded pure menace. If you're a Tim Roth fan (as I am), I don't think you'll be disappointed.

","After receiving harsh reviews for 2003's ""Hulk"", starring Eric Bana, Marvel immediately decided to reboot the Hulk franchise with 2008's ""The Incredible Hulk"", this time, starring Edward Norton as the giant, raging green monster. Now, the Hulk isn't my favorite Marvel superhero, but is rather considered as one of the coolest superheroes. Set with a new back-story on Bruce Banner, a.k.a The Hulk, Banner travels from place to place, to help find a cure to prevent himself from becoming the Hulk, while making sure to not be spotted by the military. Although this isn't the best portrayal of the Hulk that I've seen in a while, Edward Norton does deliver a fine quality and relativity to the Bruce Banner character. But the visual effects perform a weak job at making the Hulk effect look like Edward Norton. Besides Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, William Hurt, Ty Burrell, and Tim Blake Nelson round up the rest of the supporting cast. Tim Roth shares a pretty decent portrayal of Emil Blonsky, a.k.a The Abomination, and William Hurt does his best playing General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross, obsessed in capturing the Hulk. But Liv Tyler brings out the weakest performance of the entire cast, playing Norton's love-interest, Elizabeth Ross. She spits out her dialouge in such a cheesy manner, and she delivers bland execution to go along with it. I honestly don't know why she's even in this movie! This movie does deliver some impressive action scenes that are quite enjoyable to watch, but they're placed in the wrong place at the wrong time. These scenes are just placed in random elements of the plot, and they don't fit appropriately into the story as it progresses. It feels like it's just there to promise the audience for there to be an action movie. For example, the final battle scene between the Hulk and the Abomination was entertaining to watch, but it just didn't develop into the plot precisely, so that the audience can see a fight scene already. But those scenes are enjoyable to watch, however, and worth the price of admission. ""The Incredible Hulk"" isn't one of the best Marvel films I've seen in my life, but it's still quite an entertaining movie that sometimes knew what it wanted to be. I just wished that the movie would have been so much better at arranging the action scenes at a more precise moment, fitting perfectly in the story itself.

","This movie is a good example for great casting in a mediocre film. Edward Norton was a really good fit for the Hulk/Bruce Banner, but the movie didn't really give him enough to work with. The villain in this movie is a literal abomination. So dull and boring, that nothing could make him interesting. The visual effects seem pretty dated and the movie isn't shot very nicely. Plus, the fact that he doesn't turn into the Hulk when he is angry, but when he is excited makes it seem really weird. Wow. Enough from the negative. Even though Edward Norton isn't given too much to work with, he makes the best of it and you can see it. The action is pretty decent, and the relationship between Bruce and Betty is also fine.

Writer/Star Edward Norton strikes out twice, first with a painful screenplay - everything from the romance to the Lou Ferrigno cameo to Ty Burrell's character feels forced, clichéd or unnecessary - and secondly with a dull performance. Norton is miscast as Banner, unbelievable both as a scientist and a man concealing his rage and inner demon. He is comedic when the situation calls for seriousness, and at all times bears a vacant expression unworthy of his talent. Accomplished actors like Hurt and Roth overact frequently, to the point where it is obvious that they are struggling with the stupidity. Visually, the Hulk looks like an unfinished rendering of the final product, and the action sequences are well choreographed but so full of explosions that there is nothing fun to be gained. The Incredible Hulk is an incredible disappointment, with as little character development and as many explosions, clichés and mindless action scenes as to be expected from a poor film in Michael Bay's filmography.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

The biggest problem for me was to overcome the prospect to see someone like Norton(who is really a magnificent actor) to start in a movie like that. It was truly a challenge for him and for us- the movie fans. But it all ended being good, like the happy ending we used to see in most of the movies. First of all Norton really fitted in the role, he was good, presenting to the public the complex figure of Bruce Banner- the big green guy.Because portraying a super hero is truly a hard job to do. Even if you are a fan of the particular monster, spider or something else. Maybe the biggest drawback of this movie was that you just can't enjoy the full power of the Hulk. Most of the scenes were really great, the special effects were on its top level, but still the battle's were short. Maybe because there were so intense that i didn't followed the passing time, I don't know, but it just felt like that.

","Bruce Banner is a man on the run in this one starting with the nice location of Brazil. This film isn't bad, but doesn't have the strongest of plots compared with other comic book films. Edward Norton does a worthy Job of Bruce Banner and his love interest Betty Ross Liv Tyler shows nice chemistry. You feel the emotional depth of seperation and loneliness for Bruce. You can empathise with his loneliness and issues of contamination due to the gamma radiation as he is hunted down by general thunderbolt Ross. Bruce Banner is harmless, intelligent, reserved and condemned from society to an extent worried about anger and rage and how to prevent this. His only friend at first is online in the name of Mr Blue. Somebody he has never even met. The imprint of what modern society has become in some cases of today world. He goes about a general warehouse job in isolation trying to keep what's inside at bay. Tim Roth plays one of the army soldiers trying to take out the Hulk and ultimately becomes the Abomination. We can see the transformation in Tim Roth as he manages what's inside and the inevitability of it taking over. Although even before, he had a taste for destruction. Emulating parts of the King Kong story and how the general refuses to see anything but a monster inside the Hulk. General thunderbolt Ross has an obsession with weaponising the gamma radiation incident by injecting it out of Banner. Only his daughter can see more to the Hulk and who he truly is inside, Bruce Banner.

I just don't know if Norton would have gone on as long as the MCU has. I feel like he'd rather being trying new roles than just playing the Hulk over and over again.

Sadly, after the first third of the film, it started to take a downward spiral, incorporating a faster pace, and a few subplots that could've worked, but had tough transitions, and a poor execution. You can either go one of two ways to make a Hulk film. You can either make countless, high octane action scenes, with minimal character moments, or try to write good characters, and balance the action.

I admit that I'm a bit of a fan of Norton and I find Miss Taylor quite an attractive woman, so I decided to watch this movie right after my terrible experience with Iron Man 1 and 2. The first 10 minutes of The Incredible Hulk were already better than both Iron Man films. It feels, somehow, more mature, whereas Iron Man is a big budget shallow film directed to teenagers and people who don't give a damn about anything but simple action and special effects. The 2008 Hulk gives you a deeper look into the character of Bruce Banner, and his inner struggles fighting to control the green beast known as The Hulk. This alone makes the whole difference compared to, let's say, the narcissist and egomaniac Tony Starks in Iron Man. The Hulk is also packed with action and, although the special effects aren't as mind-blowing as in Iron Man, they will keep you stuck to your seat. The film loses a bit towards the last 30 min, although the very (open) end leaves you with a nice feeling. I also like the crossover stuff in it (The Leader, The Avengers...), even when that means the appearance of Tony Starks.

","This movie was awesome! For those who think this movie to be a sequel to Ang Lee's 2003 The Hulk... think again. This movie is a reboot, and a freakin good one too. The Incredible Hulk is more or less progressed with the story, not the characters. Edward Norton is far better than Eric Bana as Bruce Banner a.k.a. the Hulk. Liv Tyler is not bad as Bruce Banner's girlfriend, Betty Ross, but for some reason and I don't know why, but I like Jennifer Connelly as her in Ang Lee's version better. Tim Roth plays a good bad guy, Emil Blonsky a.k.a. Abomination and the William Hurt plays General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross, who isn't half bad at the part. Bruce Banner has been on the run for five years and he lives in South Americ, trying to find a cure for what turns him into the big, green, fighting machine. The U.S. Army finds him and he has to go back to the United States to find the cure. He meets up with his old girlfriend Betty and they go to this scientist who Bruce had been talking to on his computer so he could help him find a cure. Emil Blonsky, after going up against the Hulk twice for the U.S. Army, wants to become as strong as he is. After Bruce and Betty are taken away in a helicopter, the scientist, Dr. Samuel Sterns who becomes the Leader, a villain, in the comics, injects Emil with the same stuff Bruce has in him. Emil becomes Abomination and he and the Hulk fight in a battle that is full of smashing and punching and kicking and more punching and so on and so forth. The action scenes in this movie are some of the best I've seen in most comic book movie adaptations.

","The Incredible Hulk was one of the very first films to come to the MCU and is often forgotten by most for certain reasons. For starters, where the MCU was at that time and where it stands today, but just because this film is forgotten by most, does that make it a bad film? Absolutely not. Honestly this film is highly underrated in my opinion and is one of the only Incredible Hulk films we have ever gotten. Edward Norton as Bruce Banner I thought actually did a great job portraying the title character, but the reason this film is often forgotten and people try to forget it is, because he gets recast with Mark Ruffalo after this film as the MCU's Hulk. The fact that Mark Ruffalo was actually going to portray the character in this film before Edward Norton was definitely one of marvels biggest mistakes they made at the beginning of the MCU, but since this film is forgotten by most and the fact that they did cast him as Hulk later on, makes this film not matter to the MCU as much. Now as for the other cast members, Liv Tyler as Betty Ross I thought was great and definitely was my favorite portrayal of Betty Ross. Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky/Abomination was also great and is definitely my favorite villain in any Incredible Hulk project that has been made. William Hurt as General Thunderbolt Ross was also a stand out of the film and helped make this movie as great as it was. If there are really any cons I have, it's I felt the last twenty minutes was rushed a bit and just knowing nowadays what would end up happening with the characters recast. I am glad though that the current MCU as of 2023 has and will be bringing certain characters from this movie back in future projects that I can't wait to see again. Overall, The Incredible Hulk is definitely one of the more forgettable films of the MCU, but is definitely probably the best Incredible Hulk film we as filmmakers have gotten to date, with its incredible story, talented cast, and great action sequences.

Ang Lee's movie screenplay is not bad, but the problem is that it is too much long and it isn't a screenplay that fans expect for this type of movie. Industrial Light & Magic didn't make it a bad Hulk effect, but it would be easier to use a body building and paint it. Rhythm and Hues made a Hulk that stands up to his appearance in comics.

However, the scripting and directing was well done. The progression from not seeing the Hulk transformation at all in Brazil, slightly showing it in the University, and finally the full on transformation in Sterns lab. The visuals were able to capture the torment of his transformation with spine chilling accuracy(shoulders dislocating and relocating). And finally the underlying idea that Hulk wasn't completely invulnerable. He wasn't that overconfident invulnerability we see in Superman(where he can calmly fight crime). The Hulk had signs of weakness which keeps the character grounded through the movie. Finally, the movie was able to capture the potential for good and the idea that will power can overcome other struggles in your body was depicted very well.

Everything about it felt a little off. First of all, I found much of the fault to be in the characterization of Bruce Banner. He felt very distant throughout. Yes, I understand he needs to be mellow, as to show the significant difference between him as Bruce and him as the Hulk, but even so. Edward Norton was not enjoyable to watch in this role. In addition, it really didn't feel like a superhero movie. I didn't see the Hulk as a hero and the villain didn't show up until the last twenty minutes. I did enjoy the small cameo by Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark. That for me was the highlight. Another cool thing about the film is that Lou Ferrigno, the original voice of the Hulk, is still lending his voice for this role.

The film picks up five years after its disappointing predecessor, complete with a brand new cast, director and slightly altered back story. Confused?

","Comparing 'The Incredible Hulk' to other MCU films, it doesn't quite feel part of the same universe, unlike most fans of the MCU, I actually found this film really interesting and a fun one to go back and watch. The recast of Bruce Banner from Edward Norton to Mark Ruffalo in later films is a main reason why it feels so separate from the MCU, the only real connection is General Ross and Tony Stark in the after credit scene.

He writes on his computer to some strange, mysterious Mr. Blue, who may help.

The movie is really silly. William Hurt - mix of Sam Elliot and Steven Seagall - with ""evil eyebrow"" , plays ""general"" who wants to get Hulk. He, for some reason, instead getting a whole platoon of navy seals, or rangers or other commandos, gets Emil Blonsky, who is some kind of mercenary or something. Blonsky gets hooked on catching Hulk and gets himself injected. After the injection he can run like the wind (the scene is exactly like the one from original Superman, when young Clark tries to be faster than train) - silly. Edward Norton runs like a girl, looks miserable and can travel without a passport and green card from Guatemala to Virginia USA in about 2 weeks.

770,20 October 2010,TheKarateSpider,8," Unfairly Overlooked, correct way to adapt a comic book to movie.
","As a die-hard Superhero/Comic Book movie fan reviewing this movie puts me in a strange position, it raises more questions than allows me to give answers. First of all, The Incredible Hulk is my favourite superhero. I was weened on the 70's/80's classic Bill Bixby/Lou Ferrigno TV series (still awesome after 30 odd years) and the fun 1982 Animated series. I had some terrific Hulk toys and when it came to reading comics i cut my teeth with Peter Davids run on the title. However that doesn't mean that i will view this movie with rose (or jade?) tinted glasses, because i was greatly deflated and bewildered by Ang Lee's Hulk (2003), see my review for details. I honestly believe that Louis Letterriers The Incredible Hulk, is a great adaptation of the comics, an entertaining piece of cinema and a faithful tribute to all the great writers and artists who have worked on the comics, and a nice way of acknowledging the great work Bill Bixby, Lou Ferrigno and Kenneth Johnson did on the TV series. Im confused as to why it didn't find a much bigger audience. With one of the great actors of our time, Edward Norton playing the lead character AND writing the screenplay, i thought a bigger buzz would have been generated by cinema goers. I think the answer as to why the movie wasn't as popular or as successful as say the X-Men or Iron Man movies is two fold: I think Ang Lees take on the character left a bad taste in the mouths of movie goers who went to see the first movie with genuine enthusiasm and felt left down and had no interest in a sequel. Secondly i think the fact that The Hulk himself is a CGI creation puts distance between audiences and the character, like Lou Ferrigno said "" A CGI Hulk cant shake your hand and sign an autograph"" and i think this is a potent factor in audiences dis interest. Hopefully by the time of Joss Whedons Avengers and subsequent Hulk movies effects will be so stellar that The Hulk will be a truly amazing CGI creation. I honestly believe this movie was unfairly over looked in a summer that brought us the return of Indiana Jones, Robert Downey JR as Iron Man and Heath Ledgers Joker facing off with the return of The Dark Knight. Edward Norton is fantastic as Bruce Banner, he brings the every man qualities that is vital to the part, nicely echoing Bill Bixbys classic performance. He also has the right air of a scientist, a fugitive on the run and a man who has difficulty controlling the great power and destruction he is capable of. His screenplay (for which he went uncredited!) is neat, with every thing needed for a fun, genre adventure movie present, with a nice blend of the exotic and breaking a few conventions. Norton really makes you believe in Banner and care for him and i for one was looking forward to seeing him in The Avengers and subsequent Hulk movies so it is a BIG shame he wont be reprising the role, but i eagerly await Mark Ruffalo as Banner (another case of great casting and hopefully 3rd time lucky). The supporting cast bring a lot to the movie, Liv Tyler as Betty Ross and William Hurt as Thunderbolt are instantly more believable and relatable in this movie than both Jennifer Connolly and Sam Elliot in Ang Lee's film. There is a real nice sense of romance and love between Tyler and Norton and something insanely driven in Hurt's. Tim Blake Nelson as Sterns gives a strong impression of the unhinged craziness of a supervillain and i would place him in the same category as Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor, in that when the twist comes it is really unexpected. The only problem i had casting wise was Tim Roth as Blonsky/Abomination in that i did and do think he was unsuited to the role and that this one aspect of the movie needed a classic action movie heavy, someone who could go over the top and i just think Roths transition to Abomination is wobbly. The CGI realisation of The Hulk this time is spot on, he is designed the correct way in terms of height and scale, he is the right shade of green and manages to look mighty when in full rage. The only real problem i have with the movie is entirely down to Marvel, it seems they scaled down Edward Norton/Louis Letterrier's epic vision in order to accommodate the running time and i think this has the effect that it seems like it is trying to fit itself into a pop corn movie skin rather than being epic on the scale of The Dark Knight as it would appear was intended, and i can understand Norton being in conflict with Marvel for this reason. That said The Incredible Hulk is a great tribute to the classic comic book work of Stan Lee,Jack Kirby, Peter David Etc, and with its use of The Lonely Man theme and nice (cameo) from Bill Bixby, the fans who have grown up with and love the TV series. Letterrier gave us a movie we can enjoy with good pace and the right amount of excitement and thrills and his movie is an overlooked gem.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

It's not really a bad film, it's just a bit dull - the moves are predictable, the characters aren't engaging, and it doesn't leave any kind of impression beyond 'I guess that was ok.'

781,17 April 2015,firstruleofmethclub,6," Arguably the weakest MCU movie
","Dubbed as a ""re-quel"", The Incredible Hulk was first released in 2008, and now, I'm here to review it in the line of Marvel films I'm getting through a the moment. I always like to think of films individually, but with the Marvel Cinematic Universe getting so big, that can be rather difficult to do. So though I may comment on films in relation to their sequels, remakes, prequels, spin-offs, parodies and the like, know that my final score out of ten is always based purely on the films merits, or lack thereof. It's pretty crazy seeing Edward Norton (American History X, Fight Club, Red Dragon) as a very scrawny Bruce Banner, considering that he turns into the giant, muscular Hulk. But to me it totally worked. As an interesting side-note, Norton co-wrote the script, which may or may not have contributed to his being ousted as Banner for any future films after the movie was released. Not because the script is particularly awful or anything, but because as a general rule production doesn't like actors ""getting all up in dey grillz"" half way through. Although it's not like Norton's never done this sort of thing before. Under-appreciated Tim Roth (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction) is also excellent (as far as I'm concerned) playing the role of Abomination/Emil Blonsky. Interesting side-note, no, he's not related to Eli Roth, who's also a friend and actor of Quentin Tarantino and his films. Ultimately, The Incredible Hulk is a fine film, but it just can't stand up to the superior writing and character building of Thor, Iron Man or Iron Man 2. Liv Tyler (The Strangers, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Armageddon) is rather a non-event as supposed love interest Betty Ross. And William Hurt (A History of Violence, Dark City) as semi-antagonist General Thunderbolt Ross, is nothing but annoying (although it is pretty cool to see just how much they got him looking like the comic book character he is based on. You would've thought that having a modern day Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde story to run with, backing from the success of the franchise you've got supporting you, that it would be easy to write strong characters, unfortunately, it's not the case. And while the action sequences are cool, and the fighting is possibly some of the best that Marvel's come up with, it's not enough to bring this film up to the standards of the other 3. The film lacks the flair I'm sure everyone would be expecting, and while it's a perfectly good monster-movie movie, perhaps a completely separate Super Hero origin story would have been better than the overly-CGI- ridden quasi-sequel to 2003's The Hulk that we ended up with. 60% -Gimly",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

There is really no suspense, and my heart rate didn't get going above normal once.

Some people dislike this movie's lack of a superhero movie feeling, or for better analogy the feeling of a ""Classic Hulk Movie,"" but that's really not what the Hulk's first outing should be about. It should have the same thematic journey as the comics, which of course this movie had as the comic makers made it this time. It's the same problem with Batman, they've never gotten his character right with the same flawless thematic formation as the comic version, instead creating their own version that's almost in name, action, and task only but essentially not Batman. The Hulk movies and shows ALL had this same problem, their version being Bruce is smart and Hulk is dumb and end of story, when it really is not that black and white and fundamentally not the Hulk. This movie finally got it right, and I think it will be better remembered in retrospect just because people aren't used to a Hulk movie that has as deep an insight into both the characters of the Hulk and Banner as this movie and were busy looking for an action movie, which the Hulk's first outing should not be and thankfully wasn't.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

","Contrary to popular belief, The Incredible Hulk is very much a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or the MCU. The fact is that this is the lowest earning movie within the MCU and not had not been received well by critics and audience alike. A lot of people choose to ignore the existence of Ed Norton's Hulk which is why this movie could as well be called the ""The Forgotten MCU Movie"". In my opinion, this film was far from being a complete disaster and did manage to hit a lot of right notes. For example ,the portrayal of Bruce Banner's adversaries and his struggles to keep the Hulk at bay should be appreciated. Ed Norton ,being the commendable actor he is, did a good enough job playing Bruce Banner. We even get to see Hulk at his peak power while battling Abomination ,which we have yet to see with Mark Ruffalo's Hulk. So why did the movie not work? Before the final battle which would peak the interest of any movie watcher, the rest of the film is fairly conventional and predictable and the plot doesn't have a lot to offer besides showing Bruce running away from the military and fighting tanks and soldiers.
Still, a couple of mentions about S.H.I.E.L.D and a Tony Stark cameo in the end confirm that it was intended to be the second installment in the MCU, right after the release of Iron Man. Ed Norton wasn't interested in playing the character for long and that is why Mark Ruffalo was brought in and the rest is history.

","It Is Obvious that the Hulk of 2003 was a film that many considered weak.
Hulk of 2008, instead, We Have a good interpretation of Edward Norton as a man who desperately does not want to become the Hulk, and goes to Brazil to study under a control of the breath to control his anger, and not become the Green Man, Shrek (?. And we have Liv Tyler in the midst of shaky sympathy. Banner's Brazilian stay begins with an astonishing shot: from an aerial point of view, we fly higher and higher above one of the River hills, seeing hundreds, thousands of small houses built on top of each other, all scratching air.
This is the ""City of God."" In the neighborhood, and as far as I could see, we're seeing the real, not CGI. The director lets the filming run longer than any reasonable requirement of the plot; My bet is that he was as astonished as I am. And let it run because it's incredibly amazing. The scenes involving Banner in Brazil are well conceived, although when it accidentally contaminates a bottled soda with its blood, the film does not really deal with the consequences when consuming the drink. United States. The contamination gives general Ross his clue to the whereabouts of Banner, and Army troops raze the hell of the City of God; Throughout the film, the general deploys his power of fire so recklessly that one wonders if he has a superior. , and if you ever have to account for the dozens, hundreds, thousands, who die while your boys are shooting at the Hulk without any favorable effect.
Enter Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), a marine that general Ross recruits because he is more cruel and deadly than anyone. Blonsky leads the chase in Rio. Later, Dr. Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson), associate researcher of Banner, is forced to inject a little juice from Hulkie to Blonsky, preparing a titanic battle on the roof of Harlem between Hulk and Blonsky. And This battle, as I have suggested, is waged relentlessly, taking as our first victim our patience. ""Iron Man"", the best spiritual Companion of this film, also ends with a clash between an original and a copycat, but involves two opponents who know who they are and why they are fighting.
When you put yourself to it, like a fictitious creature, the Incredible Hulk is as limited as a bad drunk. It Can be fun to be around when You're sober, but when You drink too much, You feel sorry for the boy.

The film was released in the same year as the first Iron Man, but was not received as warmly. Box office failure and defeat from critics followed. Part of the movie deserved it. Weak plot and dynamics - general characteristics of the movies of the Hulk. There was also very little action, always a hallmark of the green giant. Yes and no villain points clearly not added. But the Incredible Hulk has its advantages, and the main, in my opinion, of them - Edward Norton and Liv Tyler.
Yes, Bruce banner and Betty Ross in their performance came out slightly cardboard, but that's the fault of the weak script, not the actors themselves. Norton and Tyler got the best they could out of him. When you look at them, you believe they love each other, but there will always be the Hulk between them. I also liked General Ross, played by William hurt. I really hope to see the Red Hulk someday. And Stan Lee, as always, is beautiful. And after the credits, Tony stark appears.

This had conflicting ideas between the filmmakers some wanted a shorter version of the film and others wanted a longer more fleshed out character study of Bruce Banner. We ended up getting the shorter version which isn't all bad but I wish we would have gotten an in depth origin story of Bruce Banner/Hulk which I do not think we will ever get. Though part of me wish we got to see a full scene of the origin of the MCUs Hulk it is smart in this shorter version of this film they show the origin in the opening credits and jump right to the chase of Bruce running from General Ross and desperately needing to find a cure. This film also has pretty good villains' with General Ross and the Abomination they are pretty fleshed out as well and you spend a good amount of time with them. There a also nice small touches that add a great deal of tension to the film such as Bruce's heart monitor and his blood getting out. The action sequences are very well done as well and are memorable. The performances are good from every actor no standout great performances but also no particularly bad ones either.

Close up scene were better but action scenes were easy to see as CGI both the Moster and background looked like a comic book page. Iron man did a better job of blending it all together.

I hear he hard man to work because perfectionist. I think no. He can't act in this. Like he read lines from inside hand and shows emotion like sushi chef serving twitchy, still alive fish to fat tourist. Why tourists so fat? Nobody fat in films. So film looking bit tired. CGI got better now and big tantrum-monster look like green sock floating around in washing machine. Funny though, he more emotion than Edward Norton. OK, so this Incredible Hulk but another film called Hulk recent. This made to fit better into avenger film (why bother, film suck so hard it could pull monkey through 20 yards of garden hose?) So it is transparent and little bit embarrass. Like advert for worse film coming. Expect temper-monster to shout ""Give me your money or I punch you in 3D."" No canon to this film and begin only flashback in credits. Borrow little bit from other and from old TV series, even gamma radiate part copy from TV so audience can relate. Don't want to relate, want to be entertain. So monster do monster things. Blow up stuff, roar a lot. Nobody cares. Hollywood can't understand basic thing. We don't care. Give us character we relate. We invest, we want best outcome for them. Green temper-monster big version of annoy actor who entire facial expression is movement of left eyebrow by half centimeter. is not good. We don't care. Pause to make tea. We forget film is paused and not because tea full of special drink made in bathtub. Usually that but not this time. And his girlfriend. Her lips massive now, she been kissing angle grinder? She eat mushroom soup? She talk soft and with acting range of a hair dryer. She like on sleeping drugs all way through. She act like audience act when they watch this. So film a bit different from Captain iron man. Look a bit different and have own style. That is good, like that. Ends nowhere and hint at avengers in credits make no sense with other film meant to connect. Plot hole you can throw a tank thought. Nobody care though if Edward Norton throw it. Just make us yawn. It has villain who have own motivation although by end of film writers give up, probably drunk on bathtub liquor. End with big fight which taught me new thing. Apparent a big chain is more effective than all firepower of US army. Maybe this is why US army not good fighting wars. Other countries armed with chains and planks of wood with nails in while they only have tanks and cannons. Poor them. So we have lots of action scene and we have CGI monster sock creature. We have explode, villain who starts caring what he does but then just decide to be another monster for some reason. Is sloppy work but basically not terrible. Better than Thor. Not good as Iron man but villain far better than Captain American. Good enough if you don't take your brain with you to cinema.

I was a little skeptical about Edward Norton, but he made a good Bruce Banner) but because it was like watching the pages of comic book come alive, like watching all those animated shows of HULK. While the Ang Lee version was a more intellectual and emotional approach to the story, this movie is simple and true to the characters. The beauty and beast love story, which according to me is the essence of the incredible tale, is more prominent in this movie. Sure there are lot of differences from the original story by Stan Lee, but it hardly bothered me as I watched the big green hero smash up all in his path and clash with the mighty Abomination.

915,14 June 2008,IMDb_advocate,8," Overall very entertaining but CGI can still be improved upon...
","I must agree with some of the positive comments as well as some of the not-so-positive ones. First off I want to say that I'm a huge Hulk fan and was really hopeful that I'd be blown away by this movie. In some aspects, I was. In others, not so much. Props go to the casting director(with two small exceptions), Leterrier's trademark fast-paced direction, his homage paid to the TV series and the somewhat improved CGI. William Norton is perfectly cast for this role. It showed that he researched and really knew the character he was portraying. William Hurt I thought at first would not do as good a job playing Ross as Sam Elliott did but I was completely wrong in that prediction. He was wonderful! Great pacing in this movie. Never a dull moment. True Leterrier style movie-making! The scenes shot in Brazil were breathtaking and my favorite portion of the movie. The disappointments? While Norton resembled Banner better in all aspects than Eric Bana, Liv Tyler pales in comparison to Jennifer Connelly. There never seemed to be much range of emotion from her. Just this constant look of shock/astonishment. Though nice to look at, never does she convince me she has the intellect, confidence or wherewithal a brilliant scientist would exude. She comes off like a little girl in awe of everything happening around her. I'm probably exaggerating here but that is all I can honestly remember about her performance. The other casting gaffe in my opinion was Tim Roth. Not because of his acting ability (he was excellent in that regard) but, instead, because his diminutive stature. As at least one previous poster stated, Roth looks absolutely puny beside Hurt plus, as evidenced in the scenes with his shirt off, his physical conditioning doesn't resemble what I would picture an elite soldier possessing. And what's up with the facial hair? Is that even allowed in the military? Those were the two slight casting flubs in my opinion but the bigger problem I had with the movie was the erratic quality of the CGI. I'm not going to totally bash it like some have because it was excellent at times, like during the closeups. The ""cave"" scene demonstrated the highs and lows perfectly. Overall I thought that scene fared poorly on the CGI scale but, for a few short seconds, when the camera got especially close to Hulk it looked quite realistic! The Abomination, BTW, looked consistently fantastic and was truly fearsome looking! While Hulk's anatomy was much improved over the 2003 version, I'm not sure Rhythm & Hues upped the illusion of realism that much. Finally, I thought the final scene wasn't as dramatic as it should have been. I'm not saying it was lame by any stretch of the imagination but it definitely could have been improved upon. I didn't see what caused Hulk to get the upper hand on the Abomination after getting his butt kicked thoroughly up until then. Also, after ""brilliant"" Betty stopped Hulk from justifiably killing the Abomination, how are we to conceive that the military could contain him once he revives? In the comics, even though he always finds a way back into the storyline, we're at least led to believe the Abomination is killed by Hulk. I guess there's always a possibility that's all planned out in the sequel. Maybe the Abomination pairing up with the Leader, possibly leading to Iron Man coming to Hulk's aid? Sounds interesting...",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

This film Bruce Banners' antagonist works for me with General Ross liked the character and his firm military always getting in the way. The Hulks' antagonist is for me where this film fell apart a younger version of Ross out for power just didn't live up for me. I would love to see Betty Ross make a comeback in the MCU, although that may never happen it was nice to see General Ross make it back to drive a knife through Tony and Capt in Civil war! Obviously there is still loads they could do with Ross's character and with Talbot showing up in Agents of Shield another Hulk film would be great to have Ross, Betty, Talbot, and Banner all in the mix. Likely we will just have to love the Hulk and forget about the Bruce Banner character, but at the end of the day MORE HULK is never a bad thing.

","When I first saw that this movie was coming out to theaters...I was a little disappointed. My first reaction was ""oh great. another unneeded remake. most likely just to make a quick buck"". I will also add that I was surprised and relieved after i viewed this film because it was not at all what I had expected at first. and come on Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth and William Hurt all together...that's the sign of great potential to be a good film. Overall, it was a ""decent"" (don't take that word for any more than I'm trying to use it as) film that at least kept me awake and maybe a little interested. it definitely had its downfalls (for example: who goes to watch a movie called ""The Incredible Hulk"" to watch a bunch of people discuss what they should do?....no! they come to watch Hulk Smash!!!! So, my suggestion is that they should have shown more Hulk than just the characters running from each other). Anyways, I will compare this film to the original because I didn't mind the original...even though it seems everyone else did. I thought it wasn't as bad as everyone said, but that's not the important issue. I believe this movie and the original are about the same, so if you hated the original I wouldn't give this a try, but if you loved the original then don't expect any differences but do expect coming out with a good feeling. So, even though I didn't come out that disappointed there were still some pretty major flaws that brought it down on its knees. It's just the same old superhero concept; The main character has superhuman abilities, has to learn to control them and use them for good, the conflict arises as another equally powerful villain, and thus ending in a great battle between good vs. evil and, of course, good comes out victorious. 6/10 for enjoyment reasons only....oh and P.S. ***spoilers (not bad ones though) spoilers*** Robert Downey Jr. makes a surprise appearance at the end as Mr. Tony Stark (Iron Man) in which he discusses with one of the main characters that he and his group are thinking about making a team...most likely hinting that there will be a movie with all the superheroes and villains to make one colossal movie (something along the lines of The Avengers)...that got me excited.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

The main actress is absolute much better than the previous one as well. I don't know much about the acting stuff, but at least, when i watched Hulk 2, i was sorta convinced by the love story between two main characters and that i can hardly get from Hulk 1. I think both two actresses were given roughly the same important roles and scenes in the movies, but the first one is just blank and empty, the character itself is dull which is the script writer's fault. All i can think of her is her looking and screaming?(perhaps. no much impression for sure.) the second one is much more vivid and they added in some scenes (some very detail things)to show us their love to each other which is quite necessary and sweet. we wouldn't just suddenly believe they love each other so much when each time we see only the main actress could stop the Hulk when Hulk lost control(Hulk one). i mean, thats just so childish to me.

935,13 July 2008,garantiefall,6," 114 Minutes Without Incident
","Now, I'm a little bit curious. Am I the only one who thinks this script was incredibly lame? Apparently so, for no one else here seems to disagree on any level with it. Let me take this occasion to lay out some of my concerns for you: First of all, they started the thing with a huge montage, in order to get done most of the exposition they must have been afraid would take them half of the movie otherwise. Fine, the advent of The Hulk was displayed thoroughly in 2003's ""Hulk"", but still. Though I really don't know much about The Hulk, I'm rather confident I could have taken these revelations in a more subtle way.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008
936,17 April 2016,NeverEndr,6," Quickly Descends into Mindless Summer Movie Madness
","This movie begins pretty strongly but quickly descends into mindless summer movie madness. Dr. Banner (played by Edward Norton) is hiding out in Brazil, in the beginning, being taught breathing exercises to control his anger which is actually pretty interesting. The opening Hulk scene is also really memorable by delivering the Hulk in more of a monstrous fashion rather than some of the more traditional action sequences later in the film. As the movie goes on, however, it seems to dumb itself down more and more. We are given a damsel-in-distress performance by Liv Tyler as Banner's lost love...who is introduced as being involved with another man which doesn't seem to do anything but serve as a plot point. We are given the stereotypical ""bad military man"" chasing Banner with an unmemorable performance from Hurt. Worst of all, we are given an inexplicably suicidal merc who wants to confront the monstrous Hulk for nothing more than a seeming adrenaline rush. This reaches absurdity when, at one point in the film, this elite military veteran becomes so brazen as to confront the Hulk, weaponless (he literally throws his rifle away), goading him on. Even with all of the bad aspects, the movie does do a good job of remaining fun. The Hulk scenes really deliver exactly what you would want from a Hulk movie. Norton also does a decent job of playing Dr. Banner. Even Tyler's performance works some scenes were being the damsel in distress really fits (such as a cave scene during a storm midway through the film). Overall, this is a movie that is enjoyable for fans of comic book films or the Hulk, but doesn't really deliver enough to be memorable for a more neutral movie goer.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008
937,29 August 2021,lilydang016,5," A boring mess
","Given this supposed to be a stand-alone origin movie of the Hulk, I'm very disappointed to not have seen the backstory of who and how Bruce Banner was, and what his relationship with Betty was like before he turned into the Hulk. This made the story not captivating enough, and I didn't feel invested in the characters. The relationship between Bruce and his love interest was also not convincing at all because of this.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

941,7 December 2019,deborahmylo,1," 2003 Hulk is more incredible than this rubbish
","A new generation of low attention span nerds hated Hulk 2003 because alongside the action, the film had a deep and evolving emotional and philosophical outlook on the world of the Hulk, and all these elitist nerds wanted was a brainless smash a thon, which they readily get in this Hulk, without any depth or interesting characters to speak of - you get what you ask for, just a bunch of silly fight scenes without much else. The emotional connection is lost, and Edward Norton's Hulk looks neither impressive or anything like his comic origins, with the CGI noticeably less impressive than the 2003 monster that was both terrifying, immensely strong, and had an authentic emotional bond to the story. This just one action scene after another, glued together by flimsy plot, that comes across as a hindrance in the film's mission to satiate the juvenile, low attention span nerds who complained. Poor film, not even worthy of 1/10.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

943,12 August 2020,adamrugg,8," A really fun underrated part of the MCU
","There is something about this film, something that is so fun and easy to watch. It grips you and it's a great Hulk story but more importantly a great Bruce Banner story. For a film about a huge green monster it is an incredibly human film. You can tell from the start of the film that Bruce hates the Hulk, he hates being the Hulk. It is clear from when you see him take control of his breathing, you see him try meditate. As a viewer you know he's not a bad guy but he is a man who struggles. This struggle is the Hulk. It ruins his life. He must move country, he can't see the person he loves, he can't even do the deed with that girl. The two villains of the film General Ross and The Abomination. Two really fun and great villains. The Abomination is everything Bruce works not to be, a monster. So that final battle is so great. Two massive powerhouses both seen as the villain to the public going at it. Plus it's one of the best fights in the MCU. It's almost been 12 years since this came out. But I still find myself constantly going back to it. It's not perfect, it is a bit cringe and doesn't have the best animation that we are now accustomed to. But it's not bad at all. I don't find a problem with it and if you are looking for a great Hulk film(Probably the only one we'll get in the MCU) this is it! Edward Norton personifies the man behind the monster and I find it a real shame is journey as the Hulk stopped when it did. Rewatch this film! Give it a shot, don't go into it looking to rip it apart. Enjoy it for what it is and you'll be pleased.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008

","I honestly didn't know how much I was going to enjoy the film. Over the years, I've felt myself drifting from superhero entertainment due to the saturation of them these days (especially in the MCU). But this is definitely a classic that withstands the test of time for me. I remember being a big fan of the Hulk as a kid (costume and toys). And this film brought back the same childhood love I have for the character. It was a lot of fun with the fight scenes. It was also gripping with Banner's personal struggles with taming the beast within him and trying to rekindle his love with his ex-girlfriend and former coworker.",/review/rw6681215/?ref_=tt_urv,The_Incredible_Hulk_(2008
