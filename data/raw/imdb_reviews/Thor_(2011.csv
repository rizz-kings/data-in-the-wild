1,3 June 2011,rparham,8," Thor proves a strong contender
","In the pantheon of Marvel Superheroes, from my vantage point, Thor is a second-tier player. Even amongst non-obsessive comic aficionados, such as myself, Thor doesn't quite have the readership draw or the common familiarity in the public that heroes such as Spider-Man, Batman, Superman, etc., have. However, that doesn't mean that Marvel Studios, the filmmaking wing of the company, feel inclined to give the filmic adaptation of Thor short shrift. The cinematic entry for this character, titled simply Thor, is among the better of the Marvel adaptations of recent years, mixing a good sense of fun, strong acting, and some Shakespearian level drama that makes for an especially entertaining time at the movies.",/review/rw2429213/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_(2011

",Thor was much much better than I expected. I didn't know if they could pull of the balance between the Norse mythology stuff and the real world Marvel Universe. I should've known better because Marvel knows their characters and knows what we want to see. Spider-Man set a new standard for the superhero film genre back in the day. Iron Man upped the ante. Thor takes the ball and runs with it and places that bar even higher. I look forward to seeing it again and know it will do well enough to be worthy of a sequel because word of mouth is going to be great. Trust me when I say Thor REALLY IS as good as Iron Man and is most worthy to be called one of the greatest adaptations ever.,/review/rw2429213/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_(2011

To my surprise, this film turned out to be one of my favourite comic book films ever. The story's interesting without being overly convoluted, starting in an unlikely place as we meet astrophysicist, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), who works alongside scientists, Darcy (Kat Dennings) and Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård), and she makes a memorable first impression as she accidentally hits Thor (Chris Hemsworth) with her car (on more than one occasion). He's been cast out of Asgard for going against the wishes of his father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), and picking fights with the Frost Giants. Meanwhile, his devious brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is plotting against him (which Odin *really* should've seen coming, as having two sons and telling them that only 'one' can be King never ends well).",/review/rw2429213/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_(2011

","¨Whoever wields this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.¨ With Thor, summer movies have officially started in Hollywood. It's not one of my favorite seasons of the year for films, but if the rest of the movies can live up to what Kenneth Branagh has accomplished with Thor it will be an exciting and entertaining season at the movies. I wasn't a huge fan of Thor before this movie came out, I wasn't even expecting too much out of it, but I decided to go see it because he's still one of The Avengers and I couldn't miss out on all the propaganda that began with Iron Man. With each one of these films my expectations for The Avengers is rapidly building, and even Thor managed to win me over to his side. The first thing I can say about the movie is that it was entertaining enough for me to want to go see it twice in two days. The story, the visuals, the strong performance from two relatively unknown actors like Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston are all factors that contribute to making this movie successful. Include Natalie Portman and Anthony Hopkins into the mix and you have an even better film. The directing had a lot to do with it as well because Kenneth Branagh is a serious and dedicated director; he has proved it time after time with his adaptations of Shakespearean plays. He was dedicated with this project as well; adapted this Marvel comic superhero and prepared him for the big screen. Like most every Marvel character, they are very well developed and the film is no exception remaining true to the comic.",/review/rw2429213/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_(2011
18,29 April 2011,moviexclusive,9," A thrilling blend of action and drama- with some comedy thrown in for good measure- Marvel's latest superhero addition is perfect summer entertainment
","The Norse god Thor is admittedly one of Marvel's second-league  superheroes, but just like Iron Man, both are inevitable steps in  Marvel's continuing march towards arguably the most highly anticipated  comic book adaptation in movie history next year- ""The Avengers"". Yet,  if there's anything to learn from the ""Iron Man"" experience, it's that  it's entirely possible to turn a B-league superhero into an A-grade  feature film with just the right star and the right director.   And kudos to the Marvel team for doing it once again with ""Thor"", a  thoroughly entertaining blockbuster of a film that succeeds thanks to  the unlikely choices of Kenneth Branagh as director and Chris Hemsworth  as the star of the titular character. Kenneth is the English director  best known as cinema's foremost exponent of the Bard, while Chris is  the Australian actor probably only known as the father to James T. Kirk  in last year's ""Star Trek"". Both are equally unlikely choices to  headline this US$150mil tentpole, though Marvel's gamble has paid off  handsomely.   Unlike Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, or for that matter the upcoming  Captain America who were products of science, Thor was the hammer-  wielding alien-god who was always going to be a tricky proposition  adapting for the big screen. After all, the combination of Norse  mythology and science fiction could easily have degenerated into  kitschy camp, so it's a good thing that Kenneth knows when to get  serious and when to have fun. He films the scenes of Thor in his  homeland Asgard with the utmost gravitas, while leaving the humour for  his brief fish- out-of-water stint on Earth.  Indeed, Kenneth handles the power feuds and sibling rivalry with the  same intensity as he would a Shakespearian production, and brings a  deeply human perspective to his godly characters. In particular, the  tussle between father and sons is emotionally charged- whether Odin's  heartbreak at banishing his son Thor, whom he was about to coronate as  king, out of the kingdom for arrogantly and impetuously reigniting a  war with an ancient enemy; or Loki's confrontation with Odin about his  true origins- and therefore electrifying to watch.   To add weight to the proceedings at Asgard, Kenneth brings in two  excellent character actors alongside Chris- Anthony Hopkins and Tom  Hiddleston. Anthony's patriarchal role isn't new for the actor, but he  delivers a restrained yet powerful and dignified performance as Thor's  father Odin. Tom, on the other hand, is deliciously snarky playing the  sibling jealous of Thor's impending ascension to the throne, and the  British actor gives a surprisingly intimate and affecting villainous  turn that brings unexpected depth to his character.   In contrast to the godly solemnity, Kenneth brings some welcome Earthly  humour to Thor's subsequent banishment. The trio of scriptwriters  Ashley Edward Miller, Zack Stentz and Don Payne (working from an  effective origin story by J. Michael Straczynski and Mark Protosevich)  reserve the movie's wittiest lines for Thor's interplay with three  mortal beings- astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), her  gal-pal/assistant Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) and Jane's mentor, Dr.  Erik Sevig (Stellan Skarsgard), while Kenneth directs Thor's awkward  adjustment to life on Earth (an absolutely hilarious scene has Thor  storming into a pet store and asking for a horse to go about his  mission to find his mysterious magical hammer Mjolnir) with just the  right amount of infectious fun.  There's also an intercelestial romance thrown in for good measure, as  Thor and Jane develop a growing attraction for each other. But more  than just obligatory, the love between god and human becomes a lesson  in humility and self-sacrifice for the fallen Thor to pave his  restoration back to glory. Though thinly written, Portman makes the  best out of her role, and it is to her credit that Jane becomes an  engaging and believable character that the audience roots for. Portman  also shares a warm chemistry with Chris, which brings poignancy to  their relationship as well as Thor's subsequent transformation.  Thor's time on Earth is also used to forge the necessary narrative  links with ""The Avengers"", in the form of Clark Gregg's S.H.I.E.L.D.  agent Coulson, an unbilled cameo by Jeremy Renner as the archer  Hawkeye, and Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury appearance right at the end  of the credits. Fans of the Thor universe from the comic books will  also delight in the awe-inspiring presence of Heimdall (Idris Elba), as  well as Thor's entourage of Asgard warrior pals Sif (Jaimie Alexander),  Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Fandral (Josh Dallas), and Hogun (Tadanobu  Asano).   These pals also add colour to the action sequences, which Kenneth  choreographs with surprising aplomb. He stages a thunderous battle very  early on as Thor leads an attack against the Frost Giants on the planet  of Jotunheim with every bit of might and muscle one would expect from a  clash of godly beings. There are at least two other money sequences-  Thor's duel with a hulking piece of metal known as the Destroyer (which  Coulson first tongue-in-cheek mistakes to be one of Stark's equipment)  in a small New Mexico town; and the thrilling climactic battle between  Thor and Loki back on Asgard.   But the star that holds it all together is really Chris Hemsworth, his  performance a well-calibrated blend of brawn and heart that will put  sceptics to rest. His physicality is apparent right from the start, but  Chris gradually reveals a winning charm and a heartfelt sincerity that  enables his audience to relate with his character's inner struggles. It  is a breakout star-making turn, which shows Chris adept at action,  comedy and even romance.   And certainly, it is to Kenneth Branagh's credit that these disparate  elements can belong so comfortably in a movie that also combines  mythology and science fiction. True to its origins, ""Thor"" is nothing  less than superhero entertainment, and a definitive A-list one -despite  the initial regard of its source character- that kicks off this summer  with a bang, boom and rumble.",/review/rw2429213/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_(2011

","I had very low expectations for this movie when my daughter dragged me to the 12:01am showing of ""Thor"" on opening night here in the States. After all, I've never read the comic and there didn't seem to be all that much publicity concerning this film--and I just thought it would be one of Marvel's lesser films. However, when the film began I was absolutely blown away. It had to be the most beautiful and mind-blowing superhero film ever--with gorgeous visuals of other worlds that even sci-fi films haven't come close to matching. And, combined with nice 3-D effects and an exceptional score, you just turn off your brain and absorb it all--like some sort of mind-altering drug!

","Though I'm old and did read some comics in my time, Thor was never one of them. I do teach some Norse mythology, though, so that aspect interested me. There was an odd steampunk approach to the mythology, which was OK, I suppose. I really didn't expect this movie to be War and Peace, and I was certainly right on the money with that. It went for the snarky Iron Man approach more than I thought it would. It's hard to pull off without veteran snarkmeister Robert Downey, Jr., though. Chris Hemsworth is impossibly charming and good- looking in the title role, and does pretty well, considering some of the lines he had to say. Anthony Hopkins is a safe choice for his patented Older Mentor/Authority Figure performance (enjoy that check, Anthony), and Tom Hiddleston is somewhat intriguing as Loki. Stellan Skarsgard is completely wasted in a role that could have been phoned in. But you know who really stinks up the joint? Natalie Portman. It was DAMN hard to believe she was an astrophysicist, but it was even harder to believe that THOR (god of thunder, possessor of unspeakable power) would find her even remotely interesting. All she does is whine. The alleged falling in love is quite unbelievable, BTW. Yeesh. I hope the inevitable sequel loses her character.",/review/rw2429213/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_(2011

Australian Chris Hemsworth graced the red carpet in all his native glory, talking up the film and his future entity in The Avengers. He was joined by Shakespeare aficionado Director Kenneth Brangh and co stars Jamie Alexander & Tom Hiddleston who plays crowd favourite Loki. Thor is a good movie, plenty of action, a lovely heroine (Natalie Portman) and some interesting sidekicks.

Other than that, I thought this movie was OK with the beginning being the best part and I didn't care for the ending. The first 45 minutes was very entertaining with some good special effects. Basically the first part is about Thor's people and their conflict with the frost giants. The frost giants invade and Thor with his other brother, Loki, and friends go to the frost giant land looking to start a war. We see some of the cool powers Thor has with his hammer. But the King is furious and banishes Thor to earth minus his powers and that's when the movie starts to get duller. He meets scientist, Natalie Portman, whom of course he falls for. I thought there should have been funnier scenes between Thor and regular people. He gets in trouble with the Feds, but just gets released, then the ending is this giant robot that is some how controlled by Loki from the other planet.

An extremely promising setup to Joss Whedon's The Avengers, which is slated for release in the summer of 2012, Thor is without any doubt the best film Marvel Studios has produced in recent years, even better than the Iron Man (2008, 2010) series, I'd reckon.

","Okay, so Thor is pretty darn decent. Phew. Without revealing anything regarding the plot, I'll just say that I enjoyed this film quite a lot, and would rate it above both Iron Man films, but not by too much. (If you hated them maybe just stay away from Marvel movies in general?) Very good in all areas, without achieving greatness in any sums up this movie nicely I think. Beautiful costumes and set design, solid acting all around, and much better action than recent movies have offered up. The world of Asgard has been handled wonderfully, looking absolutely gorgeous, and with all of its denizens very well spoken without their dialogue ever being as obtuse or clunky as Thor's 'Ye Olde' English has been known to be in the past. Special mention to Idris Elba for being friggin' awesome. I'm a pretty big Marvel fan, but not knowing what Mjolnir is won't harm your enjoyment of Thor to any great degree I don't think. Also, side note, I personally dislike 3D with a great, burning passion (thank you Clash of the Titans), but it is relatively well done here, never distracting from the film. I would still recommend seeing it in 2D if you can though, as it is quite dark in parts. Several parts. Bring on the Avengers!",/review/rw2429213/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_(2011

","I have to admit, i had low expectations for this adaptation. Hulk yeah sure, Iron man, why not, Captain America, its set in the real word of course it'll work. But THOR? A wildly fantastical tale of Norse Gods and Rainbow bridges and nicknamed hammers ?? Surely not! Ill stop with the bashing; this film is astonishing. The oddest thing has happened here. Coupling notoriously artsy director Kenneth Branagh with one of Marvels most theatrical characters was a stroke of genius. At the beginning of the film, we are quickly introduced to Jane Foster, her whimsical offsider and an older gentleman. Storm chasers aren't normally this clever you might think to yourself during this opening scene, but alas, they are revealed to actually be physicists after a few minutes. An incredible storm arrives and THOR HAS LANDED: or so you would think. Mere moments after being introduced to our title character we are thrust on an astrological journey to Asgard, land of gods. Here we are introduced to Odin, the all father and his 2 young boys; Loki and Thor. Odin recites stories of an ancient war in which a planet load of frost giants planned to destroy the realm of Midgard (earth) before Odin and his merry men stepped in to save humanity. It is during this scene we are first shown Thor's arrogance and thirst for war. Skip ahead a few years and THOR has become Asgard's mightiest warrior, just as Odin had foretold. A celebration is occurring, Thor is about to be crowned as king of Asgard, but alas... this glorious day is interrupted by none other than said FrostGiants attempting to steal a stolen heirloom from Asgard's weapons locker.. The story rapidly gains traction from here. Thor marches into the Frost Giants planet (against his fathers will) in all his Aussie glory, kicking ass and taking names. He and his friends become swiftly over powered and Odin is left no choice but to step in. An argument erupts in which Odin tells Thor of his assholness and douchebaggery and that he is no longer worthy of his giant hammer Mjolnir or his god of Thunder status. Cast down to Earth the audience is reunited with the opening scene and we are officially filled in. A bevy of comedic scenes follow in which Chris hemsworth's THOR is tranquillised and run over multiple times. The film transitions backwards and forwards between our world and that of Asgard so as to keep us informed on going ons. Odin goes into a coma and Thor's mischievous bro Loki starts to come into his own. A marvellous story unfolds filled with action, humour, heartache and a whole heap of awesome!! Branagh's eye for curious shots is on full show here and works fabulously in creating a beautifully surreal Asgard. The films close is a little rushed but is also very heartfelt and strong. Leaving plenty of room for more character development, THOR is as good as if not better than every comic film to date, the characters were superbly cast and played and the story follows as close as it can to the source material as it can without being too over the top. Spectacularly fun movie, worthy of the Marvel name tag and certainly a sequel. 10 out of 10 for performance and entertainment....",/review/rw2429213/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_(2011

","Although having originally balked at director Kenneth Branagh for casting Chris Hemsworth in the lead of this film, i have to say i was presently pleased with the job he did in this. Now as you will see in this version Chris Hemsworth is ribbed and cut however I was hoping he would've used a wrestler such as the likes of Paul (Triple H) Levesque he's way more massive in the body building sense then Hemsworth is. Im sure however that Hemsworth is a better actor. Needless to say the film rocked and turned out to be one of the better comic book adaptations i have seen to date. Branagh carefully handpicked his cast in this with the end product proving this immensely. After being cast out of his mystical city of Asgard by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) Thor is sent to earth with his famed hammer. He is befriended by scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and with her team they follow Thor as he treks to find his hammer. Upon finding the mystical and powerful weapon he cannot seem to pull it from its place embedded in earth. This leads him and his friendly band of scientists to find out as to why he has come to earth and deemed powerless. It takes a powerful Asgardian foe that comes down to earth to destroy Thor and with malicious intent to do more harm then good to earth's mortal citizens, to give Thor what he needs to conquer and rejoin his father as a King in Asgard! Kenneth Branagh in his first comic book super hero genre type film did a superb job in retelling what is one of my favourite heroes that the great Stan Lee crafted in his comic book series.

But I'm a fan of Anthony Hopkins, who here has fun as the top god Odin, and of Natalie Portman, who here is rather wasted after her terrific performance in ""Black Swan"".

","A solid enough popcorn muncher that never even hints at reaching a deeper level. Chris Hemsworth does what he sets out to, making waves with his appearance if not his acting, while Natalie Portman tries in vain to turn her uncertain supporting role into something more significant. It's really two films under one heading, as the developments in Thor's celestial homeworld of Asgard provide gorgeous vistas but no meat, and the fish-out-of-water character moments of the god of thunder fallen to Earth deliver good-natured, if shallow, fun. With a few listless fight scenes thrown in to stir the waters, Thor never runs the risk of growing stagnant but also doesn't give its audience much to think about. It's all spelled out with no regard for subtlety, hammered into the pre-planned groundwork for Marvel's upcoming Avengers mega- pic with the kind of blunt nuance one might expect from a character known primarily for his rash, impatient brawn.

","Thor is an excitement-filled action adventure that competently puts the God of Thunder on the pedestal with flashy visual scope serving a warm welcome for another Marvel comics entry. Taking the director's chair is Kenneth Branaugh who takes the spirit of the titular hero and slaps it on screen with endearing charisma, and the results shine, though not in a way that breaths game-changer. As opposed to many heroes of the Avengers team, Thor is not your typical modern day hero. This hammer-wielding god combines average superhero elements and clashes them with the fantasy-esque world that bears reminiscence to Greek mythology. He is an inhabitant of a mystical world of unnatural wonders outside of Earth, and serves as the center of the story that draws small parallels to William Shakespeare's 'Hamlet'. In some context, it is an superhero origin story that almost falls in the category of an epic, though perhaps that classification would be rooting too deep. This film is takes us in the distant world of Asgard, ruled by the mighty king Odin (played by Anthony Hopkins). Under his wing are his two sons Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (played by Tom Hiddleston). As Odin prepares to crown the former as king, the realm becomes threatened by evil Frost Giants. Determined to protect his home, Thor goes against his father's orders and sets out to find against the evildoers. When his actions heightens a war between Asgard and the giants, Odin strips Thor of his powers and exiles him to Earth where he is forced to enlist the help of scientists Eric Slevig (played by Stellan Skarsgard) and Jane Foster (played by Natalie Portman) and their intern Darcy Lewis (played by Kat Denning) to help regain his powers.

It may be an atypical Branagh film as it was really his first truly mainstream one since ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" in 1994 but his direction is typically brilliant in both the quieter character moments and the hugely impressive action sequences, which were a bit of a departure for him.

","Although the newest addition to the Marvel Comics' cinematic super hero pantheon boasts polished production values and a charismatic cast, ""Hamlet"" director Kenneth Branagh's ""Thor"" qualifies as business as usual. This preposterous, larger-than-life, 115-minute, PG-13 rated opus shifts scenes between contemporary New Mexico and the fabled realm of Asgard where Norse royalty reside in opulent splendor. ""Agent Cody Banks"" scenarists Ashley Edward Miller & Zack Stentz along with ""Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" scribe Don Payne gave ""Thor"" their best shot based on a story by ""Ninja Assassin"" scenarist J. Michael Straczynski and ""Poseidon"" writer Mark Protosevich. Despite those best efforts, ""Thor"" amounts to a standard-issue 'origins' epic about Odin's arrogant offspring. No surprises lurk in this predictable, but sometimes amusing epic about the hammer wielding Norse champion. Basically, ""Thor"" boils down to a boy-gets-hammer, boy-loses-hammer, and boy-gets-hammer back adventure. During this lukewarm lark, our hero acquaints himself with the meaning of humility after his stern father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) has banished him from his own celestial kingdom. Handsome Aussie stud Chris Hemsworth, cast as Captain Kirk's father in the ""Star Trek"" reboot, provides the appropriate brawn and blond hair as the eponymous hero afflicted with anger management issues. Mind you, the real Thor of lore possessed red hair and a red beard. Meantime, Academy Award winning actress Natalie Portman, Kat Dennings, and Stellan Skarsgård enliven the Earth scenes, while Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins lords it over the Asgard scenes as the one-eyed Odin.

","Kenneth Branagh's ""Thor"" is one of the best movies that MARVEL comics has ever made along with he other franchises that they have done and practically strikes the right chords every time, and is directed by a man who at the time was very inexperienced with making these types of movies. The movie stars Chris Hemsworth who is perfectly cast as Thor (who also happens to be my second favorite hero in the MARVEL universe) who is the Norse god of thunder, and lives in a realm known as Asgard. Thor is also a man who believes in doing the right thing but sometimes he also lets his morals get to his head a little too often. Thor's father is a god the vikings would pray to named Odin (Anthony Hopkins) who is married to Frigga (Rene Russo), and they only have another child who is very similar to Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus in ""Gladiator"" (2000) and is obsessed with ruling Asgard, who happens to be Thor's brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) who is the god of mischief. Later as the film progresses we see Thor get exiled from Asgard for talking disrespectfully to his father and he sees himself on earth and then goes on a rampage and is then taken in by SHIELD agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) for questioning. After the interrogation is over he meets a young woman named Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), who is with her family just so that they can get to know who Thor is, and during that time his personality changes from being less arrogant to being a lot more caring towards humans who he previously felt were inferior to him. The visual effects in this movie were breathtaking to see and not only is Hemsworth perfectly cast but Hopkins is as well and deliver fine performances, along with Portman, Russo, and Hiddleston, but as well as Idris Elba as Heimdall, and Stellan Skarsgard as a teacher. But however even though the movie is very good the only thing that prevents it from being great is a routinely frequent problem with MARVEL movies is that some times they really don't get the costumes right which is the case with Thor's costume even though they nailed most of it they just forgot his winged helmet even though this isn't really a major problem for me. Even though this isn't a perfect superhero movie it is one of the best movies that MARVEL and their creator Stan Lee have ever come up with and is one of the best superhero movies of 2011 and of this decade.",/review/rw2429213/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_(2011

112,13 July 2022,TheHonestCritic,10," This is one of my top five favorite Marvel films. How does it hold up today? Check out my review below!
","""Thor"" (2011), up until the first announcement for this movie, I had no idea that the comic book superhero Thor existed. So, when I went to go see this film in the theater, I had literally no idea what to expect. In some cases, that can make the first viewing experience even more enjoyable. That's the case for ""Thor""! When I went to see this movie, I was hooked right from the beginning to end. Since I enjoyed it so much in the theater, I thought it was just a fluke and that my excitement for it would soon fade away. Nope, when I eventually bought it on DVD and watched it a second time, I loved it just as much, if not more than I did the first time I saw it. ""Thor"" has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and of course a perfect soundtrack to tie it all together. The plot is, a well-meaning but arrogant god named Thor is banished from his realm, Asgard, by his father, Odin, and then sent to live on Earth to grow up. At first I thought, ""oh, here we go, it's just going to be yet another fish-out-of-water scenario."" Now that being said, one of the most commonly used attributes in the world of cinema is easily the best and funniest part of this film. Watching Thor, a god try to adjust to human life in our world is hilarious and a lot of fun to watch. Plus, there's an intertwining storyline where his brother Loki is trying to become King of Asgard, like him taking place, which makes the whole plot all the more intriguing. I won't go into any extra details about the storyline. But, let me assure you, it's a story you'll remember for the rest of your life. It's a cohesive balance of action, comedy and it also has a lot of great morals thrown in as well, that give it that much more heart and emotion to the plot. As for the acting, it's phenomenal from the whole entire cast. They all do fantastic in this movie! But, the shining stars here, in my opinion, are Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Tom Hiddleston as the villainous Loki and Anthony Hopkins as Odin. They really make this film, and the three of them give the whole cast such a strong chemistry! Had someone else been cast as either of the characters, then it may not have worked. Every single actor and actress nail their roles and fire on all cylinders! All of the sets/locations are perfect and give this film an amazing atmosphere. You can't go wrong with filming in New Mexico! But, my personal favorite set is Asgard. That whole location is stunning, and exciting to look at on the screen! As for the special effects, they are all very well-done and still hold up to this day. Which is no surprise, since it came out in 2011! Finally, the soundtrack composed by Patrick Doyle is exceptional. His film score sets the perfect tone for the storyline and helps bring the movie to life. My personal favorite song in the soundtrack, and one of the best sequences in the film is the end credits. Those end credits accompanied by that big score, simply make it exhilarating. It's easily one of my top ten favorite end credit sequences of all-time. Props to you, Patrick Doyle! ""Thor"" is nothing but perfection in the genre of superhero movies. I could watch it over and over and not get tired of it! Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Thor"" yet, what are you waiting for? Go check it out today! It's such a shame that the ""Thor"" sequels are trash and don't hold a candle to this one. Yet, for some reason, people consider ""Thor"" to be one of the weakest films in the saga. Why? Are you really that selfish?

It is colorful, full of great CGI(3D really gets it job done well this time), deprived of unnecessary weight on plot(it is rather simple, yet not stupid), and it doesn't overstay its welcome, running just below 2hrs mark(but stay for an extra scene after the credits). Also it features very good performances all around. I was really impressed by newcomer Chris Hemsworth, who played lead role. It was spot on choice to go with him, instead of some more famous face, since he's done his job almost impeccably in a clearly star making role. Other players were very solid also, with beautiful Natalie Portman as main female character, Sir Hopkins in surprisingly long supporting role, and other fine actors(like Ray Stevenson, who was so disguised I only recognized him after the movie). I must say that it is best movie of it's kind since first Iron Man, and definitely in top group of comic book adaptations.

Thor's relationship with Jane and the other human characters is so forced and simplistic, all characters are one-dimensional and add no value to the movie. It does not look like their affection grew through the experiences they shared together; they just spend a night under the stars to realize they are soulmates. I guess the whole thing is supposed to be about Thor's growth as a character, but again there is no development whatsoever: the arrogant and reckless kid suddenly changes into a big-hearted superhero, just because the story requires him to.

","after weeks of seeing trailers for this on TV, I finally got to see this last night at my local cinema. I love superhero movies, and this movie didn't let me down at all. I was Thor-oughly entertained from start to finish. this was different to other movies in the genre, it had a bit of everything,sci-fi, fantasy, action, comedy, drama. The acting was great, Chis hemsworth as Thor was perfect. he has a certain prescence on screen and oozes charisma.looked the part too, beefing up well for the role.For an Australian, he really nailed the medieval English accent required. he definitely has a future in film, i can see him playing a jason bourne type character in the future. Other top actors in the film played their parts well too. most notable Anthony Hopkins as Thors father Odin and Tom Hiddleston as Thors brother Loki. Natalie Portman was fine as scientist love interest Jane Foster, but all she had to do really was say her lines and look good, which she did great. the 3d effects in this movie also added to the entertainment. I thaught the effects were as good as avatar in places. certainly better than any other 3d film other than avatar. didn't take away from the action at all like in films such as Clash of the Titans, where the effects became blurry at times. the scenes in thors home realm Asdgard were especially good in 3d. I would definitely recommend seeing this in 3d if you have a choice.To sum up, fantastic summer superhero blockbuster that doesn't fail to entertain, had the potential to be really bad but wasn't at all. has all the elements that make a great summer blockbuster, superhero movie, go see it !!",/review/rw2429213/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_(2011

Since they were young the king taught his sons that they must never start a war but only retaliate if truly necessary. His sons are Thor (Chris Hemsworth), an arrogant hammer-wielding warrior and the jealous Loki (Tom Hiddleston). To respond to a sneak attack on the kingdom by the Frost Giants, Thor takes it upon himself to lead a group of his friends to punish the beasts. After barely surviving a deadly battle and having one of his men wounded, Thor is interrogated by Odin and banished for disobeying his father's order for peace. He is stripped of his powers and both he and his magical hammer are blasted out of the magic realm and into the real world. Crash landing on Earth, Thor is hit by the car of astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). She's been investigating the gateways between the real and magical worlds in the New Mexico desert. When her data is stolen by shady government agents, who have also set up a perimeter around the engraved hammer, she enlists the help of Thor to get both of their items back.

","Not being a fan of Marvel Comics or of the endless transformations into cinema that these silly stories are seeing, THOR was not high on the list to view. Seeing it without the 3D variation that accompanied the theatrical release was a further detriment in deciding to watch it, but when a director of the caliber of Kenneth Branagh and a cast of both seasoned performers and exciting new faces pass the credit notification then it is tempting to give it a try. The surprise is that this is a very entertaining movie.

All of those slanted camera angles and quick shots during the action made it look out of touch.
Also (and I've seen other comments on this) the romantic sub-plot between Thor and Jane was just out of place and unnecessary in this film. I'm not that familiar with how their relationship was in the comics, but I realize there was some love interest between the two but it just seemed like an afterthought here and not done well.

","Thor was one of two films by Marvel Studios released during the summer of 2011, the other being Captain America: The First Avenger. Both Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Captain America (Chris Evans) appeared in The Avengers (2012), a film that I initially didn't like much but after some time have grown to appreciate. The Avengers is a superb superhero film, one of the best of all time in fact. In Thor the best performance is by Tom Hiddleston as Loki. Tom again played Loki as the main villain in The Avengers. Loki is clearly up to no good but Hiddleston managed to show that he's a complex sympathetic character. Hemsworth was a good choice to play Thor, the crown prince of Asgard. With his dirty blond hair and ridiculously chiseled physique Hemsworth has plenty of charisma as Thor. The humor is frequent here and so is the action. The CGI was put to good use, and the realization of Asgard and the Bifrost is especially impressive. Still, the center of the film is the relation between Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and his two sons. Director Kenneth Branagh was a good choice to tell this drama reminiscent of a play by William Shakespeare. Hopkins is a commanding presence as Odin, so his is another standout performance. But really, all the actors deliver here. There's Sif (Jaimie Alexander) and the Warriors Three, there's Heimdall (Idris Elba), and there's Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). The love story is a bit rushed since Thor and Jane fall in love by the fire with a starry night sky behind them. The pacing too isn't perfect but Thor is a thrilling film which can improve just about anyone's mood. Patrick Doyle delivered a good score, and the Foo Fighters song Walk was also included in the film.

","From director Kenneth Branagh (Henry V, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Hamlet), I saw a trailer and some clips of this film, but I didn't realise until a little later that the story was based on Marvel comics, so that made me keen to see it. Basically in the outer space past world of Asgard, King Odin (Sir Anthony Hopkins) once waged a war against the Frost Giants of Jotunheim and their King Laufey (Colm Feore) who want to take over the nine realms, starting with Earth, and now his son Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is due to ascend to the throne. This ascending is interrupted when the frost giants attempt to steal the power source known as the Casket of Ancient Winters, and Thor with his arrogance takes his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), childhood friend Sif (Jaimie Alexander) and the Warriors Three: Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Fandral (Joshua Dallas) and Hogun (Tadanobu Asano) to retrieve it. The battle that ensues causes the end of the truce between the two sides of the war, and Odin punishes Thor by taking his power and banishing him from the kingdom to be mortal on Earth, also sending his power source, the hammer Mjolnir, to be found by the worthy warrior. Landing in the deserts of Mexico he is found by astrophysicist Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), assistant Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings), and mentor Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård), while the hammer is found by local people, and soon surrounded by officials from S.H.I.E.L.D., with Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) in charge. Thor tries to retrieve Mjolnir, but he is unable to lift it from the ground, and he is captured by the agents, but Selvig helps him escape, and seemingly unable to gain his power back he focuses on a romance with Jane. Back in Asgard, Loki has discovered that he is not the real son of Odin, he was abandoned by the snow giants and taken at the end of the original war, so for revenge he forces Odin into a coma, becomes the new king, and offers Laufey the chance to kill Odin and retrieve the Casket, but the Warriors Three and Sif know of this plan. So they convince gatekeeper Heimdall (Idris Elba) to travel to Earth and find Thor, while Loki sends a Destroyer to find and kill his adversary, and after a battle Thor sacrifices himself to save everyone, and this act earns him his hammer and power to return. With his powers restored he defeats the Destroyer, he says a sad goodbye to Jane and the others, he returns to Asgard to confront Loki, who has betrayed and killed Laufey, and he destroys the bridge that allows them to go to Earth, and Loki falls into the abyss below, and he gives up Odin making him king. Also starring Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye, Rene Russo as Frigga, Idris Elba as Heimdall, Stan Lee as Stan the Man and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury. Hemsworth proves himself a worthy leading actor as the strong willed and heroic warrior, Portman is sweet as the hero's love interest, Hiddleston does a good job as the nasty villain, and Hopkins in his time brings his usual great seriousness, and director Branagh actually proves a director with good pace and vision. The story is an easy one to follow, and it obviously builds up to Avengers Assemble, just like Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk did, the special effects are fantastic, and there are some great moments of action to catch your eye, an enjoyable fantasy adventure.

","Thor I would say is not my personal go-to superhero. I knew of him. I'd seen the character in different forms of media and comic books, but he was never the standout for me. I was young when this film was upon release and I was very little aware of the film's existence or it's placement in the MCU. The moment I found out about the connection was in the Iron Man 2 post-credits scene. If you read my review for that, you'll see that I didn't exactly watch the film until it's home release. I wasn't aware that the post-credits were a trend at the time. After watching the first Thor trailer and then researching it, I came across the scene. Now again I didn't watch this film in cinemas. I watched it with a close friend, and we were both mildly impressed. And over the years I have seen and read many mixed reviews, but I still maintain that this is one of the better produced and made films in the MCU!
POSITIVES!
Now I understand the audience reactions that come from this film. Ones that think because the character isn't kicking ass throughout the film that it's boring. I don't think that at all. There is action. Not an insane amount, but enough to show you what the character can do. But this is a great character arc. One, I thought, so great that it made Thor my favourite Avenger for a time. This is something I love about the plot and writing. This is a character driven story with a character that rises above selfishness and arrogance. The writing overall has a very Shakespeare charm about it. A story about family, and, brotherhood. Tom Hiddleston portrays the antagonist in this film, and he is brilliant. You instantly understand his motive and the actor's approach to a ""villain"" and so well deserving of the praise the character and actor has received throughout the MCU. But this film is packed full of amazing talent. Whether they a good or not, the actors that are involved are all talented in their acting background. I must praise rich and unblemished cinematography. This is a beautiful film to look at. The visual effects are stunning as well as is the artwork behind them. It is a great blend of having these God-like characters in this comic book world. The costume and makeup departments have very immaculate work. Brilliant sound design, particularly with Thor's Might Hammer, Mjolnir. A pungent score, that I think is improved on, but it works for this film.
MIXED!
Chris Hemsworth stars in the title role. An actor that had only gotten a starring role on soap-operas in Australia. This was the big break for the actor, and he is okay. Obviously over the course of his own and The Avengers' franchises he has really delivered an entertaining character. But in this film, he is adequate. Now the director of this film Kenneth Branagh does a fine job. Some of his camerawork was a bit off, especially with the dutch-angles. But I feel as if his main intention in this film was to deliver a grand scale epic drama rather than a comic book film.",/review/rw2429213/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_(2011

","Boy, was THOR average. Absolutely nothing on screen surprised me (other than a scene I apparently missed which I guess appears after the entire end credits). Basically, Thor is a hotheaded warrior who just smacks ice monster men with his hammer and/or tackles them and later humans who are guarding his hammer on Earth where it lands in a desert and becomes like Excalibur's sword where no one can pull it out. The actor who plays Thor looks great and is very likable, but the rest of the cast just walks through the paces. Natalie Portman's character could have been played by anyone, Anthony Hopkins seems bored and tired, and the cute Amanda Sefreid is completely wasted and adds absolutely nothing to the proceedings as Portman's pal. The story is: Thor's about to become King but the ceremony is interrupted by a few ice monster creatures who are Thor's people's sworn enemies. Thor and a few of his buddies attack that race's world without a plan which causes the King to banish Thor to Earth without powers as his hammer is stuck in a desert a la Excalibur. Meantime, Thor's brother takes over as King and (no) surprise turns out to be kind of a traitor. Boring. A giant Iron Man looking thing is sent to Earth by Thor's brother, Thor asks it to spare the Earthlings and kill him, which it apparently does with one smack to the face. Then Anthony Hopkins' sleeping king sheds a tear as he telepathically hears how kind Thor is now (he has transformed from hotheaded to understanding in no time) and frees Thor's hammer which flies into Thor's hand, waking him up and allowing him to beat the tar of of the Iron Man robot thing in seconds flat. His buddies came to visit him for a few seconds before this, couldn't fight the monster for squat, and then they all return home so Thor can beat up his brother. The end. Until the post credit scene nobody stayed for. Too bad. I really like the concept of Thor and Nordic legend type warriors/gods. This story was really simple and offered absolutely nothing new to filmdom. Where IRON MAN rocked in a half humorous/half serious super hero way, the Tim Burton BATMAN movies were visual masterpieces, the Toby MacGuire SPIDERMAN movies were fun and colorful comic books come to life, and the newer BATMAN movies were dark and serious, THOR doesn't really make much of its own mark (although lots of the CGI bridge scenes make the characters look like tiny sized ants instead of big warriors when they walk upon them if that's a visual distinction albeit not a very good one). Not enough humor, not enough pathos, and not enough action to make it stand out (the coolest and most memorable action moment comes when Thor uses his hammer to fly through a monster's mouth and comes out the back of its head; the other fighting is pretty uninspired and consists of a lot of punching, basic kicks, and tackling which is fine and fairly realistic but not anything that stands out as extraordinarily memorable). THOR misses the potential to cash in on both the fish out of water and the Men In Black/CIA being a hindrence story lines. Hope Thor's next movie tops this one which should be an easy task. It doesn't stink, but it's just nothing to hoot about. Oh, and see it in 2-D. The 3-D scenes are really few and far between. All they added to the experience was a foil greater than Thor's brother as they made it hard to see when walking down the stairs at the hour twenty mark on the way to the can after a 20 dollar movie drink.",/review/rw2429213/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_(2011

In ""Thor,"" Portman is simply miscast. She is not a warm actor meant to play in romantic films(that is more Amy Adams' vocation), but instead a cold and efficient actor who is more suited to roles where she is expected to play a villain or someone socially awkward (if not anti-social) or a gifted prodigy with inner demons. Yet director Kenneth Branaugh and the producers put her in this film where she is expected to play a romantic lead -- something that she never did very well throughout her two-decades long career. As a result, every romantic scene with Portman looks forced from the flirtation to the laughing to the kissing scene. She does all these scenes with professional efficiency, but that unfortunately is the problem. There is nothing professional or efficient about love.

The comics have been written by numerous talented writers taking in many different variations on the character and include stories that adhere rigidly to the myths and are set in Asgard, or that are modern superhero stories with Thor in contemporary earth (Midgard) as well as cosmic comic book stories where Thor fights aliens in outer space. With the comics this all adds up to a rich, though often confusing, depth to the character and his history – something that tends to be true for most comic book characters that have lasted for a long time: there are debates about what is canon and what never really happened; things get re-imagined or revised – over 50 years these characters can develop and change tremendous amounts.

","Upon re-watching Thor tonight for the first time in nearly seven years, I was thoroughly entertained. Thor is a well made film and a worthy entry of the God of Thunder into the MCU. Tom Hiddleston does a great job as Loki and Chris Hemsworth is awesome as Thor. This film does have cliche, especially with the love story between Thor and Jane (Natalie Portman). It's sometimes silly but doesn't detract too much. This film does a good job at introducing information to us about the outer realms that will be important in the MCU for years to come. The special effects lack at times and there are some lazy edit jobs during some major action sequences. The charm of Thor and his discovery of what has happened to him after he is sent to earth is really a fun part of this film and it is rather enjoyable to watch.

306,6 May 2011,poe426,10," Kirby doth live!
","At long last, the cosmic concepts that Jack Kirby wrought with imagination and artistry have been rewrought for the big screen with the flamboyant filmmaking (and cgi) of Kenneth Branagh. As per Kirby's dictum that ""comics shouldn't REFLECT reality, they should TRANSCEND it,"" THOR the motion picture TRANSCENDS. (Not in a WATCHMEN kind of way, but Transcendent, nonetheless.) JOURNEY INTO MYSTERY #83 was a dramatic departure from the standard 1950s Atomic Age movie-inspired origins of most of the Marvel super heroes. (Kirby had been using Thor in comics prior to that- his hammer even turned up in a western, at one point-, but, this time around, he zeroed in on the gallant God of Thunder and his homeworld of Asgard.) The result was a comic book that I personally felt outstripped everything that had come before it. (See my comments regarding Kirby's death in a newspaper article that appeared shortly thereafter at capefearcomics.webs or on our facebook site.) Kirby was an artist whose cosmic sensibilities were never really tempered by his blue collar work ethic: he was a visionary in the field, and a quick perusal of any one of the four black and white reprint volumes of the THOR saga (inked by MY all-time favorite Kirby inker, Vince Colletta) clearly shows WHY. Like Bruce Lee, Jack Kirby was an inspiration to those of us who were paying attention- and, like Bruce Lee, Kirby represented the promise of Unlimited Potential. Gods knows this movie doesn't QUITE live up to its promise, but it's close enough for now. I'll leave you now with a few words from Mark Evanier's beautiful Afterword to KIRBY: KING OF COMICS: ""Heroism was much more heroic, villainy was all the more villainous, and love was just plain lovelier.""

310,15 May 2011,zetes,8," Perfectly decent superhero flick
","Marvel re-uses its Iron Man strategy by throwing far too much talent at a comic book movie. The results are, much like with Iron Man, actually pretty good, though quite far from great. Chris Hemsworth stars as the Norse god. The story takes place in both Asgard and Midgard (Earth). In Asgard, Thor has led an attack against the Frost Giants. Odin, his father (Anthony Hopkins), banishes Thor to Earth and gives his kingdom over to Thor's scheming brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston). The other gods (including a black and Asian one, although, who cares, they're played by Idris Elba and Tadanobu Asano!) are suspicious of Loki and plan to get Thor back. On Earth, Thor is now a mortal. A big dude, still, but he finds that little things like getting hit by cars to be quite painful. He's discovered by a team of astrophysicists (Natalie Portman, in her third movie of 2011, Stellan Skarsgard and Kat Dennings). Portman thinks that Thor might know something about the weird atmospheric disturbances she's been documenting lately. It's a fun movie. Although it's mostly just CGI, Asgard is always great to look at. When they do use sets, they're cool. And the costume design, while a tad silly, is wonderful to look at. The Earth sequences would probably be a lot less fun, but the writers have a great sense of humor. The fish-out-of-water stuff is very funny, especially the scene where Thor enters a pet store and demands a horse. The actors mostly do a good job. Hemsworth, a relative newcomer, looks like he might be a mindless hunk or a wrestler-turned-actor, but he does a good job. He has a certain charm which most people who look like underwear models don't. Portman kind of fails, but the script is mostly to blame. There's very little time for a romantic angle, but they've shoved it in anyway, and it's pretty unconvincing. My favorite performances were from Hiddleston, who perhaps has the most complexly written character in the movie, and Elba, whom I didn't recognize at first past his costume and glowing yellow eyes. He's definitely the coolest character in the movie. Kat Dennings is really funny with her scene-stealing role as a political science student who is only working with Portman for the college credits. Dennings is a star in the making (check her out in the excellent Defendor) and probably should already be bigger than she is. One could complain that there's too much setting up of the Avengers movie, due out next year, but I generally don't mind that. I like the connectedness of the Marvel films (this one calls out Iron Man and the Hulk). A couple of the Avengers preview sequences are somewhat confusing, though. Like that guy who looks a little like Jeremy Renner (played by Jeremy Renner) who is ordered to snipe Thor but then picks up a bow and arrow, or the completely baffling post-credits sequence with Samuel L. Jackson (seriously, I couldn't make any sense of what was going on there).",/review/rw2429213/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_(2011

Howvever, I have to admit that 'Thor' was always the film I was least looking forward too since Ironman and Cap are my favourites of the team and I also doubted if adapting the Thor comic book was going to end well. Luckily, I was very wrong! 'Thor' sets up the premise that the legends of the Norse gods are, in fact, powerful aliens who inhabit Asgard, one of nine worlds connected to each other through a wormhole system known as the Rainbow Bridge. Thor is a cocky and egotistical prince who is preparing to succeed his father Odin as king, much to his younger brother Loki's quiet resentment. However, when Thor's arrogance leads the race of Ice Giants (who reside on another of the nine worlds) to declare war on Asgard, Odin casts his son out in the hopes of teaching him humility. Thor then finds himself stranded on Earth, powerless and mortal with only scientist Jane Foster and her friends to aid him.

","Thor is not a good movie, but it is not a bad one either. I don't regret paying money to see it. But the major negative thing about it, is that it had the potential to be sooo much better. I guess it has everything it needs to in order to appeal to a wider audience. There's action, drama, intrigue, comedy, love and geeky insider knowledge and cameos. But it excels in none. The action is...half-assed at best. Not really exciting except for maybe a single short battle, the climax is clumsy and sluggish, not to mention, over way too quickly. The characters...well, Thor looks the part...and sounds the part, but he just doesn't seem like a three dimensional character. He seems like an actor trying his best. His character development is awkward and cliché, not to mention how he changes from arrogant and self-serving, to protective, honorable and gentle almost overnight. Natalie Portman's character is utterly forgettable. I like her as an actor, but her character in this movie...honestly, I wouldn't care if she lived or died. Other characters seemed mostly like filler. Anthony Hopkins played...well himself, and did alright. The Loke character wasn't bad, but also very forgettable. The only truly memorable character would be Heimdal, who is pretty awesome. Thors friends - Sif and the other three guys...I face-palmed over and over again. Okay, Sif looks the part, but all in all they were pathetic. Come on! You're supposed to be Gods...throw some cars, rip up some lampposts, knock those bad boys around...but no. They can't even charge the opponent without a 'leg-up' from their friends. The comedy part has it moments where you laugh or smile a little, but at many times it's pretty awkward and lame. The romance is irrelevant and the political drama seems contrived and unimaginative. Many superhero films lately have utterly failed (Spiderman 3, The Hulk 1+2, Daredevil, Elektra, Wolverine, X-men 3 and so on), and unfortunately this one joins the list of forgettable movies that, in my opinion should not have been made. And this also brings me to the subject of The Avengers Movie that is coming soon. It seems like they just need to get all there other movies done with, so they can get to the real juicy stuff.

","A truly excellent film, accompanied by a powerful story. Hugely entertaining comic-book adventure that delivers pretty much everything you could want from a Thor movie, thanks to an outstanding script, note-flawless direction from Kenneth Branagh, a tremendous supporting cast and a charismatic, star-making central performance from Chris Hemsworth. The special effects are extraordinary and seemed extensively real. In addition, the fight scenes are nicely handled and the visual effects are impressive, especially in the Halls of Asgard. That said, while the post-production 3D has come out well unlike Clash of the Titans.What was even more interesting was too see how the god's transformation from being an immortal into a mortal didn't change the person who he was.

","In the realm known as Asgard, ""Thor"" (Chris Hemsworth) is about to be sworn in as the new king by his father ""Odin"" (Anthony Hopkins). Out of jealousy his brother ""Loki"" (Tom Hiddleston) arranges for some Frost Giants to appear which causes the ceremony to be interrupted. While Odin considers the incident as an unfortunate inconvenience, Thor believes it to be a violation of a peace agreement between Asgard and the Frost Giants and decides to venture to Jotunheim to teach them a lesson. Odin commands him not to take matters into his own hands. Thor disobeys and with a few companions ventures to the kingdom of the Frost Giants anyway. This turns out to be a big mistake as Thor and his friends are surrounded and would have been killed had Odin not suddenly appeared to rescue them in the nick of time. Once back in Asgard Odin is furious and casts Thor down to Earth as a mortal human being. Anyway, rather than detail the rest of the story and risk spoiling the film for those who haven't seen it, I will just say that I think that this is one of the best ""comic book"" movies ever made.

","This is as solid a Marvel Comics superhero flick as we have come to expect. While I cannot say to have been much enthused when it was first announced (in view of my unfamiliarity with lead Chris Hemsworth), I kept the faith given the involvement of director Branagh – which is not too surprising since he treats the larger-than-life proceedings as if they were a Shakespearean tragedy (which made his reputation to begin with) and, in any case, he had already dabbled in fantasy with the interesting if overblown MARY SHELLEY'S FRANKENSTEIN (1994). In hindsight, this proved almost as refreshing as IRON MAN (2008) where, similarly, the human element had emerged in spite of the predictable barrage of action (notably a battle sequence early on) and special effects (the look of Asgard is impressive alright, yet the 3-D is – as ever – sparingly adopted throughout, thus not justifying the ticket-price increase!).",/review/rw2429213/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_(2011

Finally that happened with Kenneth Branagh's Thor. This is an excellent movie with drama, romance, humor, and action. It's quite simply one of the best Marvel has put out so far and a personal favorite of mine. For comic fans, yes they change a few things but they keep the heart of the story and characters intact. As one lifelong Thor fan, I have no complaints. He's a character many said for years would be impossible to sell a movie about. But those people have been proved wrong.

390,2 May 2011,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,8," Where *did* this come from?
","Because of his being too headstrong, Thor, the god of thunder, is banished to the worst place imaginable... Earth. He is stripped of his powers, immortality and Mjolnir. And when the mischievous Loki(a surprisingly deep role, and played to perfection with manipulation) learns a secret, more trouble comes his way. The evil Ice Giants of Jotunheim, who have had dealings with the duo's father Odin, are part of it. Perhaps I should make it clear that I'm not a fan of the comics, although I love the Norse myth. It was strange to hear that Branagh was going to make this, and I suppose what happened is really what we should all have realized would. He tried to do it as Shakespeare(hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it), and some will be surprised to find that it works out really well. The focus is on the family drama between the three aforementioned and the father/son conflict, and it's incredibly easy to relate to. In addition, this is a classic adventure tale, the young, brash boy who has to get by in the outside world before he can return home and claim his father's place. Note that we don't see a lot of the titular deity using his abilities(and thankfully he doesn't don that silly helmet much) in this, and he is mortal for the majority of it. This does a magnificent job of setting up the strength of these beings, and still making us feel scared for them. The action tends to be great(apart from the all-human martial arts, that are awkwardly shot and edited for some reason... maybe to hide the stunt performer, I don't know), if the very best of it is at the very start. You also have to wonder why we see less than a dozen Asgardians... well, no, the answer is of course that they had to juggle the two worlds(and it does well, we never lose track), and ours is the grounding factor. On that note, their realm is indeed awe-inspiring, beautifully animated and captured, and the 3D only adds to the epic scope of it(worth the price of admission in my book). Bifrost is nice, even if it is evidently made from the same material as the sidewalk from Billie Jean. While the love story is not the strongest aspect, it works OK(Hemsworth is sufficiently charming). The acting is fine, with a few standout performances(Hiddle and Hopkins, especially). We get some ""fish out of water"" stuff, and it's adequately balanced to not be annoying. The Marvel-verse cameos are cool. This tries to be funny *a lot*, and thankfully, it does tend to work(it is forced at other times). The script has a few hiccups, and the characters aren't as memorable as they could be. Stay after the credits, for your own sake(if you're at all into these). Since we see it really early on, I can comment on the Destroyer... it's as bland as its name(also, The Day The Earth Stood Still called, it wants Gort back), honestly, you have this cornucopia of fascinating creatures and you come up with a shiny robot with halitosis? All in all, definitely a fun ride, largely satisfying and it works well.

","Thor (2011): Dir: Kenneth Branaugh / Cast: Chris Hemsworth, Anthony Hopkins, Tom Hiddleston, Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgard: Impressive adaptation of the classic Marvel comic book superhero. Thor is famous for his hammer weapon, which sustains certain power. His father led the war that defeated the Frost Giants. He has two sons, one being Thor whom is about to be crown King, and the other is Loki who is jealous. Kenneth Branaugh seems a strange choice to direct this material but he pulls it off with breathtaking visual effects of skyscrapers of gold and silver. He previously brought Hamlet new life. Chris Hemsworth brings out the youthful nature of Thor. As the film opens he hurls to Earth after being banished for leading retaliation against the Frost Giants. He is discovered by three science researchers where he is under watch and struggles to adapt since his powers are gone. His hammer is embedded in the desert and nobody can free it. Anthony Hopkins plays Odin, his father who has conquered yet demonstrates authority when he is tricked to banish Thor. He will be reduced too a heart attack until contrivance prevails. Tom Hiddleston as Loki is a worthy villain who betrays his people. This will all be settled with the standard corny violent showdown. Natalie Portman as the researcher who discovers Thor is reduced to useless romantic clichés unworthy of her talent especially after winning an Academy Award for a superior role.

","Though the central character arc is relatively complete and almost constantly at the heart of the piece, the transformation from arrogant and frankly annoying Asgardian to humbled and king-worthy warrior occurs pretty late on and over just a couple of scenes. Because of this, though its motivations and key moments do generally land, 'Thor (2011)' tends to feel fairly rushed and its payoff never seems quite as important as the flick wants it to. The best moments are the ones where the eponymous hero acts as a 'fish out of water' in his newfound dimension, as these are the sequences that provide the most character development and the least overly serious exposition. In contrast, the action set-pieces are honestly some of the worst moments because they're choppily edited and the CGI leaves something to be desired. In the end, it's really the fact that the piece is so contrived and actually pretty consistently dull that cements it as possibly the worst that the 'MCU' has to offer, tied only with its equally monotonous sequel. 5/10.",/review/rw2429213/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_(2011

But this movie ! Movies these days have to have some character development so that the characters aren't completely 2 dimensional. This movie was like an explosion in a special effects studio. One CGI scene after another with some pretty bad acting sequences in between. The Marvel Thor comics have always been quite clever at incorporating Norse mythology into the stories. Wasn't Dr Donald Blake meant to be Thor when he originally found the hammer? Here we have Natalie Portman as Jane saying her ex was Dr Donald Blake and gurning. What was all that about? Then we have the 'blink and you've missed it' scene where Thor transforms from a war mongering selfish oaf, to Odin's favourite son again. What was the dramatic sequence of events to cause such a transformation, because i think i missed them? The characters were the embodiments of a cliched am dram production. The simpering stormchasing Jane who has a thing for buff men. The old scientist dude who says 'no' to everything. The geeky character who says geeky things. Please. Marvel, please treat your viewers with a little more intelligence than this. Do yourself a favour. If you like Thor, read the comic. I can't believe Sir Kenneth Branagh was involved in this either.

And that seems to be the crux of this popcorn flick. He's the son of the king, he will inherit the throne, yet his father doesn't think he's worthy. While he has a jealous younger brother who thinks he could do a better job, and feels betrayed. It sounds perfect for the classically trained Kenneth Branagh. Yet his choice to place the action on Earth, to remove Thor of Mjolnir, seems to be his way of creating Thors beginning. To build from a petulant boy, into a hero. Yes, it's heavy on special effects.

Although it may not be as ambitious as say Endgame or even its follow-up in 2012, The Avengers, Thor is an incredibly exciting and satisfying spectacle- and personally one of my favorite MCU flicks to date. It's not perfect by far, there are several cornier moments throughout. As it is 2011- some of the CGI can be a bit noticeable at times- although hardly as much as Iron Man or its sequel. Some dialogue is a bit corny, and the romance element is rather obvious- but it plays all with such charm and genuine wonder that it's hard to not walk out of the film smiling. Chris Hemsworth is absolutely perfect in the titular role of Thor, and equally so with Tom Hiddleston's Loki, and Anthony Hopkins Odin. The fight scenes are incredibly well done, well shot, and rather entertaining. The film feels like an mythological epic playing out on screen, and I truly enjoyed every minute of it. It takes a lot of ambition to make this film, and it shows, but somehow it really does work- and I admire it for it. The makeup in the film is excellent, practical and not noticeable CGI like some other superhero projects, and the color palate and look of the film is incredibly beautiful and wondrous.

The scenes with the banished, cheerful, humanized Thor are very charming; and serve to reacquaint viewers with nobility in the male gender (pretty much absent in 2011), much like in the awful Kate and Leopold. I didn't care that it lacked great action setpieces per se, but the climax is a bit too underscaled. Still, I was very moved at least twice; when the King realizes that he must regrettably teach his beloved but ignorant son a whopper of a lesson; and when Thor failed at retrieving his hammer (of all things). Heimdall, the bridge guard, reminds a viewer that old school qualities suffice beautifully in producing a figure of admiration. He's unflinching in his devotion, he's 'steady'. The plot is slightly familiar (The central idea of The Sword in the Stone is lifted shamelessly), but the acting is good, and it's better with language than most movies; which I suspect can be credited to Kenneth Branagh.

","I just got back from seeing Thor at my local theatre, and I have to admit I was impressed by it. To those who are wondering to go see it or not, you should it's different then the other super hero movies. Thor is based on the marvel comic of the same name, it's of course about the God of thunder Thor. The movie starts off on earth, then changes to Asgard. I have to admit the Asgard scenes were some of the best visuals I've ever seen in a movie, some of the visuals even match that of Avatar. Of course all of the actors were great. Loki was just a bad ass I wasn't expecting to like him but I did. For once they made you feel for the villain they gave him emotion. Loki is quite the character and by the end of the movie you kind of end up feeling sorry for him and the way he's been treated. Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddston give the best performances of the whole movie I have to admit. The action scenes were great in the movie, exactly what you would expect from Thor. The movie ends with a bang, and if you don't know already there's a scene after the credits, so stay for that. Now I saw this in 3D so as far as that goes, the movie did a good job with it, it's the best 3D converted movie I have seen, but not the best 3D movie. Some of the scenes really didn't seem 3D, which is why it's only decent 3D for, the scenes that really worked in 3D were Asgard and the action scenes. I'd say go see it in 3D if you like 3D movies, but 2D would be just as good. Anyway I'm giving Thor a 10/10.",/review/rw2429213/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_(2011

","I just watched this for the first time; fast forwarding through the CGI trash. I stopped after Hemsworth and his friends flew back to Asgard. I look at this ""film"" as a perfect example of what started the end of true cinema. It only proves a simple fact: If anything is packaged and marketed enough (whatever ""anything"" may be), the masses will accept it. The very best story telling via cinema us done by a small handful of incredibly gifted directors. Unfortunately, the best are dead; however, there are still a few who are exceptional. This and all other comic book films are not amongst them. Enjoy it all you want; just don't try and compare it with real artists: people like the two best masters of them all: Stanley Kubrick and Orson Welles. We still have Marty Scorcese, Terrence Malick, Neal Jordan, Ridley Scott and his heir apparent, Denis Villeneuve. So this ( and other ""superhero"") type of movie is great if you're 13 years old. If your in your 20's and up, forget it. I suggest watching every film Kubrick made: a dozen plus one he removed. Also, all of the actor Steve McQueen's films (not today's director, who is good); lastly all the great 1970's films. Then make up your mind. As Martin Scorcese wrote an op-ed in the New York Times recently, he basically explained he wasn't denigrating this type of film in an interview he had done in Great Britain. He received a lot of pushback which is why he wrote the op-ed: To explain how these type of films, studios, theaters and their P.P. and marketing strategies done on Late night talk shows promoting themselves (so to speak), they have caused an extreme loss of Independent films (and their corresponding theaters).

The film goes at it hammer and tongs to forge some good spectacle for the viewer. Tom Hiddleston produces a good performance as the weaker of the two sons who claims power unduly when this is taken from the heir. Chris Hemsworth makes a good fist of the role, convincing us of the Thunder God's alpha male traits. The visual effects of the distant realm are pleasingly colourful but a little distracting by their confection - we are expected to use our imagination for such a place but it looks computer generated rather than mystical. The fight scenes and use of sound are tremendous and there is great support and talent on offer. How the film is held together depends on story and that is where the film disappears down the wormhole, so to speak. It is essentially a bridging of special effects sequences and not much is built in feeling for us to care about. Certainly there is not enough feeling between the brothers for us to think Thor cares quite as much about his brother by the end. All the fantastical characters are not interesting.

Wow the movie starts with the Bang, the director doesn't shy away from throwing Thor right into our faces.

The director Kenneth Branagh presented the Asgard world with so much conviction that it didn't look strange at all. Thor with his giant Hammer is something to watch. The charisma and arrogance Mr. Hemsworth carries is Commendable. Marvel got the Perfect Thor and Loki. On one side Thor is perfect God of Thunder, Loki is a perfect mischief Child. Tom Hiddleston did a fantastic job in playing Loki. I was completely stunned by his honest emotional and devious portray. Natalie Portman is delightful; it feels good to see a girl in a movie. Who you really adore, that totally boosts up the screen. After winning an Oscar, Natalie Portman is on heights. And this role added an additional Blockbuster in to her lap. I hope she returns for Thor 2, because only then it will be more convincing to see Thor coming back for Jane. Though apparently, Thor will return to earth in ""The Avengers"" with all other Marvel Heroes. So, it'll be interesting to see how it all set up together. Kat Denning did make me laugh with her on liners. Besides them Jaimie Alexander did stood out as she looked Stunning as Sif. Anthony Hopkins, Stellan Skarsgård, Jean Russo, Idris Alba, Clark Gregg and Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye are really good. With all perfect casting, performances, CGI, the only thing lacking in the end was Big Earthly Action Sequence. The town looked too small and fake to be real.

","As soon as I started watching this movie, I said to myself, ""Oh no, Oh NO, there are too MANY people in this film!"" I wanted to watch for one reason only: to see my old friend Thor, the God of THUNDER! But there are literally hundreds of other characters in this film, many of whom are simply in the background, never given any dialogue or explanation. How was I supposed to know where they were going or what they were doing if they never even got a close-up? My knowledge of Norse mythology was simply no help, because so much has been changed in this adaptation, and the people in these newer films are just so small. Like I said to a friend of mine afterwards, children these days are so productive, thanks to modern technology, that they simply have too MUCH time to read comics and learn complicated back-stories. I confess I felt a little left behind, because the rest of the audience had clearly done their research and had no problem following this story of thousands. On a positive note, I must praise the musical soundtrack of this film. Though modern storytelling leaves me behind, little has changed in the musical world, and thanks to a lifetime of watching movies I was able to anticipate which moments were intended alternately to terrify, excite, or titillate me, and to react appropriately! Thus the movie became a blind, primal roller-coaster ride of an experience; despite having no intellectual understanding of what I was seeing, I was able, like a child or a drug addict, to follow it emotionally in full or even more than full capacity.

One of the funniest scenes was when Thor asked for a horse at the pet store. I thought Anthony Hopkins was intimidating but noble and real intense as Odin. I liked when he stripped Thor of his power and banished him. Tom Hiddleston gave a wickedly funny performance as Thor's jealous step sibling Loki. He was evil but had reasons to hate Thor. He was weaker and not super-handsome like Thor. He was a great villain, I liked his armor and his horned-helmet was creepy as hell. I liked it when Loki went to earth and he was dressed like a businessman. I loved the battle at the end between Thor and Loki. Stellan Skarsgard was great in his brief role.

Granted, I saw this movie with my theatre group after an exhausting play week at 11:00 at night. But that may just have been the movie's saving grace for me. If my friends and I hadn't been so exhausted that everything was funny, I probably wouldn't have made it through the ending. I love Kenneth Branaugh. Anthony Hopkins is amazing. Natalie Portman just got an Academy Award. But none of them could make anything of this movie. The acting was awful. The sounds were way too loud. The effects were unbelievably dumb. All of the flying scenes were hilarious. I can't even describe them. And when Thor is lying there dying, and his hammer suddenly flies through the air, and he reaches up and catches it in conjunction with the lightning and epic music... Oh man. So hilarious. And I may be a writing snob, but there was no character arc. Thor went from arrogant and stupid and annoying to kind, peaceful, humble, stupid and annoying. So yeah. Don't spend money to see this in theaters. If you're curious, at least wait for it to come out on DVD. I'm not really a superhero movie person, but our theatre director is. And she didn't like it.

From 2011 comes the fourth entry into the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe), as Marvel and Kevin Feigie expand their superhero movie empire. This film introduces Thor to the universe who is one of the main legs of the tripod that will become the Avengers along with Tony Stark and Steve Rogers. Thor is one of the few superheroes represented that doesn't employ a persona as he is a demigod from the realm of Asgard and pretty much just is superhero and a force of nature unto himself. He is impeccably embodied by Chris Hemsworth in yet another wonderful casting decision by Marvel. The cast here as a whole is quite good including Anthony Hopkins, Natalie Portman, Kat Dennings, Stellan Skarsgard and Tom Hiddleston among others. The other real standout is Hiddleston as Thor's brother Loki who is equal parts good guy and bad guy although in the MCU infancy he is much more slanted to the side of ill intent. He will become a fixture in many of the MCU film stories going forward. While not an origin story this film does a good job of introducing all these characters so that we know who they are, what they are and where they exist in the story as a whole which is important considering we haven't seen any of these characters on screen before.",/review/rw2429213/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_(2011

However, not everything is flowers and after the rainbow there is not always a pot of gold. In terms of acting, Natalie Portman was a bit off and left more to be desired due to her fame. Talking about the plot, the cinematic turnaround will not satisfy everyone, as it should be noted that psychological transformations occurred to the protagonist very quickly, without any trace shown of the passage of himself to be worthy of the hammer, just an unexplained passion. She also left the supporting cast wanting, like Thor's little friends who started the movie at that up, fell in the middle, and ended the plot by nothing less than a loose and miscalculated point in the script.

","So, next up from the Marvel Comics pantheon is Thor, or the Mighty Thor as he was known to fans (or Goldilocks, as he was to Ben Grimm). Here, we have a tale of Norse gods filtered through a lens of superheroes. Thor is the arrogant son of Odin, ruler of Asgard, and the time has come for him to take the throne. At his side is his brother (half brother in mythology, bit more complicated here) Loki, the trickster god. Everything looks hunky-dory, until a commando team of frost giants enters Asgard to try to take back their power source (we get a Lord of the Rings-style history lesson into the Asgardians and the frost giants, as well as the relation to myth). Thor, defying his father (and with a bit of easy prodding by Loki) goes of looking for answers as to why the FG's have broken the truce; or, more precisely, to kick some ice. Thor and his buddies indulge in a bit of mayhem and are rescued when the frost hits the fan, and a lecture from pop. Dad is so mad he grounds Thor, literally, exiling him to our world (if our world had armored billionaires, green-skinned monsters, and we fought HYDRA in World War II). There, we indulge in some fish-out-of-water hijinks, a bit of puppy love, some violence, and we're off to the races.",/review/rw2429213/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_(2011

","Movie review:OK, slightly behind (I kind of forgot to watch this) but excuses aside, I enjoyed this movie. Yes, I am a comic geek, so may be a tad biased, although admittedly I did not read ""Thor"" so the rating is on movie merits alone. The movie follows the life of a ""G-d"" in the form of Thor(Chris Hemsworth), who is the god of thunder. He is raised in Asgard to become the heir of the throne to a pseudo-Greek mythological type world of people with extraordinary powers. When Thors arrogance to unleash a war upon a race of frost giants that has been ensuing for many years breaks the code of a treaty of peace, Thor is banished from Asgard without his powers and his mighty hammer to the end of the worlds, or as we know it, Earth. Yes there is a side story to all this, but it is weaved between events on Asgard and Earth to tell the hows and whys of the occurrences leading to Thors punishment. Well, now on Earth, without any power and no sense of what being mortal actually is which leads to some humorous scenes, he meets his new friends by being hit by a car containing astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her associates Professor Selvig (Stellan Skarsgaard) and Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings). These lucky folks decide that he isn't some wandering drunk and help him on his plight to retrieve his magical hammer. During the relationship with Jane and back in Asgard, Thors brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is able to seize the throne of king as Odin (Anthony Hopkins) falls ill, but does Loki have some ulterior motives here? The movie moves on with a steady hand of extremely well done character development that being helmed by Kenneth Branagh did not surprise me at all. A master of making you believe in the characters is something no one does much better, and in the unbelievable story material he was given, he scores an A+. The scenes in Asgard look absolutely breathtaking, the scenes in the frost kingdom look so dismal you can almost feel the chill, and earth, well, that is just New Mexico, nothing exciting (but some very good camera-work helps here). Of course, there is going to be some exciting action sequences to tide you over, but this movie is really about the acting and chemistry of the cast which is something to appreciate greatly. I only wish they would've given a bit more time to the romance between Thor and Jane (yes, I did just type that). Their love story seemed to be an afterthought swept under the rug to keep the comic book story going. Ultimately this movie, and Marvel studios, again bring out a quality picture about a superhero, but doesn't just use eye candy action to wow the viewer, but uses real emotions to draw the audience into the trials and turmoils that occur. 6.8/10 IMDb 7.0.

While Odin selects Thor to take his place as King of Asgard Loki uncovers a secret that nearly destroys everything. He is not Odin's son. he is in fact the son of the frost giant King. And Loki was taken from a battlefield and raised to be Odin's son. The God of Mischiefwants the throne of Asgard for himself. So he sets a plot in motion to send Thor into Exile and to remove Odin out of his way. Along the way Thor learns his lessons. And Loki decides to take the fight to Earth to get rid of his half brother once and for all. While Thor the Dark World is better in some ways. THOR has the better characterization. It brings Thor very nicely into the MArvel U and helps set up the Avengers in a very nice and very good way. Some claim it's the weakest MArvel movie. Others think it's a insult to the Mrvel U.

","When I was a kid, I was never into Thor type of comics (or any superhero, for that matter). I guess I was waiting for the movies (like Batman, Spiderman, Iron Man, Hulk and others, including this one). It is quite surprising how a teenage ""stimulus for imagination"" can be turned in such fun and entertaining movies for virtually every generation, subtly avoiding the dangers of banality. Thor is almost an excellent movie: non- pretentious, well directed (good job, Mr. Branagh) and carried out in every aspect. The casting is also not bad but it really doesn't matter here. Any combination of actors could do. When you put a good story in good hands (and have a lot of money and enthusiasts to support it), nothing can go wrong. And it didn't. This is what most of the movies should be about: entertainment. Every once in a while such a bulls-eye pops out. And is very well worth watching. Can't wait for the ""part II"".

","While the special effects representing the abode of the Norse gods known as Asgard and the Bifrost bridge are extremely impressive, the storyline is less so. At the start of the story, Thor is depicted as an impulsive, emotional god that must be reigned in by the reigning god, the wise Odin. Thor's behavior is so out of line that Odin banishes him to New Mexico with no godlike powers and without the ability to control his mighty hammer known as Mjolnir,. Although he is still tough as nails and capable of physically defeating nearly all human males, he can still be whipped up on.
When a small team of astronomical researchers encounter the deposed Thor when he is hit by their van, a relationship between them is begun. Thor's mighty hammer also lands near where Thor did, and it defies all attempts by humans to move it. There is a great cameo by Stan Lee in that sequence of actions. A massive team of U. S. government agents (S. H. I. E. L. D.) swarms in and begins the study of the hammer, yet despite the highest of technologies at their disposal, they learn very little about it.
Meanwhile, Thor's brother Loki learns that while Thor is Odin's true offspring, he was in fact adopted by Odin. This leads to a great deal of resentment and Loki engaging in a great deal of underhanded machinations in trying to ascend to the Asgardian throne. Since Thor rekindled the hostilities between the Asgardians and the Frost Giants and they are plotting to recover the source of their power from Asgard, Thor's absence gives the Frost Giants an advantage. Since he is the spawn of the Frost Giants and the Asgardian throne is at stake, Loki does not hesitate to align himself with the leader of the Frost Giants.
The weakness of the movie is that the events on Earth sometimes come across as forced and uncertain. The S. H. I. E. L. D. agents are arrogant, ignoring the laws regarding search and seizure and some of the action scenes are played with needless destruction by the killer robot known as Destroyer.

Its amazing how an adaptation can go so far and actually emulate the kind of imagination the creators actually had for this Character and his universe. I congratulate the Director & all involved in this movie for making it such an awesome experience in the cinema as the visual effects were outstanding & nailed to the core. The story itself was an absolute gem. Yes, we may have stumbled across similar story lines elsewhere. But the writers did a brilliant job to make this their own.

And should go on to claim to be this years greatest blockbuster. DC comics have the new Batman flying its flag. Marvel have, The Iron Man, Thor & possibly Captain America & the Avengers. Its exiting times to be a comic fan, with films like Thor laying a new benchmark in story telling & it could only be justice to us fans to wait for a second Thor movie.

Some moments were meant to be touching or even dramatic, but they were so predictable and cliché they were just very funny. Dialogue (okay, maybe not literally but still pretty much): ""Oh dad, I just wanted to make you proud!"" ""Oh son you already have!"" Drama moment: Natalie Portman running in slow motion to Thor as he dies. Drama, drama. * The plot didn't make any sense. Okay, so Loki hated his brother (or was at least psycho jealous). Why?! No part of the movie even hints at this in their childhood! Thor was arrogant and violent in the beginning and then overnight he's this great guy who sacrifices himself for others? Jane (played by Natalie Portman) suddenly re-deciding on giving Thor a ride? Why? * Some parts made even less sense than the parts that didn't make any sense: Thor making toast with egg. Yeah, I'm sure they had a lot of experience with that in Asgard. Thor suddenly getting his hammer back. Okay, that was cheesy, but why was he alive again anyway?

","Thor is about the god of thunder trying to get back to Asgard after being banished to earth for starting a war. In the movie, his brother Loki tries to take the throne os Asgard and to destroy his brother and a species of ice monsters.
This fun, adventurous, visually appealing and surprisingly deep film is perfect for kids and adults alike. The advantage of this movie is its cast. Chris Hemsworth is great as Thor, and the legendary Anthony Hopkins is notably good at playing the Allfather Odin, Thor's father. Also another advantage is the story and the messages that it offered. When Thor becomes the king, his behavior in this period is not wise and boyish and because of that his father sends him to our land. However, in the end he realizes that to be king he must be wise and prevent war. He learns his lesson by almost getting killed to protect the ones he loves. This message can have a strong impact on the viewer's mind and we can learn a lot. The disadvantage is its love story. The romance falls short and far too rushed with Natalie Portman's Jane Foster character. However, because it is an action and it is more about the battles and saving the world, it can be forgiven.
All in all, an action-packed adventure with amazing special effects and some romance makes this a good family movie.",/review/rw2429213/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_(2011

","It was a somewhat entertaining movie. Great CGI, you can really tell Marvel did their best with this one. First off is the characters. Thor is quite funny to watch when he's turned human, as he thinks he's invincible, and ...he's not. Loki was a bit weird. I wasn't sure what they were trying to do with his character. I've seen some down right wacky Loki's over the years, but this one was just bland and boring. It's like they were trying to make a good villain for the movie, but then changed their minds half way through, and making Loki a ""frost giant"" was just pointless. Honestly, there's really not much as far as villains go in this movie. Sure there's the frost giants, but they're just there. They want to conquer Asgard,but then there's the big ""Why?"" because someone like Thor can just go Rambo and kill their entire species. Moving on to Jane. She's your basic stereo-type female scientist, not much to say. She's completely average as far as characters go. Thor's merry men were no better. There's the samurai- looking guy, Xena the warrior princess, a guy that looks like a tall dwarf from the Lord of the Rings, and a blond guy. They're as pointless as the frost giants. Overall, the movie has beautiful CGI, and not much else. Also, I have to add, Thor is just too powerful to really work as an effective hero. Hercules, for example, was a human with god-like strength. Thor is a god, with god-like strength. It doesn't really work, since he doesn't have any krytonite or any weaknesses like that. The worst a villain can do is threaten or kill his loved ones.

698,24 July 2019,blackwidowis7cool,10," Suprisingly enjoyable
","Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is an alien humanoid, for lack of better terminology. He is a prince on the planet Asgard, son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins), the ruler of Asgard, and brother of Loki (Tom Hiddleston - did I spell his surname correctly?).
I started watching this movie with great trepidation as I'm not big on aliens, so wasn't sure how this movie would go.
I was pleasantly surprised to find that it's an excellent movie!
There is some violence, but it's actually pretty tame compared to other films. In fact, there was hardly any violence at all.
There is plenty of humour and Thor is actually a rather light, family-friendly film. There is plenty of twists and turns and it's a mixture of science and fantasy with no clear distinction between the two. In the movie, science and ""magic"" are one and the same. And I actually enjoyed that perspective. It's not really magic as such - more odd forms of superior technology on the part of the Asgardians. There's different alien colonies - the Asgardians who resemble humans and are the good guys who help Earth out. Then there's the Forest Giants - the evil alien life forms.
There are others, but we don't see them and their names are not mentioned.
In the movie Thor, the filmmakers drew a lot from the legends from Norse mythology and made it into an enjoyable sci-fi movie.
The animation is really great! Especially with the shots we see of Asgard. This film is a visual splendor.
There is plenty of exciting action scenes that are somewhat preposterous at times, but they are a lot of fun and enjoyable.
Chris Hemsworth is a marvelous actor! He is really good at bringing his character to life. He portrays the arrogant, reckless, self-righteous guy really well. When Thor ends up on Earth, he is a real fish out of water. Hemsworth does it excellently and I was laughing so hard watching Thor trying to understand Earth and the way we do things.
Tom Hiddleston is great as Loki, Thor's adoptive brother and the villain of the movie. He is very likeable despite having evil intentions. Loki is a very complicated character and there's more to him than meets the eye. Hiddleston does his role excellently.
Natalie Portman is great as Jane, a scientist and Thor's love interest. She does the socially awkward scientist role really well. Idris Elba is awesome and can be quite comic at times and is a great actor. Ray Stevenson is good and provides lots of comic relief. I really liked how the Asgardians, while technologically superior to us humans, talk old style and dress like ancient warriors. It provided lots of laughs.
Anthony Hopkins is great as Odin, Thor and Loki's father and the old wise king. I also love the romantic subplot between Jane and Thor. It was handled very well.
You could argue that some parts are cheesy and cliched. While that might possibly be true, it's an enjoyable cheesy. It's still a lot of fun and I love the 'cheesy' parts - they are handled very well. This certainly isn't a film for everybody. Not everyone will like it and that's okay. That's them and their tastes and preferences. But this is me and my tastes and preferences. I love it. You may not and that's totally fine as well. We're all different.
It's a really great movie with a great and relevant message. Plenty of twists and turns and has great character development. Everything is handled marvellously. It is well-written and well executed. I totally enjoy this movie - it's not meant to be realistic, just a lot of fun and excitement. Great animation, great acting.

","I'm a great fan of superhero movies and I always go out and watch them on the big screen.

Though Thor is not as famous as Spiderman, Bat man, and I don't recall reading the comic, he is a Nordic God, so that makes him pretty big in the scheme of things right? As it shifts back and forth between earth and Thor's planet in another constellation, the movie uses 3D to great effect, much better than I've seen it used in recent movies like Tron. Chris Hensworth, last seen in The Perfect Getaway, makes for an charmingly adorable Norse God and Anthony Hopkins lends great presence in the role of his father, Odin. Shakespearean actor/director Kenneth Branagh adds lots of theatrical floorish to the proceedings, especially in the relationship between Odin and his two sons. The talented women in this film, Natalie Portman (Thor's would-be lady love), Rene Rousso (thor's mother), don't have much to do. Very little time is given to the romance between Thor and earthling scientist and I think it could possibly have been dispensed with totally (a movie without a love angle? why not?). The running theme of the movie is that good kings (and good superheroes) never incite wars, though they must be prepared for it when there is no other course of action.

","Thor is easily one of marvels hardest properties to bring to the big screen and could have turned out for the worst with being received as corny, cheesy, or just too hard to understand, but leave it to the folks at marvel to get it right. After seeing this movie having to know nothing about Thor, I have to say this is the best marvel film yet and was told in the best way possible that a story like this could be told. The people behind the making of this film do a great job of taking the source material of the comic and reshaping it enough that it stays true to the comic, but also making it have a sense of realism to it so that the audience can relate to it. They make the actors feel like GODS when they need to, but sprinkle a bit of emotion that makes them feel human in a way. The director does a great job with what is given to him and does a good job of making the audience believe what is going on during the movie (jumping from different universes and such). The pacing of the movie adds a little extra to the story line because it gives away small doses of who these characters are and the world they are from so the viewer won't be blown away with all the things being portrayed. The production team really ups the bar with the amount of sci fiction this film has over the ground things we are accustom to seeing. They did this so well that it has the feel of a star wars movie with the whole travel the universe in a way with a dash of lord of rings attributes because of the present mid age vibe and the two element blend very well to creature the genre of film. I also have to say the acting from the characters in this movie were a lot better than performances people put on it passed marvel film or many other film in general. Every person does an amazing great at the role given to them; whether they had little screen time or a major role to play. Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston do an amazing job portraying these two iconic characters and bring them to life. With both actors never really having a big role in a movie before they command their screen time very well and give a break out performances. Also Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman do a great job as always making it easy I'm sure for the first time actors. The director captures the audience also with some of the best visual CGI that I have seen in many movies that it is front lining the visual displayed in Avatar. This film has a lot of funny lines drop throughout it that makes it feel very relaxed at times where it could of felt kind of forced and misplaced. On top of that it has fresh story that was well written and not polluted with dull moments that could draw away from what's going on in the film.

","Thor was definitely one of the films in the MCU that helped kick off for what was to come. It has a great story, good characters, and a great character arc for the start of the character Thor. Chris Hemsworth is great in his first outing as Thor and what I love about his portrayal here the most is what he has to go through in this film with learning not only just how to become a responsible leader and by having his powers stripped away from him, but also what it means to protect the innocent and what it really means to be worthy. Tom Hiddleston was literally born to play Loki and it was hard to believe he was almost casted as Thor, but I was so glad they didn't and I think Tom is too. He owns this role in every way possible by being not just charming, but very menacing when it's needed the most. Anthony Hopkins as Odin was a dream casting come true as the king and current ruler of Asgard and is definitely one of the most perfect castings in the MCU. Natalie Portman as Astrophysicist Dr. Jane Foster is fantastic and probably my one of my favorite female characters to come to the MCU. Idris Elba as Heimdall is the wisest character of all in the film and one of the standouts that I wished we would of gotten just a little more of in this film. My only cons in this film really are I guess the frost giants could of been just a bit better as I felt they were some of the weakest villains ever in the MCU and how Chris Hemsworth's Thor's eyebrows were a little blonder than they should of been.

","It would have been easy for the fourth entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to collapse in a heap of silliness: the elaborate costumes; the extravagant playland that is Asgard (which somewhat resembles the Emerald City); the complicated retelling of Norse mythology. You need actors with the weight and seriousness of Anthony Hopkins and Idris Elba just to bring off the headgear. But this film has everything it needs to hold itself up and extra to boot. Rene Russo, for example, doesn't have nearly enough to do as Thor's mother. Director Kenneth Branagh and his small army of screenplay and story writers structure this as a basic hero's journey, mining culture and legend for little tropes that fit nicely. Thor's gang-of-five recall Robin Hood's Merry Men, except that here one is Jamie Alexander as the fiercely capable Lady Sith. Resonances with some of Shakespeare's history plays are interwoven without being too pointed. Unlike with Marvel's previous two entries, here the characters who remind everyone that ""The Avengers"" is coming aren't distractingly shoehorned in. Mostly, no one forgets to have fun with all this, especially not Chris Hemsworth in the deceptively simple title role. Not only does he look every bit the Man-God he's supposed to be, he hits all the emotional marks the story throws his way with the right mix of humor, arrogance and sincerity, and plays well off the other actors. The film's secret weapon is Tom Hiddleston's Loki, easily Marvel's best villain to date, who connives and deceives with the wit and aplomb you'd expect from a legendary trickster. Hiddleston manages the complicated feat of making Loki both fun to watch and someone to be wary of because of his unpredictability.

","I will not attempt to defend this movie as an art film; it does not provide insightful reflection upon the human condition. And it is completely preposterous in every way. However, it is fun from start to finish, true ""escapism."" The characters are thin as some critics have charged, but they serve their archetypal purposes. Thor is a foolish, cocky kid who ""grows up"" fast. Loki, like his namesake in Norse mythology, is evil and pitiful at the same time so in that sense not just ""evil incarnate"" like your average superhero villain. The scientist-Valley Girl lacks credibility as a character, but Natalie Portman lends the role some sincerity and gravitas. Speaking of gravitas, the gate-keeper played by the always splendid Idris Elba worked quite well in that role. Some have complained about the phoniness of the sets in the small town, and I admit at times I kept thinking ""this is a set,"" but it didn't get in the way - it came across more as an homage to cheesy 50s sci fi flicks in which the action always manages to take place in an obscure desert town. Some of the special effects were overdone and hard to follow (i..e who's pounding whom, and with what weapon?) and looked like CGI, but the whole fairy-tale aspect of it meant that if some of the landscapes looked more dream-like than real, that was okay too. The storyline is beside the point - Will Odin survive? will Thor prevail? Will Loki's lies be exposed? Do you even have to ask? You know from the beginning how it turns out but that does not spoil the fun along the way.",/review/rw2429213/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_(2011

","The hammer-wielding and good-looking Thor in his first adventure in the MCU. Director Branagh passionately takes over the narrative style, from this comic book template. You can already see, however, that Branagh is a big Shakespeare fan. Almost monumental, he draws the figures of Thor, Odin or Loki. The city of Asgard is also more likely to come from Hamlet than Marvel. The story tells Branagh well and he also incorporates a lot of humour. For when Thor falls to earth, he has already lost the power of a God. It's not until the second half of the film that stands out. Therefore, it is amusing that the arrogant and beautiful Thor himself falls on the snout and remains equally entitled. Of course, Thor is the hero, so you have to disguise it that he is the same as a human being. He can still fight better and has more strength than three people combined.
In addition to Hemsworth as Thor, there are other confessed performers to his side. Natalie Portman gives the typical, chaotic scientist. While she's a bit cranky, she makes her likeable alongside the overpowering heroes. Stellan Skaarsgard is an old professor who is more than a father figure to Portman. And, of course, Anthony Hopkins as Konigsgott Odin, who still brings a bit of sparkle to this hero saga. Narratively and visually, Branagh has managed not to straddle the adventure on torture for long. You look at it to the performers, which was fun.

So it was with some trepidation that I went to see it. These are our gods, after all.

The movie does have some amazing special effects, artwork and sets, but it moves from one scene to the next, vacillating between amazing heroic scenes on Thor's planet of Asgard vs scenes of complete dorkiness with Natalie Portman.

","Thor Where do I start with this overly hyped messy Marvel hero story. Well he is one of the lesser known Marvel characters for the non fan boy geeks out there. But for most comic fans he is well known but mostly loved when part of the ensemble Avengers or Ultimates comic line. His own comic line of Thor (standalone) never sold well and was never really resonating well in the Marvel Universe on his own simply because we're talking about a super being with God like powers. The thing people love about the Marvel Universe especially comic fans and young kids is the believability factor. Spiderman walks the streets of New York, he's a teenage boy with problems other teenage boys can relate too. Iron man is a cocky business man with millions of dollars in wealth like a flash Bill gates & Steve Jobs rolled into one ! Even the far out characters in the Xmen you can relate with because they are treated differently due to their difference all be it massively magical mutations. But with Thor you need a Marvel loving audience to relate with viking costumes, Asgard & Yodenheim and the 9 realms. Make any sense? I bet not! I'm sorry but this sounds more like a cross between a bad Star Trek story and Lord of the Rings gone wrong! The best thing about Thor is when he is on Earth. I know we all have to learn about the origins of these characters. But the in this film we learn about Thor's world, Asgard, his relationship with his brother & father and the main realm they have a beef with, Yoddenheim. Most if it is unnecessary. They could have just continued the story from the point that Thor is banished to Earth for defying his father. Instead just as you get comfortable with Thor being like a fish out of water on earth and start enjoying the jokes of his clumsy mannerisms with the human people they take him back to Asgard where he becomes trapped ! BORING !! The best bits for me in this movie were the mentions of Bruce Banner, Tony Stark. Appearance of Hawkeye and the post credits scene with Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson again). I know I sound like a crazy angry fan boy geek gone mad. I understand all these movies like Iron Man 1 & 2 & Incredible Hulk and the soon to be released Captain America are there to setup The Avengers movie next year. But this movie could and should have been so more..massive disappointment due to the story being central to the world of Asgaard. Watch it if you don't know much about Thor and ain't expecting anything but some action and a fantastically other world storyline + its definitely not for 3D so save yourself some money by just watching in 2D it was never made for 3D - Although the Captain America Trail in 3D looked amazing!

837,20 April 2020,frostyfrog,5," Thor
","Thor is a film directed by Kenneth Branagh that stars Chris Hemsworth, Anthony Hopkins, Natalie Portman and Tom Hiddelston and tells the story of Thor, an Asgardian prince who is cast out of Asgard and forced to live on Earth and learn humility. I was very excited for the Thor film as a kid, I loved watching him on ""Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes"" (a great show that I recommend the kids watch on Disney plus) and when I heard they were making a Thor film, I bought a magazine that went in depth on the making of the film and I was Thor for Halloween that year. Watching it as a kid, I remembered enjoying it pretty well and I was excited to see him team up with the other Avengers, once the epic team up was released. Rewatching Thor very recently, I have to say that it was still a solid watch. I like Chris Hemsworth as Thor in this, he's as believably arrogant as he is badass in a fight and as I'll touch on in later reviews, I like the evolution of Thor as a character throughout the MCU films. Hell, I even enjoyed Thor's evolution as a character in this as he learned humility and attempted to right his wrongs with his family, it was nicely done. I also enjoyed the fish out of water element in that Thor had to adjust to life on Earth like the coffee cup smashing scene or the ""Give me on of those large enough to ride"" line at the pet store. Natalie Portman did a decent job as Jane Foster and her friends portrayed by Kat Jennings and Stella Skarsgård felt very realistic. This is a bit of a side note but Skarsgård in particular has a scene in an MCU film I'll be reviewing later that is downright hilarious so stay tuned for that. Tom Hiddelston was brilliant as Loki and to this day is arguably the best villain the MCU has to offer. I loved seeing the effect that being Thor's little brother had on Loki and how his upbringing made him feel like an outsider as it really pulled you into his character. His plan in this film was sketchy but I'll get into that a bit later. I've liked Anthony Hopkins in just about every role I've seen him portray but as Odin, he really shines as a wise but powerful aging god. The action sequences in this film were pretty fun as well, be it the opening scene where Thor and his friends take on frost giants or the fight on the Rainbow Bridge at the end. I think the film's highlight action sequence was the fight between Thor and the Destroyer though. I also enjoyed some of the energy brought to the film from director Kenneth Branagh, who is very experienced in filmmaking of the Shakespeare variety. There were a few things in this film that I didn't like as well. I didn't find the Frost Giants or Thor's friends known as the Warriors Three to be particularly memorable. The Frost Giants being cold (pun intended) emotionless beings whose sole motivation is to attack Asgard due to their history and grudge against Odin. The Warriors Three basically each having a character trait and consistently sticking to it throughout the course of the film. I honestly completely forgot about the Frost Giants until I re-watched this and forgot about the Warriors Three until Thor Ragnarok but that's for later. Loki's plan in the film was incredibly convoluted and didn't make much sense to me. The first few things he did made sense don't get me wrong but afterwards it felt like he overcomplicated what should've been an easy task. The film has him strive for the affection of Odin in the end and his birthright as prince of Asgard but in reality I think the film could've been more effective if it went in the opposite direction. I would've loved to see Loki try to concoct a plan like he did in Earth's Mightiest Heroes because it made way more sense than this films version of the character. The effects in this film were okay but they really haven't aged well. All of the metal in the film whether it's Asgard, the Destroyer or weapons and armor seemed overly chromatic at times and it was distracting. Speaking of distractions, I'm not sure how many of you guys have heard that the main critique of this film is the over-use of the Dutch angle, where the camera is tilted fourty-five degrees to start the scene. I'm only mentioning this because I'm pretty sure every scene in the film starts like this and admittedly it gets pretty annoying after awhile. SHIELD makes yet another appearance in a long line of them here and while it is important to the plot this time it also takes a decent amount of time to set up Hawkeye, the Tesseract and Captain America both for the film and for the Avengers. I do like seeing Phil Coulson though as Clarke Gregg is a treat no matter where he appeared be it in agents of Shield or the Avengers. It just felt to me like Thor suffers for being a stepping stone to the Avengers in the same sense that Iron Man 2 did in that it can't fully establish itself as a film because it has to set up future films. If it took more time to build on the lore of the Frost Giants and the Asgardians aside from that opening sequence or maybe even establish other Asgardians aside from Thor, Loki, Odin and Heimdall as complex characters, you might be talking about one of the better Marvel films out there. I definitely feel this film could've benefitted more by establishing Asgard more as a location and by people more so than those Earth in both regards. Still though, even with the same weaknesses as Iron Man 2 though it was a bit more enjoyable and I definitely didn't mind it as a film at all. I think if you go back and rewatch it, you'll actually see that it was decent.",/review/rw2429213/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_(2011

","This movie was entertaining and nailed Thor's introduction. He starts of as an ignorant, naive, warmongering god that wishes to muscle his way through his rule as king. However, this does happen to the manipulating of Loki. Loki is such a great character because there are times where you can tell he is a lonely figure wanting to prove himself and in a life crisis due to betrayal but then there are times where he is just manipulating everyone. And on top of this, there are times where you can't tell which. Is he being real or fake? This makes every one of his scenes interesting. Hemsworth, Hiddleston, and Hopkins all nail their roles. The dynamic between these three are great and the movie. The movie is simple with emotions, like betrayal and impulse, driving it. The best moments are those of breakthrough of character development. Thor finding his worthiness again is the climax the movie was really leading towards. And the fight with the destroyer was quick but epic. He then goes home to find that Loki hasn't killed Odin but made another attempt to please him. And you can tell both brother care for each other but must fight. Loki is what Thor was at the beginning, showing that he must of looked up to Thor in some ways. The reason he sent the destroyer after Thor was because thor was the only obstacle from having everything he wanted. He didn't do it out of hatred.

Loki was a very interesting character, and instead of your stereotypical trickster, Loki actually had some depth to his character, and some very real issues. Rene Russo was a stealth goddess. I kept saying to myself ""Where have I seen her before?"" I was actually skeptical about Branagh directing, but he did an admirable job. Stellan Skarsgaard was interesting and subdued; he had one of the best lines: ""I don't know if you're really the Thunder God, but if you're not, you should be!"" **Edit** I agree with other reviewers about Idris Elba as Heimdall. Great character, and handled perfectly in character. A minor spoiler: Keep an eye out for the god of all gods, Stan Lee, making his obligatory cameo as the driver of a pickup truck.

The main problem I have is with the main battle sequence that should have been the highlight of the whole movie and I guess it was but it really should have been a lot bigger and better, in the comic it was just mindblowing but it did not translate it to the big screen very well, it was not as action packed or mind blowing. The acting was pretty good for a movie like this. A lot of people thought it was stupid but I think this movie is intended more for fans of the comic like me, if you aren't familiar with the comic you will probably just think it is stupid, but why go see it if you think Thor is stupid anyway?",/review/rw2429213/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_(2011

The film was OK but I'm wondering if I'm just becoming more discerning or jilted in my older age (this film is certainly no 8 rating), granted I'm only 25. For the film tried to move way too fast since it is covering so much material in two hours. In that sense I felt like more could have been done on character development and background but due to the massive amount of material it decided to go the typical Hollywood comic book adaption route, lets cram it all in! That aside the story was fairly cohesive and there didn't seem to be any glaring gaps or horribly inexplicable scenes, some small things perhaps but nothing were I felt it was just an atrocity. The actors were all solid. Which was one of the things that drew me. All of them performed the roles well but once again the largest failing was the writing. Sadly I feel people who adapt these films by and large, although there are exceptions (iron man, x men, watchmen), are trying to appeal to a lowest common denominator. Which financially is sound but for people who like good movies it is a bit of a let down. I'm no comic geek but I know that most comic geeks have very mixed feelings on most of these films. They are happy they came to light and brought new fans but are also disappointed about the loss of nuance. Ultimately after all is said and done it was good light fun for an afternoon but I doubt I'll ever see it again. I'm more looking forward to Captain America, Avengers, and Green Hornet.

I probably wouldn't recommend it for ages under 10, some scary stuff like how the destroyer threw Thor and he was pretty bloody, it can also be kinda violent, like the anger that Odin used to yell at Thor, gives off a bad vibe, and the cameos are hilarious, like the billboard saying Journey into mystery, a reference to Thor's first comic appearance.

","Great Odins Raven where to begin. I like comics. I like superheroes. While I consider myself more of a DC guy (especially Green Lantern and Superman), I have loved every installment as Marvel builds towards next summer's ""The Avengers"" (yes, I even loved ""The Hulk""). But Thor was just flat. I had doubts from the beginning. How was a mythical Viking God supposed to fit in with the universe that gave us Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark? The answer? Not very well actually. Thor was riddled with Oscar winners, but it could not escape the average narrative. The costume looked much better than I expected, but the rest of Asgard felt like a soulless video game back drop. The CGI was so over the top that it became distracting (and actually made me begin to worry about The Green Lantern). Chris Hemsworth was very solid playing the lead. But the movies biggest flaws were with Anthony Hopkins as Odin and Natalie Portman as Jane Foster. Now you would expect 2 such great actors to knock these type of rolls out of the park. Instead, both struggled to maintain competence. Hopkins gave a mail- it-in performance on par with Jack Nickolson in the Departed. Every time he was on screen I found myself begging for it to end. Portman acquitted herself slightly better. i would say she was on par with Kirstin Dunst and her Mary Jane Watson chops from Spiderman. Obviously thats still pretty terrible. Sometimes a character just doesn't translate to film. I think Thor is that character. Cinema has struggled with the portrayal of these God-Like comic characters (see: Superman, All of them), for some reason no one has perfected a way to ground them to a reality based environment. Thor is not a character that lacks nuance. But his abilities do. This is literally a God who crushes all with his hammer. It just didn't work.

This makes the movie very easy to get into. Only rarely do you get pulled out due to forced melodrama. The movie achieves nearly everything it sets out to. However, that is the main issue with the film. It isn't exactly ambitious. It does a good job telling a simple superhero origin story, but it does little more than that. Asgard seems to be to be very interesting, but more time spent exploring it would have improved the film.

To me personally, the first ""Thor"" seemed boring, but at the same time interesting. The plot and motivation of the characters spelled out very well, but otherwise the film is very lame. Asgard is drawn very poorly, I can not believe that you see a real huge world. Also extremely crumpled redemption and awareness of the Thor, as well as too spontaneous development of the relationship with Jane Foster. Very weak, though not bad, villain. Let's go through the characters.
Thor (Chris Hemsworth) played well. He is arrogant, arrogant and proud, as befits an almost omnipotent God. But, suddenly deprived of his strength in the face of danger because of his ego, he gradually re-educates himself, finds his love and proves the right to be worthy of his strength.
Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is a controversial character for me. On the one hand, I really like Natalie as an actress. On the other, the character does not cling, and the relationship with Thor, as I said, it's too spontaneous.
Chief, for me, plus this movie-Loki (Tom Hiddleston). He's very motivated. He had a little envy for my brother, so it is also One lied to all my life! And although his plan to seize power in Asgard, to put it mildly, strange, charisma and great game Tom cover everything.

Why is the entire army on maneuvers in front of the castle? They couldn't have known Loki was opening a hole in the good guy/bad guy space time continuum...)

Where most of Marvel's superhero movies basically is like watching a WWF match. Pretty much staged and dramatised action. In Thor, although you do get action, it played a supporting role to the story line. The whole movie revolved around siblings who just want to impress their father. The fact that anyone could be pushed to the brink just to see the glimmer of acceptance and pride in the eyes of the people that they love, can be related to just about everybody. The emotional journey from a brother who realised what his ignorance has cost him to a brother who struggles to stand alone and be accepted and appreciate, all was played perfectly by Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston.

","Thor is often considered to be a weak MCU film, a bad MCU film. But it's better than people remember. This film does a lot of worldbuilding and is very good at it; it introduces Asgard, the first non-Earth location, and many characters who would go on to appear in many films. Thor, Loki, Odin, Jane, etc. The Earth characters act as a great contrast to the Asgardians. You'd think it would be a bit of tonal whiplash, but due to the film introducing the Earth characters in the first scene, then coming back to them later, makes it more natural. The highlights when it comes to characters are Anthony Hopkins' well-delivered performance of Odin, Kat Dennings' funny performance of Darcy, and of course, Tom Hiddleston as Loki. However, the Warriors Three aren't exactly the most necessary characters, and very easily could be removed. Laufey is a very forgettable villain, and even our protagonist could've maybe been better. I'd say the main problem with Thor in this film is we don't even see his powers for 75% of the film. I understand they wanted to make the film about Thor learning humility, but making a fish out of water story is difficult when we've never even seen the fish in the water. Other than that, he's pretty good. Chris Hemsworth is able to do the dramatic scenes and, as Ragnarok would later prove, is great at comedy. The special effects are pretty good, though not as good as the Iron Man films, the set design is impeccable on Asgard, and I consider the soundtrack to be extremely underrated.

","I've always been cautious about watching superhero movies, knowing full well that their loyal fan base laud the movie for being something better than what it is. Having read numerous positive reviews on the newspaper (I'm sorry now that I didn't check IMDb first) I decided that Thor seemed like a good choice to spend a lazy afternoon watching. Oh how wrong I was. Even for a superhero action movie, the character development was utterly pitiful and the actors, well I honestly don't know what they were doing there. Anthony Hopkins was the only noteworthy performance, yet I expected nothing less than him. The film spends an excruciating 45-55 minutes or so explaining the background and lore of this universe yet fails depict Thor's transformation from an arrogant meat-head, into some chivalrous gentleman, in a remotely believable manner I mean, really? 2 to 3 Days? He's a the future King of Asgard for god-sake, not a faithless call girl. As a matter of fact, Loki seems a far more likable and relatable character. He is responsible(mostly), wise, and portrayed as rather a love deprived delinquent, remotely malignant and the very least jealous character, as opposed than the self-righteous, prototypical pretty boy, Thor. While the idea of an ambiguous antagonist may be acceptable in art-house cinema, it should be painfully obvious who the villain is in a superhero movie. Obviously there should be motives to each character in a film yet, it seems Loki is much more believable than the inexplicably shifting character of Thor, who based on such seeming unjustified monumental moral shifts, one really wonders whether Loki was right in taking over as king. Honestly, all the humans, serve little to no purpose plot wise, what so ever, one must wonder why is a big name like Natalie Portman chosen to play such a puny meaningless moronic love interest role (Oh thats right, she a box office grabbing machine), let alone why do these powerful beings want anything to do with our bland Earth at all. The frequent long distance traveling that occurs in this film and the fact that it occurs equally and confoundingly in 3 separate dimensions of the ""Yggdrasil"" does nothing for the films story telling if not, detracting focus. However they do present wonderful opportunities for spectacular CGI environments and sequences(which by now are something of a standard in such films), which singularly constitute the 2 stars out of 10, the other being Anthony Hopkins who has and always be are ""stellar"" performance.

The beginning seems to rush through, and has some over-selling of some parts (like the shot of Mjolnir in the hallway, I mean really who leaves one of their most powerful weapons just lying around?), and Kat Dennings' character seems to be dead weight that's full of irritating writing. But once the story finds it's footing, it's a fun one to watch. Two different but connected plots, one following Thor on earth, learning to live in our culture and in a way, coming of age, another on Asgard, following Loki's revelation and betrayal, come crashing back together at the end of the film, and it's marvelous (excuse the pun) to see how both Thor and his brother have grown as characters.

I liked the only real action scene in the movie, which was where Thor gets into the fight with the Big metal dude. Other than that, there was very little real action. I cant wait until comic book movies get more gruesome. I think they should take Venom out of the Spiderman series and make a movie about him.",/review/rw2429213/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_(2011

","Thor is not a masterpiece, and if you go in expecting anything more than cheesy action, pretty faces, and great production, you will be disappointed. However, if you go in expecting to be entertained for two hours and not be grossed out, offended, depressed, or bored, you'll get that. The main actor is good, the side characters are tolerable, the plot is easy to follow but pretty much sticks to the source material (not being a comic reader--my comic buff fiancée watched it and wasn't distressed by any changes), the CGI is really nice, especially for the city of Asgard, and the sound is fantastic, it's really realistic and has a strong impact without actually being loud. There's the general swords and sorcery battling, but no gore, no sex, no real violence or scary scenes, it's just good clean cool-guy-with- powers-doing-cool-stuff and the scenes in the human world are actually quite amusing without being painfully awkward or overdone.",/review/rw2429213/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_(2011

I didn't like how basically the first half of the movie all takes place in Asgard. I wish they would have had more of the movie on Earth. It did a good job of developing Loki in the movie, but not really developing Thor. He kind of just changed over night, nothing really happened to provoke that change. I also wish we would have seen Hawkeye in costume, most people probably didn't even know that Jeremy Rener is Hawkeye in the film and I would have liked to have seen him for more then 2 mins.

1022,21 May 2011,meredithkennedy66,6," Great special effects don't quite fill in the blanks SPOILER ALERT
","As we left the theatre after seeing THOR, my dad remarked 'Gee, Anthony Hopkins must have really needed the work.' It was really the script that needed work. It ought to be a federal offense to cast a heavy-hitter like Anthony Hopkins and not give him the material to display his special magic – the nuance, depth and subtlety of which he is so capable (think 'Fracture' and 'Proof'), and which keeps him in my Top Ten list of all-time best actors. Just goes to show you that not even brilliant actors can save a mediocre script, although Hopkins (as Odin), Tom Hiddleston (as Loki), Idris Elba (as Heimdall the Gatekeeper), and Kat Dennings (as Darcy Lewis) excelled in their own roles. Chris Hemsworth's brash and testosterone-pickled Thor was kind of one-dimensional for the first hour (and when things got a little bogged down he took off his shirt, which helped with the tedium!), but his character gained momentum in the second half where the script finally allowed him to get some depth and emotion besides the football/caveman/kill da wabbit outlook, and he rose to the challenge very well. (Now, if we could see him do this kind of interesting acting without his shirt too, whew!). Unfortunately, just as Thor's character was becoming interesting, he got streamlined into a very predictable and ho-hum love story with Natalie Portman's Jane Foster; another underutilized talent, as was Rene Russo's Queen Frigga. All very talented actors who just didn't have enough material to make it fly. While I usually love director Kenneth Branagh's quirky, grandiose, no-holds-barred creative genius, for this film the multitude of dimensions, worlds and historical scope proved too much for one feature-length, and the stellar special effects were not enough to fill in the blanks of this story and keep it from fragmenting into tedium.

This movie in my opinion should try to be along with Clash of the Titans. A lot of action, some violence in the fight scenes to make them look a little better. Then again the main reason a movie can be redeemed as good is by having a great story line. I hope to see them focus a bit on the actual mythology of Thor, teach you a little bit about him. Some movies tend to skip the most important thing which is telling the audience Thor is a god, how he came to be, what his purpose is, and what exactly he is fighting for and why Thor for that particular reason.

And the emotion about losing his father and family was believable. And I also enjoyed the portrayal of bratty 3 yr old type behavior as well... :-) So the transition when Thor finally learns his lesson was effective for me.

I honestly thought that Thor was going to exceed all expectations of what superhero movies can do. It was to be an epic movie with a colorful cast. Well it did have a colorful cast with a not so colorful story. I believe Thor is the best argument one can use against the fanboys to say: ""The original story can't always be as rigid as the comics."" To me, it felt like there was not a whole lot of life in the movie. Asgard felt like an empty shell only harboring a handful of characters. Where was the Asgardian civilization? Where was the turmoil in the streets when the Frost Giants attacked? That's my argument on the Asgardian side of things. On the Earth side of things. Why on earth (no pun intended) did Thor have to be cast down into New Mexico? which brings me to my next question: why did he stay in New Mexico? I mean, SHIELD agents are supposed to be on top of things, they should have taken Thor to New York to the SHIELD head quarters where the Destroyer could have come and caused panic in the streets which would have been true mischief worthy of Loki God of Mischief.",/review/rw2429213/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_(2011

1043,23 July 2011,touristonlinereporter,4," Thor, a Victory in Box Office, a Failure for a Director
","The most important motive of an epic story is the conflict between protagonists or heroes. Particularly when the story is related to the ancient gods, we are sure that there should be a big conflict between the two sides of challenge; good and evil. As Thor begins, Frost Giants attack earth and transform men to frozen statues, but men are not alone. Odin a major god and the ruler of Asgard comes to earth and defeats Frost Giants. By here, we are watching a movie that its main conflict is between gods and Frost Giants. Of course due to taking the main source of Frost Giants by Odin, one side of conflict seems too weak and the story should find another motivation. Thor and Loki are two sons of Odin. Thor is strong and brave, but Loki is slim and smart. As the movie goes on, we get sure that the conflict will move to brothers' competition for kingdom and very soon it shows us that Thor is the hero and Loki, the villain. The problem is the inequality of their capabilities. Thor is a strong handsome mythic warrior and Loki looks like a gay guy of modern era. So we can't believe their competition for the kingdom. Then Odin exiles Thor to earth and divests all his powers to be a simple man. Odin goes into some kind of coma and Loki gets the kingdom. But the brothers are not still equal in our minds and they are in two different world. We hope to see a conflict like the one between Commodus and Maximus in Gladiator (Ridley Scott); where the two challengers look equal by their positions, powers and limitations. Troy (Wolfgang Petersen) is another movie we can compare it to Thor. In Troy, a supernatural hero like Achilles has a human character. He can love, he can hate and so when he sacrifices himself for his loved one, we believe and feel it. But when Thor is on earth, we see just a handsome wrestler who has no idea of what he is going to do. He tells nothing to us about his feelings and we feel no sympathy for him. He has a constant character and even his sacrifice is due to his nature as a god who should help human kinds. What happens on the earth is more disappointing. Thor is neither an alien from another planet, nor a confused lost man. He adapts the new circumstances very fast and before we know these men and women around him, he falls in love with one of them. That is not a sweet love as we saw in ""Meet Joe Black"", when Brad Pitt played as death and made love with Claire Forlani. In the same way, when Thor sacrifices himself to save his human friends, it doesn't hurt us. Even Natalie Portman can't save this scene of the movie, when a ridiculous iron giant nearly kills Thor. I think all of these failures refer to the story and screenplay, where there is no characterization for heroes, villains and men. The movie spends a lot of time for action scenes, so it doesn't have enough time to pay to the characters. Thor is a god that his behaviors are predictable, as Odin. Jane, her father and friend are just some shadows around Thor. We know nothing about them, even about their researches. Worse than all, are the governmental guys who have just cars and cloths of secret agents, but their actions are just like cops in animations. Anyway, the Norse Gods, Frost Giants and the story are just some elements for making an action movie. But the strangest thing in the movie is the name of Kenneth Branagh as the director; a veteran Shakespearian who has been nominated in Oscar for his magnificent works in Henry V (1989) and Hamlet (1996). Thor could be made by a director like Zack Snyder who doesn't know anything about the myth and history, not by Branagh who is famous to be loyal to plays or creative in adaptations of them to movies. Thor may be a victory in box office, but surely it is a failure for the director.",/review/rw2429213/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_(2011
