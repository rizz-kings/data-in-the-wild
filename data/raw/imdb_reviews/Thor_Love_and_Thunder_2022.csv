1,20 July 2022,blott2319-1,3," Worst MCU yet, things keep getting worse...
","I think most people thought it was a big mistake when Disney cut ties with Lord & Miller before they completed their Solo film. Now I'm not so sure. It's a little off-putting having a downright farcical movie in an established cinematic universe. Thor: Love and Thunder is about as grounded as a Naked Gun movie, but for some reason the comedy rarely hits for me, where I can enjoy it in an actual spoof. I was surprised, despite the nearly constant attempts at humor, the crowded theater I was in rarely did more than chuckle. If they're going to make a straight-up comedy then they need it to be more laugh-out-loud funny. Of course comedic taste is extremely subjective, so I'm sure some people enjoy laughing along. I just wish it was as effective as Taika Waititi's other films have been for me (including Thor Ragnarok.)",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

Thor, Valkyrie and Jane never seemed afraid of him in the least.

Only good thing was I was able to go see Back Phone after 80 mins of this crap and actually found a movie I really enjoyed that I normally wouldn't have seen. Way better filmmaking and acting. The jokes in this Thor aren't even funny, it's like they try to get the audience to laugh with them but we end up laughing at them.

Sadly in MCU Thor was only once really Thor and it was in Avengers: Infinity War, where we finally feel that he is the protector of Midgard and the God of thunder as in mythology. I'm not saying that Taika Waititi is a bad director, but the fact is he wrote and directed this empty movie with some jokes. He could maybe make a great Deadpool movie but Thor should have been more than this. Even Christian Bale's outstanding performance as Gorr couldn't save it. The real Thor fans aren't going to enjoy this movie.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

62,7 July 2022,Zeus-pro,7," If you don't compare it to Ragnarok, then Love and Thunder is enjoyable
","Thor: Love and Thunder is largely successful in honoring Thor's long journey towards self-actualization and rarely falters while keying into the crackling chemistry between leads Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, and Tessa Thompson. It's essentially the MCU's first romantic comedy, and plays with those tropes in delightful ways. But while Thor and Jane's relationship is handled well, Love and Thunder is less deft -- and a lot safer than you'd expect -- in pushing the greater MCU story forward. Christian Bale's Gorr feels underutilized and Tessa Thompson's King Valkyrie takes a frustrating back seat, especially as the movie goes on. Taika Waititi's signature humor and visual style persist from Ragnarok, and are essential to buoying the movie through its cookie-cutter plot. With Hemsworth as enthusiastic an Asgardian as ever, Thor's future with both love and thunder are bright.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

Well talking about the movie if you know the movie director than you should probably get the idea of his movie making. As I being completely honest I was expecting more but still I like it what the director has deliver us. Chris Hemsworth is far More better than in the endgame. Natalie & Tessa simply nailed it with rest of the cast. Story could've been more better because you have such a powerful villain but I don't know what the director thought and movies runtime could be long rather than it's Christian Bale just nailed it. Yeah he has less screentime but whenever he comes at screen he'll just made your day. Director should've given a lot more time to Gorr but still nonetheless.

Don't get me wrong, I did laugh at some bits, but then immediately thought this is ridiculous.

The movie was way too fast paced and didn't flesh out enough of the story. Jane having cancer was mentioned but added up to not too much especially considering the post credit scene, it was a little sad but wasn't really held on in a moment. Thor was alright in it I wouldn't say I'm a huge fan, he's goofy and somewhat cool. Christian Bale though... Gorr the ""God Butcher"" himself! He did in fact live up to the name in the opening scene, but then where was the rest of it? Was it cut? The name and the look alone was scary but the actions weren't, no consequences or fear of losing any characters along the way. Gorr was watered down and your just supposed to imagine him killing gods I suppose. And he really wasn't in the movie that much either, they seriously under-utilised Christian Bale and did Gorr dirty. Can't say I was bothered by either of the post credit scenes. It was just fun there's nothing really more to it. Just way too fast paced, even more so than doctor strange which managed to pull it off so either it's the writing or things were cut and the movie should've been longer.

Though Robert Downey Jr. And Chris Evans have retired their parts as Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, there was still the consolation that Chris Hemsworth would continue as Thor, the Asgardian God of Thunder. Hemsworth is a perfect fit in the role, with a real movie star's physical presence, and a good sense for comedy, two attributes that are not always evident in others.

After the widely popular and fun Ragnarok, this venture was surprising in the sense that the same cast and same director could produce such a joke of a movie. I did laugh in the movie but that was a pity laugh and I was laughing at how bad a movie could be. Many believe that it was not as bad. I myself felt that I wasted my money. I did not enjoy the movie. The superhero movies are not the same. I find myself falling out of love with these kinds of movies. I think I do not have the heart of a 10-year-old anymore. I have grown I guess. I love the mature content. I love something that I could relate to. For instance, I love the boys. I love the Zack Snyder iteration of superhero movies. They have a heavy tone and contain mature content that I can resonate with. The fart jokes are not funny anymore. The audience has grown along with the movies. After such heavy movies like endgame and infinity war, going back to silly things are idiotic on the part of Marvel. Finding a balance between what you cater to the mature audience all the while keeping the children interested is the trick and Marvel should learn better to walk that fine line. But as things stand they are leaning over to the side of making small children happy. Thus, the reason for people's low rating of recent movies. Superhero fatigue is real and has caught up to me. I don't think I will see any of the Marvel movies unless they promise something new and mature.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

","I dont know what happened to the movie, it was at all times, a disappointment. The story of gorr is one of hte most interesting in the comics and here, he barely appears, he has 3 scenes of dialogue, a fight scene, the final fight scene and its over, hes dead. Valkyrie and Korg are annoying for me, the do nothing all the movie but to tell stupid jokes and to be gay. Thor while being funny in other movies like Ragarok or Endgame, you felt he still had its serious moments or realization, of growth, etc; but not in this movie, he is pure stupid, all the time he is just thinking in what his next joke is going to be, Jane foster also has the same problems, a character that was serious in previous movies and now is going throught a very serious stage in her life due to cancer, is also only thinking in the next joke to say. Fortunately, shes still the best part of the movie because to a certain extent, she is a little bit more serious and has her moments. But all the movie feels like that, a joke, and the worst part is that they dont make you laugh either, they sometimes tell the same joke over and over until you just cant stand it anymore or is the most stupid joke youve ever heard. On the good things, you could say that the fight scenes are really cool, not on the level as ragnarok, but still OK, the soundtrack is also cool but it has the problem that almost none is implemented correctly, and also the colors and normally the stethic of the movie is cool, with very bright colors and good designs.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

","With review I'm going to try and not speak about anything to do with comic book accuracy, mainly because in short you can definitely throw any of that out of the window with this movie, and instead I am going to just focus on the film itself and why I don't like it. First of all I just want to say that Thor Love & Thunder is the first ever comic book film I watched where there felt like there was nearly zero at stake. The tone of the movie is just so all over the place, the dialogue was something that my 8 year old nephew could come up with, the story seemed good on paper but was not executed well and that could be because there might be a lot of things removed, the pacing just made me feel like I was watching this for almost three hours when in all reality it was among one of the shortest of the Marvel films. Wrap up all of these issues into one big bow and you got a product that feels like actually two separate films in one movie. I briefly scrolled through some of the other reviews on here and saw plenty of complaints this time around on Thor's personality, and how he's just in a full on idiotic form. In recent years, I have been feeling very strongly about this matter and it is in full effect within Love and Thunder to the point that it is blatantly obvious. As someone who did not care for Ragnarok I was not expecting a majority the humor to resonate well with me, I wont lie and say it was totally and purely awful, I think Waititi definitely nails the Guardians of the galaxy's humor well, not as much the Thor humor though. I didn't find most of the jokes in the movie funny and I think its safe to say that it appeared that my screening did not find most of the jokes funny either between the friend I attended with actually expressing to me he felt like he was almost ""forced to laugh"" at many of the jokes and the lack of the audience expressing a sign of laughter on most of the jokes. As it is, for whatever reason it may be, the runtime was restrictive enough as it was in a movie with a lot to accomplish, If only more time was focused on developing certain plot points, relationships, characters (especially Gorr the not-so-God butcher), and adding necessary details instead of focusing what joke they could nail next, I believe the impact that the audience was supposed to feel walking out at the end would have been greater, made more sense, and maybe even I would have liked it more.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

","With such star power and serious acting ability how on earth didn't somebody yell STOP? This isn't working! Write a script worthy of the actors who clearly did their job in preparation for this mess. All the blame for the much anticipated and highly hyped Thor: Love and Thunder lays at the feet of its director/writer Taika Waititi and I can't believe I had to write that. Often brilliant, all I could think of was why he didn't pass if he didn't want to make another Thor movie! I'm actually worried that someone will get the wrong impression that there isn't a story to tell about Thor when I'd pay to see this one again with a good script and with proper use of the available talent. These movies are made for young teens and enjoyed by adults and this turned me back into an early teen stomping my feet and yelling in my head at the screen for the lame jokes, the pitiful use of Russell Crowe, the tragedy of the lack of use of Christian Bale, (he finally has been given the right role to bother with a Marvel movie and you butcher his story?), the very indifferent story given to Natalie Portman to address the situation she is living in, and on and on. Why were The Guardians even there? Another complete waste! How do you manage to waste Chris Pratt and Brad Cooper too? Not to mention the star!! Hemsworth worked unbelievably hard to prepare for this movie and even he was wasted in this nothing burger, poorly conceived and genuinely indifferent direction with no story, certainly not one worth telling, of what could shoulda woulda been THE blockbuster of the summer! WHO LET THIS HAPPEN!! I'm very worried that the wrong people will get the idea that there isn't a Thor story left to tell when this actor, who has basically dedicated his career to playing him and cares every bit as much as Benedict Cumberbatch does about portraying Dr. Strange, won't get credit where it's due because so much trust was placed in the wrong director because he had a hit with Ragnerok. He keeps saying he didn't want to make it again when that's exactly what he did! This story called for a script that took the material seriously, including humour that hit the target instead of lame 6 year old jokes! And mostly it needed the time, that extra 40 minutes given to Dr. Strange, to fully give Gorr the time he needed to show us his rage and anguish becoming the God Butcher, there's never been an actor better qualified to play a character with the depth of this one (think Oscar Isaac as Moon Knight, where was Christian Bale's chance to bring his incredible performance out of the shadow because he was robbed of story time?). And also time to truly let us feel that Natalie's Jane Foster was the love of Thor's life who this all powerful god could do nothing to save? Where was their moment? Honestly Mr. Waititi, I don't think you wanted to make another Thor movie period and you should have been big enough to pass on it or get help when you knew your script wasn't nearly enough to properly serve the characters in a movie that clearly WASN'T Ragnerok but an epic tale which you admittedly said you filled with every single suggestion received by 6 year olds. How could you? How do you sleep? You're the king of comedy in New Zealand but you're more than that, you can be overly silly but you're extremely intelligent and must have known this was headed off the rails early enough to save it from a near complete disaster!

There are good actors in this movie but their characters are stupid and too goofy for us to appreciate them. Thankfully, Anthony Hopkins' character is dead, otherwise we would have heard him tell fart jokes. The dialogue is the worst part by far, with most lines sounding like they were written by 4th graders.

","Love and Thunder is a glorious misfire, a tone-deaf amplification of the first movie dead set on delivering more of everything that made Ragnarok such a welcome change at the time. Most of the time it's a painfully unfunny screwball comedy where Thor's role as the village idiot is amped up to eleven, while a running joke involving screaming goats and Lady Thor's search for a suitable catchphrase make up the rest of the movie's many, many moments of levity. This is juxtaposed with serious moments involving terminal illness of a character the producers thought needed some sort of undercooked closure. The budget, which could eradicate hunger in a small eastern European country, is mostly wasted on achingly blinding CGI that gives the film the sheen of a Saturday morning cartoon. Most of the supporting cast is utterly wasted, including Russel Crowe's buffoonery as Zeus and Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie, who the writers couldn't find anything noteworthy to do but is in the move anyway. Christian Bale turns in a stellar performance as the movie's villain, and his backstory would've made for a more interesting movie than the one he's in.

","Thor: Love and Thunder didn't seem interested in distinguishing itself as its own movie; instead, it acted as a continuation of the wildly well-received Thor: Ragnarok. I imagine Waititi felt that movie performed so well, critically and financially, that it was an open invitation for him to make the fourth entry in the Thor series even more zany. It's true that he has his own aesthetic, but it's an aesthetic that feels calculated rather than one that has naturally manifested itself as his career has progressed. Love and Thunder was overloaded with hit-or-miss jokes, while the dialogue felt obnoxiously simplistic, as though it had been dumbed down to a level appropriate for a children's book. Still, there were certain scenes that worked to perfection, like the cinematically blissful battle in the shadow realm. And although he didn't have as much screen time as I would have liked, Russell Crowe emanated pure likeability as Waititi's rendition of Zues. There is no doubt it would get my attention should they decide to pursue a Zues spinoff movie. As for another Thor movie, I'm indifferent.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

Its Just Thor's opportunity to show of his overpowered skills, but yeah, where and why, is there an importance of Jane foster? Making her weak and killing her in the movie was the exact moment where i jumped out from my seat hell no, i still cant believe this happened! Its been like many years Thor Ragnarok have released and this one didn't came up to tbe level of thor Ragnarok but, its a good visual treat to watch, the second thing is Zeus is like a Banana in this movie, why? Zeus cant even touch thor, why marvel? Why Taika? Atleast a bit more advanced skilled zeus we, expected But this was a bit far, not gonna lie. Yeah the Third is Gorr, the god butcher. Ok thanks for not destroying that character's spirit or his power it was well made, and yeah the point is my dear Christian Bale! Hats off to your acting most of the emotional scene made me crying and the terrorism of the character and the build up was pretty good, i loved it, but Not gonna lie, let me be honest, Thor Ragnarok was 3 times better than this movie, or is it me Who had this thought? Ok, then Guardians of the Galaxies, they are kinda having a cameo role! Frankly they dont have screen presence for more than 14 minutes i guess. But if Taika Waititi had made the movie's direction bit more cool, then this movie will be an all time entertainer, and folks thor part 5 will be there as he digs a hole in zeus's chest with Zeus's Thunderbolt weapon, Zeus's son Hercules seeks for Revenge against thor, and the next good news is Thor is a Dad to a girl. Because the last of Gorr the Good butcher was, 'Thor, look after my love, look after my love of my life´ which is Gorr's Daughter when she got Reborn. And still hate the fact that she calls him 'Uncle Thor´Lol. And Atlast movie refers to Love as Thor's adopted Daughter which is Gorr's own Daughter and Thunder for Thor Odinson, and atlast movie concludes with the post Credit scene of Zeus Asking his son to seek Revenge against thor and Jane Foster finally Landing up on Valhalla which is the place where Asgardian Gods and people live for the rest of eternity on their Life after Death where she meets Heimdall.

","Thor has always been a tough character to pull off (in the film and in the comics), and I feel like the MCU movies figured out a way to do this really well in previous movies. The first two, are a lot darker, and the humor is peppered here and there. With Ragnarok, they cranked up the humor, and in my opinion made one of the best movies in the MCU. All the elements really worked in that instance. The balance of comedy and seriousness was perfect. With ""Love and Thunder"" I feel like the film makers said ""People loved the humor in Ragnarok, let's do that all movie long!"" Unfortunately this just made for a silly movie. This is a two and a half hour comedy, that just comes across as cheesy and silly. Some really intense events happen to the characters and the universe as a whole, but none of these events feel like they have any weight because of the onslaught of silly jokes before, after, and occasionally, during them. This is really unfortunate because you have an absolutely amazing cast (Christian freaking Bale as the antagonist!) that is pretty much wasted on a goofy movie. My wife thought this was one of the worst movies in the MCU (and one of the worst we have seen this this year) and she has previously loved the Thor movies (mostly because of Chris Hemsworth being shirtless and Idris Elba). Not even a super jacked Hemsworth made this enjoyable for her. I enjoy comedy, and think the MCU typically does a great job of finding the right balance. There were some elements of this film that I really enjoyed however, that balance is totally absent in this film. I had been really looking forward to seeing this movie since I saw the first trailer, with Guns N Roses blasting in it, and I was really disappointed in the final product.

","I went into this movie hopeful, but was left disappointed. This movie starts out strong with an introduction to Gorr and his daughter. It's a good, simple set-up for his tragic motivation as the villain. There's tension and emotion. Unfortunately from here, Waititi takes every opportunity to undercut any tension or drama from every scene. He saw that his trademark silly humor worked for Ragnarok and he dialed it up to 11 for Love and Thunder - to the detriment of the entire movie. Gorr kidnaps a large group of children from New Asgard, and considering the magnitute of this act, Thor and Valkyrie coming off as entirely unphased and jokey about the situation absolutely destroys any sense of urgency or consequence that should be present. And despite the potential Bale had as Gorr, he comes and goes and is entirely wasted instead of remaining a lurking threat among the MCU. Despite losing a significant Thor character by the end of the film as well, that outcome is predictable at every turn and the plot as a whole seems totally inconsequential in the long run. While Ragnarok was able to portray some weight to the loss of significant characters, Love and Thunder can't take itself seriously for even a moment. The visuals, while very much the kind of over-the-top comic book visual style I enjoy, come off as significantly cheaper than it's predecessors. The green-screen is horrendous and the CGI characters and creatures stick out sorely as if they were made 10 years ago. The action and wirework is much sloppier and obvious this time around.

Jane Foster is handled well enough but is also shallow as her story arc is undercut by joke after joke after joke. You can say the same thing about the entire movie itself. It's like the director was required to put a joke a minute into the movie no matter the situation. What results is a shallow mockery that is a notch above Batman and Robin but certainly a low point in the Marvel cinematic universe.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

Cartoonish and poorly written soundings, not even the direction of Taika Waititi saves, the good director has some glimpses of originality, especially at the beginning of the third act, otherwise it seems that the feature was made in 30 days.

And what stuck kind of stinks. Thor has become like Ross on Friends: He started out cool and interesting, but the writers have turned him into a total goofball. Thor's humor is great, but not when goofiness becomes his chief defining characteristic. The basic plot had potential, but the development of it is mostly ridiculous. To avoid spoilers, I'll simply say that some of the new gods introduced in this film left me scratching my head. The backstory that is included about Thor and Jane is poorly conceived and lacks any compelling substance. While the woke content in this film is relatively minor, what little there is feels entirely inorganic, like it was forced into the film in order to appease political activists. And, while there is a never-ending barrage of jokes in the film, very few of them are very funny.

Background and development of the villain was good (as usual) but felt like they fast forwarded a bit through Jane's development/story along with other characters that seem like will be around in the future. Good acting and some great cameo's like Luke Hemsworth playing Thor during a play in the movie. Finally, felt like it was a bit lost as to the age of target audience they were targeting as it was a bit of a hard PG-13 but at the same time it had a bit too many childish moments for adults.

","This period of history will be remembered by those who survive it as a time when the Rule Book was thrown out the window and chaos reigned. A hundred years ago, monopoly laws prevented the concentration of media in corporate hands. Beach movies in the 1960s always included at least one lonely millionaire wandering around in the cast -- lonely because he owned a TV station or radio station or newspaper and could only sell it to another lone millionaire. The Clinton era changed that. Four conglomerates today own 99% of the western media. Disney buying Marvel was arguably the coup de grace. You now have companies creating markets for content rather than content for markets. Sometimes it works (WANDAVISION). Sometimes it does not. (THOR LOVE & THUNDER). But it is now their game.

677,8 July 2022,GusherPop,6," Funny as hell, but not as good as the first 3 Thor Films
","'Thor: Love and Thunder"" is, like most of the Marvel films since Iron Man died, only intermittently amusing, a bit wobbly in its storytelling, thin in its emotional impact and more geared toward spectacle than coherence. Thor's latest planet-skipping adventures are built around the party-rock atmosphere of several Guns N' Roses tracks, notably ""Sweet Child o' Mine,"" but, alas, the song's refrain ""Where do we go? Where do we go now? Where do we go?"" is all too apt for the movie's directionless, make-it up as we go along style. Here are a lot of things I love about Waititi's approach to Thor, but my favorite is that they are now comedies. While ""Ragnarok"" was packed with jokes, I think ""Love and Thunder"" embraces the comedy aspect even more. The trailers let us know there would be plenty of laughs, but it also felt like it may try to be a bit more serious. Well, thankfully, that was the trailer, not the movie. ""Love and Thunder"" is listed as an action, adventure and comedy. What it actually is, is a comedy with some action and adventure. I laughed out loud so many times and just when you start feeling like things are getting serious, you get a perfectly timed gag and the tension is released. Often times when a movie is trying to be funny or full of action, the filmmakers tend to sacrifice story and emotion for spectacle. This is not the case with ""Love and Thunder."" Waititi understands in order to make the jokes land and the action hit, you have to care about what is happening. I don't want to give anything away, so I'll be vague here, but there is a rich story filled with love, wanting, loneliness, heartache and sorrow. These heavier elements create a story we're invested in as an audience, but it's balanced expertly with humor, adventure and plenty of spectacle. I cared about Thor, Jane and even Christian Bale's Gorr. Waititi and his team created relatable characters, strong storylines and plenty of drama. We've had a few opportunities to see this, but Hemsworth is a brilliant comedic actor. His timing and delivery are pitch-perfect and make for an egocentric Thor with a heart of gold, and you can't help but love him. Hemsworth was the perfect choice for this role and it's ever more evidenced in ""Love and Thunder."" We all know Natalie Portman is a fine actress, but her chemistry with Hemsworth is palpable and she brings a certain sense of humanity to the film that is essential to its success.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

His quirky humor, great soundtracks, and attention to deft pacing and comedic timing made that film, while far from perfect, a unique standout that helped create a fresher vision of Thor as a character that not only would ultimately set him up for ""Infinity War"" and ""Endgame,"" but provide a blueprint for how directors could still put at least a somewhat unique stamp of their own on the Marvel formula. I'm not necessarily a hardcore fan of Waititi (""Jojo Rabbit"" was not for me,) but still appreciate his idiosyncrasies and interests in using humor and irony to pepper stories in unexpected and distinct ways. With that said, given that I enjoyed ""Ragnarok"" and also love Christian Bale (who plays Gorr, the film's villain,) I was hoping this sequel would deliver.

I asked myself at a certain point during the movie if I'm actually watching the latest spoof film that was the newest entry of the 'scary movie' franchise. The runtime is way too short to accomplish anything it needs to do and I'm not even so sure I blame that one on Waititi as much as the studio. So much is wasted here and it's kind of sad, Lady Sif's return was being hyped this whole time all over the place and she shows up for probably 3-4 minutes of the whole film and half of that is a joke, The content of the ending makes no sense to me maybe because it was so short lived that it felt very random and weird? Bale's Gorr The God Butcher and the threat that he is supposed to be really amounts to nothing. Waititi had knocked a home run out of the park with me regarding 'Jojo Rabbit' with his emotional scenes and good storytelling, it's really too bad he just doesn't bring that side of his filmmaking to Thor.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

It was about a half hour into the story when I finally realized that's the way it was going to be for the duration. It was too much, and interfered with what should have been the intensity of Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) mission to take down Gorr, the God Butcher (Christian Bale). Cinematically, the picture was on a par with prior films in the franchise and the special effects were fine as always, so no problem there. But the business about Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) receiving chemotherapy for Stage Four cancer and the jokes associated with it hit me the wrong way, since I personally know three people undergoing that treatment for different forms of the disease and it's really no laughing matter. The Guns n' Roses soundtrack seemed appropriate for the story with the driving beat of each song that complemented the action, though given the resolution with Jane entering Valhalla at the finale, they could have included 'Knockin' on Heaven's Door' for the windup. Wonder why they didn't think of that.

Gosh. Latest SM movie was also disgusting. New DS just average. What was the last the can be even called not bad? Black Widow? Eternals? Well, MAY BE! The last good were i'd say Avengers? MCU never had lots of good movies. I'd say Iron Man and Homecoming are the best, solid, last 2 Avengers movies are good(well, i suppose Age of Ultron and Civil War are not that far, but the first Avengers if you look and them now(personally i was in cinema on premiere in 2012, being 13y.o, Avengers entered theatres 1 day before my birthday) have bad dialogues, like they were written by some young schooler and spoils it all) and probably i'd say that i like most of all other Thor 3, though it failed in the end, and couldn't decide either it wants to be an epic action or entertainment. What's about this movie? It just sums it up what we already saw before: whole thing turns into a toothless child cringe ""comedy"". Remember when we had that epic feeling before, like in Avengers, that something big is happening, that heroes are cool? Forget it! All main cast just turned into clown and ""celebrities"" of the show. And you could miss it but, it started back at the Iron Man 3, that idiotic direction and vision. I'm tired of all this feigned fun, pathetic wink to the viewer and circus, yeah this movie feels kinda average but this is just over the top. Oh, wait, what do we have here?

","The first Thor movie was good, The Dark World was very good, Ragnarok was fantastic and my favourite so far, this next sequel featuring the Marvel Cinematic Universe hero picks up from the events of Avengers: Endgame, written and directed by Taika Waititi (What We Do in the Shadows, Jojo Rabbit). Basically, in a barren desert, Gorr (Christian Bale) and his daughter Love (India Rose Hemsworth, Chris's daughter) are the last of their people, and struggle to survive. Despite praying to their god, Rapu, Love dies of starvation. Close to death himself, Gorr discovers an oasis and encounters Rapu (Jonny Brugh) himself, who possess an ancient weapon known as All-Black the Necrosword. Rapu makes fun of Gorr for his helplessness and refuses to help him. Feeling betrayed, Gorr takes the Necrosword, beheads Rapu, and vows to kill all the gods. Gorr is granted the ability to manipulate shadows and produce monsters but is cursed with impending death and corrupted by the sword's influence. Elsewhere, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has lost the weight he gained during the Blip and has joined the Guardians of the Galaxy on many adventures to bring peace to various worlds throughout the universe. But, following the destruction of his home planet Asgard, he is going through a midlife crisis, trying to figure out his purpose. After leaving the Guardians, Thor responds to a distress call from Asgardian warrior Sif (Jaimie Alexander), his childhood friend, finding her injured and warns him of Gorr, and that he plans to target New Asgard. Meanwhile, Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), Thor's ex-girlfriend, has terminal cancer and has been going through medical treatment which has been proving ineffective. Reading books about Norse mythology, Jane reads about the power of Thor's fractured hammer Mjolnir, and travels to New Asgard hoping that it might heal her. Due to an enchantment Thor unknowingly placed on it years earlier to protect Foster, Mjolnir reforges and bonds itself to her. As Gorr begins to attack New Asgard, Thor arrives, and they fight. During the battle, Thor is surprised to see Jane has become the Mighty Thor wielding his hammer. Nevertheless, they team up with New Asgard King Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and Kronan gladiator Korg (Taika Waititi) to fight Gorr. The group thwarts Gorr, but he escapes, kidnapping several Asgardian children and imprisoning them in the Shadow Realm. The group travels to Omnipotence City, a realm that is home to many gods, to warn them and ask for their help. The leader of the gods, Zeus (Russell Crowe), fears Gorr and refuses to help, thinking that they will be safe remaining and hiding in the city. Zeus orders the group are captured to prevent them from exposing the city's location, but a fight breaks out, during which Korg's body is destroyed but his face remains alive. Thor impales Zeus with his own thunderbolt, which Valkyrie steals before they escape. As the group continue their journey, Thor and Jane rekindle their romantic relationship and she reveals her illness. The group arrives at the Shadow Realm but are unable to find the children. Jane deduces that this is a trap for Gorr to take Thor's axe, Stormbreaker, which can summon the Bifrost, so he can enter the realm of Eternity and make a wish to destroy all gods. Gorr overpowers the group, severely injuring Valkyrie. The group retreats to Earth, while Gorr manages to steal Stormbreaker. Jane has been drained of her strength each time she uses Mjolnir, Thor warns her that using it once more will likely kill her and persuades her to let him fight Gorr alone while she recuperates. Thor finds the kidnapped children at Eternity's altar and, using Zeus's thunderbolt, gives the children powers to fight against Gorr's monsters. While Thor fights Gorr, Jane sense him, and when Gorr is about to kill him, she chooses to join the battle with Mjolnir to save him. They destroy the Necrosword, freeing Gorr from its influence, but he, Thor and Jane are brought into Eternity's realm. With Gorr ready to make his wish, Thor implores Gorr to revive his daughter instead of destroying the gods. Thor leaves Gorr to make his decision and holds Jane, who succumbs to her illness. Gorr is moved seeing Thor and Jane together, and wishes for Eternity to revive Love, which is granted. As Gorr dies from the curse, he asks Thor to take care of Love. Back in New Asgard, Korg's body is restored, and he has started a family, Jane's sacrifice has been honoured with a stone statue, and Valkyrie and Sif train the children to become future warriors. Thor adopts Love, who joins him in his adventures, with Thor wielding Mjolnir and Love wielding Stormbreaker. In the mid-credits scene, Zeus is recuperating and sends his son Hercules (Brett Goldstein) to kill Thor. In the post-credits scene, Janes arrives at the gates of Valhalla (a realm like Heaven), where she is welcomed by Heimdall (Idris Elba). Also starring Chris Pratt as Peter Quill aka Star-Lord, Dave Bautista as Drax (as David Bautista), Karen Gillan as Nebula, Pom Klementieff as Mantis, Sean Gunn as Kraglin, Vin Diesel as Groot, Bradley Cooper as Rocket, Ben Falcone (Melissa McCarthy's husband) as Asgardian Stage Manager, Luke Hemsworth (Chris's brother) as Actor Thor, Matt Damon as Actor Loki, Melissa McCarthy as Actor Hela, and Sam Neill as Actor Odin. Hemsworth is still likeable being the muscular space Viking, Portman is likeable as his powered-up ex going from cancer-stricken brown hair to blonde super warrior, Bale is a reasonably menacing villain playing the ""God Butcher"" (being chalk white he looks like the Nun from The Conjuring series), and there is good support from Thompson and Crowe. The attempts by the makers to be knowingly funny or clever don't all work, with Jane trying to ""find a catchphrase"", Thor missing his treasured hammer, and the two screaming goats, some of the catchy rock music is a little distracting, and the special effects aren't completely up to scratch, but there is enough spectacle and exciting sequences, an alright superhero fantasy action.

It focuses too much on children ages 4 to 9 years old. What made all the other Thor movies enjoyable was that they targeted the generation that grew up reading the 1960 and 1970 comics. An adult has trouble understanding the theoretical physics of the time space continuum and quantum mechanics, so how is a child going to relate to these complex theories? Yet the movie is targeting young children as the demographic with these themes. At times I was waiting for the Muppets to dance across the screen and a romper room sing-along.

","Yeah too much of everything kind of, like for example the screaming giant space goats, it would have been funny as a one-off joke but it's something that pops up throughout the whole movie! And this movie really assumes you must love Korg a whole lot because he has not one but three patronising narrations that open and close the movie and bring you up to date with what happened between here and Endgame, and I didn't like those scenes very much as they just didn't do it for me and felt like a lazy attempt to condense the story and get it moving faster, one would have worked at the beginning of the movie but it's overdone, and so is Korg grossly, I thought he worked much better in Ragnarok because he and the schtick approach was new and was done much better and just enough for it to not be to obnoxious in that movie, but here I felt sick of him within moments and he way overstayed his welcome and was just annoying as fk!! Urg it's like the movie was made for severely attention deficit people who can't sit still and take in a movie for like two minutes, it was terrified of slowing down even just a little and just letting the story breathe for a while, the rapid fire jokes were for me having a bad effect on the more serious aspects and the pathos, I thought it clashed horribly when it would go from her as the lady Thor to sick and dying in the hospital, you simply cannot plonk something as deadly serious as freaking cancer in a movie like this and expect it to work, it's like having Billy get a brain tumour in Gremlins 2! It felt like there was a really good movie in there somewhere, just between Thor Jane and Gorr but it didn't focus on that enough, I really didn't think Natalie Portman and Chris Hemsworth has any chemistry at all in the original movie but here I thought the opposite, they're a little older and things have changed a lot since that picture and she seemed more relaxed than before and I liked her as a warrior woman I thought it was cool, I was surprised by how she ended up at the end I thought it was surprisingly sad, don't worry about her coming back in any sequels folks! Christian Bale was surprisingly awesome and very creepy as the villain, I thought he came off as genuinely insane and lethal, I wanted more of him, he was probably the most threatening villain in a marvel movie yet. I also loved how his story ended as well, never expected to see one of the biggest cosmic entities of the Marvel universe in one of the movies, kudos to Taika for not having Eternity crack some goofy joke, although I'm sure it was severely tempting! There was definitely some awesome things in it, I loved the visuals and some of the huge locations, and the hall of the gods and the silly Zeus was where I thought the comedy did work really well and I liked that scene a lot with Thor declaring the gods cowardly and ticking off the most lazy Zeus ever, look forward to see where that leads in the future. I was overall slightly disappointed with this, it took what worked for Ragnarok and cranks it up to eleven and for some that might work but for me the comedy was mostly just annoying and obnoxious, frequently stopped the movie dead and prevented it from really ever taking off in a big way, this overstuffed cosmic mess of a film proves that Mr Waititi is capable of overestimating his strengths as a director and also that he could really do with learning a little restraint!

","Thor is one of my favorite characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Although not all his films were perfect, the direction that has been decided to take with his character has been an emotional and awesome reinvention of what used to be a character that lacked an interesting personality. This film builds upon the events of the previous films that Thor has appeared in and develops a character study of a man who has lost everything and is now in the midst of an identity crisis. This is brilliantly illustrated through the black comedy approach brought upon by director Taika Waititi who is able to balance the sillier aspects of the story as well as the dramatic undertones that breathes life into this film. The visuals are stunning, injecting the world of the Marvel Universe with color and life that is the equivalent of candy for the eyes. The performances are amazing with Chris Hemsworth owning his role as Thor by injecting an admirable balance of comedy and tragedy. Natalie Portman's return as Jane Foster was perfectly handled with her character arc being an emotional beat and justification for the previous films that she appeared in. However, Christian Bale as the antagonist, Gorr the God Butcher, was undeniably one of the film's greatest strengths. His performance was an artistic approach never fully explored in the MCU, delving into an emotional and sinister angle that makes him easily the best villain Marvel has produced. Although some may argue that the film is too silly for its own good, the comedy is brilliantly balanced with drama that will leave the audience in amazement at what it was able to accomplish throughout. The implications of what can happen next in the story of Thor left me in anticipation of what can come next for this hero, and I cannot wait to be there to see it throughout.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

","Without a doubt the worst in the Thor franchise. That unfortunately speaks volumes because as it's common knowledge at this point THOR TDW is too comedic as is. Thor 2 was the worst until this was created. I'm sure on paper it was brilliant. But as is now? The execution of this tale is horrendous, and without a doubt now the new fabled WORST of the series. The character Bale attempts pales in comparison to the character's comic counterpart; instead of referring to him as GORR they should have just created a new villain with aspects of GORRs identity. That at least would have organically justified the difference. GORR coulda been a palindrome or anagram heck the title the ""necro-sword bearer"" becomes; similar to a Kurse characterization. I don't know, something. The story itself is thin and weighs itself down by the family comedy. At times this can be the most serious of Thor films then it flips and has a bunch of improvisational jokes and humor. It undercuts the tone, jarringly so. It's an odd mixture and doesn't work in any cohesive way. The direction is well done and looks supremely crafted but that's all. The director was given too much creative control or freedom after the success of the previous Thor installment (speculation). This movie is the director literally IMO without any reigns. Can I validate that belief? No I cannot. But the humor detracts the viewer rather than endearing them to the story. It's a shame bc it's apparent the cast (all stellar no need to single anyone out) is having a great time. You as the viewer though will not (speculative) have the same great time all involved clearly are having. Worst MCU film to date.

The film draws from previous efforts by Marvel and Taika Waititi to present the Thor franchise in a more quirky and comedic way, but it falls flat due to overuse and repetition. This style was pioneered mainly by the predecessor Thor: Ragnarok, when it had novelty value compared to the first two Thor films, but now the effect has worn off and Waititi feels like he's retreading the same territory. For example, there's a scene involving stage actors that appears to be almost exactly the same scene as in Ragnarok. The positive aspects of this film include the serious elements like Christian Bale's performance as Gorr the God Butcher, the stark monochromatic palette, the realm of the gods and Natalie Portman's character development, but these are juxtaposed too heavily with the constant comedy, making the tone very inconsistent. Besides that, the glaring flaw is that the stakes are just not that interesting - some children are kidnapped (but they don't seem to be in that much mortal peril) and some gods are also in danger (whom we barely see anyway) - making the protagonist's quest feel not so compelling.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

Seeing as this movie was directed by Taika Waititi who seemed to have taken more creative liberties with Thor: Ragnarok, I was expecting succeeding films to continue in the spirit of exploring different artistic directions. Unfortunately, this movie ended up being very standard Marvel fair. Initially interested by Bale's casting, I was baited into spending money at a movie theater only to realize he was painfully underutilized. Moreover, whatever drama/tension the movie manages to scrap together is severely undercut by an excessive amount of jokes that didn't manage to resonate with general audiences. It was nice seeing Jane Foster again (it must've been for somebody, at least), but her arc is totally unnecessary and only really serves to market the movie by having ""Lady Thor"" in it. Nothing her character did in the movie was interesting; even her death was uneventful.

","T's a bit nick picky, but it is not as good as the last Thor movie. I always expect these marvel movies to get better and better to the point that they put the movie before it to shame. Still, this sequel to the Thor branch of the Marvel cinematic universe franchise did not exceed expectations. It had action, adventure, and humor, which I was expecting from Taika Waititi, who also directed Ragnarok, and that was great. Still, in Love and Thunder, the humor outshined the action-adventure. Not necessarily entirely a bad thing because the humor was so on point. Never did I feel a joke was dropped that did not deliver the laughs it expected, but I do feel these laughs came at the price of the action-adventure, which was lacking. The visuals in the movie were epic. Waititi knows how to film a sci-fi Fantasy, especially one that pays homage to the 1980s (although the constant use of Gun and Roses songs was not as spectacular as using Immrgant song by Led Zepplin twice in Ragnarok). As the movie progressed, the visuals got better and better to the point where a complete introduction of a marvel comics character making his first full appearance in the cinematic universe was breathtaking. Waititi was working that camera. The performances from the whole cast were good. I could go on about how great Chris Hemsworth is as Thor and his fantastic chemistry with Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie but what impressed me was Natalie Portman's return as Jane Foster (AKA Thor). I was not expecting much from the actress who seemed bitterly glad to end her ties with the franchise, but from the moment she appeared on the screen, she was dynamite in my book. I love every minute of her. Also, Russel Crowe's run as Zeus was enjoyable. It solidified everything this movie was about, and you can tell he enjoyed his role. Well done! Overall, Thor: love & Thunder was laid out like a comic book. As easily as I sat in the theatre watching, was easy as if I had sat in my living room reading it.

","It's no secret that I loved what Taika Waititi did with ""Thor: Ragnarok""; he made me fall in love with Thor again after really getting bored of the character in ""Thor: The Dark World"". And I am so happy to report that he has done it again with ""Thor: Love and Thunder""! I still love his comedic take on Thor so much, it still works so well for me, and I was thrilled to see that he finally was able to make the Jane Foster character, as well as her relationship to Thor, work so well and come off as so likable! I finally cared about the relationship between Thor and Jane as well (for the first time in the MCU); I was so happy to see that the elements that didn't work for me in the past were able to become something so much more in this film, and I fully attribute that to Taika's skills at writing great characters and great relationships! He is especially skilled at blending his signature style of silly comedy with some heartfelt emotion, and that is on full display here!

","Having not seen ""Thor"" since the first installment, I wasn't prepared for how director Taika Waititi had restylized the franchise to become more of a joke-infested comedy as well as a CGI-saturated epic adventure. It was funny at random moments with a few unexpected celebrity cameo appearances, but the constantly comic approach was maintained at the expense of the convoluted Asgardian adventure storyline. It also meant sacrificing the heart that would have us empathize with the fate of the principal characters. Chris Hemsworth still plays the title role in the manner born - though the rest of the cast felt somewhat less committed to their roles, even Christian Bale as the malevolent evildoer and Natalie Portman returning in superhero form as Thor's love interest.

","In 2017, Taika Waititi wowed theatres with his revival of Thor in Thor: Ragnarok, and once again audiences have been wowed. Yet, this time in Thor: Love and Thunder, it is due to the disappointingly weak thematic use and character development. Firstly, the film starts off with an incredibly arrogant and selfish rendition of Thor, which after his development in the series is clearly out of place. Not only did Thor recognize his mistake and recover from his grief in Avengers: Endgame, his journey started with Thor (2011), which had the entire plot focused on recovering from his selfishness, pride, and arrogance. Furthermore, the other characters were practically nothing. The main antagonist, Gorr the God Butcher, performed by Christian Bale, was a delight while on screen, but sadly that was for such a minimal time that the threat and intrigue of the character practically didn't exist. Then, there's Dr. Jane Foster who takes the form of Thor wielding the previously destroyed Mjölnir. Again, she is underdeveloped on-screen and lacks the substance to even be an important part of the film. To even greater disappointment, the movie lacks any substantial or valuable themes, greatly due to Thor's poor character development. Throughout the film, Thor struggles with having someone to love and the loss he experienced with his ex-girlfriend Jane; however, he never grows throughout the film and continues to make selfish choices. Although in the end, he accepts a father-like role to Gorr's daughter, there is no grand revelation or growth in his character.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

I liked ragnarok, but this was just bad. And is Taika to blame? No, not always. I think it mainly the way marvel works that is to blame. Because the story is boring, the CGI is so bad i just immediately cringed at it, the humor is bad and there is a feeling of emptiness. Wait a minute, isn't that how all marvel movies nowadays are? Yes definitely. I remember i disliked the background in avengers endgame, it looked so fake, and i thought it was a one time thing, but ever since that movie, every background looks fake. The CGI has gotten even worse, and THOR LOVE AND THUNDER just hits an achievement: the worst looking MCU movie ever. And c'mon, can someone tell me which movie in phase 4 had an interesting story? And humor has always been a dislike of me in the MCU. So many unnecessary jokes in emotional moments. And yeah, feeling of emptiness? Mostly present within phase 4. So is thor a drastic change of quality? Nope, phase 4 has already proven its quality is gone. You know what I also hate? The middle part of the movie where the promising, new surprises are set up for future movies. We already saw it in Doctor Strange multiverse of madness. In the middle part we saw the illuminati, who halted the main story, purely for the purpose of giving fanboys something exciting, like a cameo, something that shows something for future projects.

","The franchise remains in Waititi's assured hands as he becomes the first director to helm more than one film in the series, unfortunately it seems like he's trying to use much of what worked in Ragnarok while at the same time trying not to totally repeat himself. Thor is still without a clear path or plan, but must take action to thwart the machinations of a madman (Bale, who deserves a lot more screentime) out to butcher all Gods. Thor also gets a blast from the past when he reunites with old flame Jane Foster--now bonded with his old companion Mjolnir. Even after three previous entries there's still a lot to work with here, but so many of the key characters are mishandled, the bulk of the comedic bits fall flat, and the ex-lovers chatter gets tired oh so quickly. After a promising opening the movie stumbles into tonal uncertainty as it veers between silliness and seriousness but never convincingly establishes what's at stake or manages to feel consequential. It's redeemed somewhat by the fantastic visuals and a third act that's pretty good, but the unevenness of the finished product and the limited use of so many great characters makes it curious as to what was left on the cutting room floor. **½",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

1212,3 February 2023,dalyons-09311,6," Decent but Messy
","I liked it. The ending of Ragnarok and the bulk of Infinity War was peak Thor, so since Endgame didn't do the character any favors, I was looking forward to another movie where we saw Thor be epic and fun. And this movie didn't disappoint...for the first five minutes. Perhaps the biggest problem with this movie was the pacing. Despite being heavily focused on in the trailer, the Guardians of the Galaxy were gone pretty quickly. We go from one scene to the next, never spending much time anywhere. It's a short movie, too. Because of this pacing, a lot of the movie didn't get the time it deserved. In the opening scene, I loved that they were adding depth to Gorr's character and showing his backstory, but then we don't really get to see him do anything besides be a shadow until the end of the movie. I'd like to see the god butcher butcher some gods. The rumored deleted scenes would've helped a lot. The ending was also very quick. For the first hour and a half of the movie, everyone's making a big deal about how unreachable Eternity is, but then Thor and Jane make it there (separately) in about 5 seconds each. And clearly Thor didn't learn his lesson in Infinity War to go for the head, because after they defeat Gorr, they let him walk into Eternity and get his wish. And now he's raising a demon child, and she gets Stormbreaker while he gets a broken hammer. It's all so rushed and forced. Also in that ending scene, this movie suffers from the Last Jedi effect where it has moments that are super cool and surprising on a first watch, but then immediately become stupid once you think about them. It makes sense that Thor's able to give the kids the power of Thor since Odin was able to do that...but why didn't he do that against Thanos? Or Hela? Brings up so many questions. Aside from the pacing, the inclusion of Jane wasn't great. I don't like watching exes argue about who left who. I also think that the fact that Thor cursed the hammer to protect her means she wasn't actually worthy, which makes her transformation into the Mighty Thor completely meaningless. In addition, due to the comedic tone of the movie, her absence in the previous movies, and the notion of Valhalla and the multiverse, her death wasn't impactful at all. Speaking of which, the movie went way too hard on the humor. Humor in Ragnarok was necessary because the first two Thor movies were extremely stoic and often boring, so an overcorrection was necessary to make Thor fun. But once you've accomplished that, you balance it like the rest of the movies do. Instead, Taika made it even funnier, which is fine, but it makes it feel disconnected from the MCU. No Way Home knew when to be funny and when to be serious, but no other phase 4 entries seem to. Stormbreaker being jealous was really funny, but that kind of tone makes it hard for me to take any of this movie seriously, which is odd since it involves dead children and cancer. That's not to say I didn't like the movie though. Jane's hammer usage with the split parts was extremely cool. Giacchino's score was incredible. The desaturated shadow world fight was beautiful. It was a fun, action-packed movie, but the poor pacing and messy writing muddled the experience.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

","Thor: Love and Thunder is the story of how Thor teams up with a few of his old friends to go after a group of modern day Viking children that have been taken to a different realm by character known as Gorr. Reprising his role as Thor is Chris Hemsworth (Rush) who meets up with his old girlfriend Jane Foster played nicely by Natalie Portman (Black Swan) who as we learn at the beginning of the movie - and unknown to Thor until much later in the film - is dying from cancer. Rounding off the lead cast are Tessa Thompson (Creed) who plays King Valkyrie and goes to war with the group against Gorr played by Christian Bale (The Dark Knight). Writer/director Taika Waititi rounds of the lead cast as computer graphic character Korg's voice a strong, charming character that seems to go way back with Thor. The action in Thor, the movie as I will be calling it for the rest of this review (and yes I will differentiate between the people), is absolutely outstanding!! They combine realistic fighting with computer graphic fighting and make it look very real which is very satisfying considering this is a sci-fi movie!! The humor in this movie is outstanding!! Of all of the independent Avenger movies, Thor probably is number one when it comes to one liners or just Thor's own line of thought when they let him muse. All of the different sets - green screen and otherwise - were outstanding!! This is the type of movie that takes us places, you feel like you really get your money's worth if you paid to see this film!! Director Taika Waititi did an outstanding job directing this film - characters are where they should be on-screen and the action is smooth!! Waititi, Jennifer Kaytin Robinson, Stan Lee, and Jason Aaron all contributed nicely in some way to tell a compelling and satisfying story!! Michael Giacchino and Naomi Melumad did a fine job with the orchestral soundtrack to the film!! Mayes C. Ruben did an exceptional job designing the costumes for all of the superheroes and non-superheroes in the movie!!

Taika has seemingly gone into this movie without a lot of planning or preparation. The script is awful, boring, weak, with tone all over the place. This new chapter in the Thor series also throws all the past character development and lore out the window. I was so bored. While the movie was running, I was thinking of leaving, on my phone, and also wondering if I should ever return to the cinema ever again. Honestly one of the worst movies I've seen in recent times, and that's saying something because I've had to suffer through some real garbage. I suspect the crew think they made something wonderful. But I do hope at some point the word of mouth even gets back to them so they know they made absolute trash.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

Also the jokes are bad and the entire audience had like 8-10 laugh over the whole duration. Indeed the peak of the entertainment of the night was one guy who fell asleep snorling. Also the character development, which was a big part of Ragnarok, is nowhere to be found here.

Thor 4 is partially saved by the excellent performances from Chris Hemsworth and Christian Bale and a good first act. From the second act and then too much silliness in so little time, without it even trying to maintain any seriousness.

","Thor: Love And Thunder is simply my biggest disappointment of the year, so far?, i think it will stay until the end of the year, but who knows, anyway despite the usual great MCU movie trailer, for the first time i'm leaving the theater so disappoint on an MCU movie, Thor: Love And Thunder is basically an awful romance movie where the main couples of the film have a superpower, Thor is mostly just a full unfunny comedian here, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and Thor chemistry is awful and their dialogue is just so cheesy, their chemistry is also not click for me in the first Thor but it's not terrible, and their chemistry is good in The Dark World but i guess that because Jane Foster did not appear much on that movie and only have a few scene with Thor and i don't mind it, and so i can safely give a conclusion that Natalie Portman as Jane Foster is just not good, Christian Bale as a villain surprisingly awful, Gorr is just a lame unbadass villain, he's not scary for me and he's not menacing, it is possibly MCU worst villain, from Ragnarok to Love And Thunder this movie is a super downer, if it's directed by different person it's still make sense but no it's still the same guy, Taika Waititi, in Ragnarok you got this version of Thor who are mostly still a badass just with a little bit of comedy and it works perfectly, a badass female villain Hela played incredibly well by Cate Blanchett, you got Loki which is one of the best thing in Ragnarok, you also got bruce banner, and the fight and the battle was fantastic, in this one only the first battle and the battle in Zeus place that i enjoyed, the rest is mostly a meh battle, i also wanna say that Lady Sif played greatly by Jaimie Alexander is probably MCU most underused and underappreciated great characters they've ever have, and she only have a very very small role in this one, much smaller role than she have in Thor: The Dark World, i love Lady Sif in the first Thor and Thor: The Dark World and not only i want her having a way longer screen time in here, and i also way much prefer her than Jane Foster, i think she deserve on the main team alongside Thor, Valkyrie, and Korg, and they did not do that, MCU really use her character so terribly, now let's talk the pros of Thor: Love And Thunder, the movie still have a few pretty good moments and the whole Guns N' Roses soundtrack that i like, i think the visual and special effects was great, Valkyrie and Korg was not awful in this one, they were ok, the last battle was also just ok, and that's about it, the rest i just can't stand it, so overall Thor: Love And Thunder is for me MCU worst film to date.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

","Reviewers need to top applauding Christian Bale's performance. I'm a big fan of the source material and Gorr was absolutely destroyed by Bale, with Taika Waititi opting for him to look like a budget extra from a Star Trek movie to I feel please Christian Bale, because Bale feared he would be wearing a g-string? I believe either Taika was starstruck by Bale or Bale much like Cruise used his star power to yes, no what his characters role demands of him. His bipolar performance was only terrifying in how bad it was, jumping from sad dad to storytelling clown to bland villain back to sad dad. Gorr is am absolutely terrifying and driven character yet the film never portrayed that, or any God killing bar the intro and one shot from the comic page opting again for the cheap trick of conveying Gorr's campaign of terror to thousands of distress signals? Cheap. If anything this should have been two films, Gorr had zero menace built and Jane's storyline was poorly delivered, the Guardians should have featured more than just in an intro. Peter Quill, Thor's one friend, who lost his mum to cancer is written out when this storyline could have been used to build their relationship like Bruce and Thor in Ragnarok, as the supportive friend helping a friend prepare and deal with loss. Most of all, the humour just felt forced and Korg overused. Don't get me wrong there was a lot I loved but minor visual details do not make a great movie, that's like sitting through Revenge of the Sith just to spot the E. T aliens in the senate scene. I honestly think this is one of the worst Marvel films but you can't always have an unbeaten streak, I still love Marvel despite falling asleep twice, while drinking coffee to this. Natalie Portman looked fantastic as Mighty Thor, Russell Crowe as Zeus was hilarious, I just wish we got the film we really deserved. Alarm bells for me were triggered when months in advance before release after seeing Bale in an interview claiming to be unaware of the MCU's existence, so I feel being disappointed was expected and it delivered that, in spades.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

","'Thor: Love And Thunder (2022)' feels like an absolute rush job. Seriously, it's like a half-hearted first draft. Lacking the charm, wit, wonder and chaotic energy of Taika Waititi's previous foray into the MCU, the film chugs along at its own meandering pace as it tells a simple story as straightforwardly as it can. Some of it has a lot of potential and some of it is even fairly good, but all of it is undercut by the almost oppressively unfunny screenplay that has no idea how to balance its tone. I could probably sue for neck injuries thanks to a couple of these instances of total tonal whiplash. The movie just isn't fun, either. It certainly isn't the sort of devil-may-care comedy you may expect from those involved. Despite a handful of jokes that I recall making me think ""that's quite funny"" (but, crucially, never making me laugh), the experience of watching this is a maddeningly straight-faced affair. I mean, it's like the easiest 'you laugh, you lose' challenge in the world, so much so that most of the humour doesn't even seem like it's trying to make you laugh even though it obviously is. The whole thing is actually kind of embarrassing, the equivalent of watching a screening of someone's University work that they clearly scraped together mere moments before they were due to present it. I'll highlight the few things that I feel work about the picture. Firstly, Jane's storyline has a lot of potential and comes close to being affecting on a couple of occasions. It unfortunately isn't capitalised on fully, but it's undeniably the heart of the story and brings the chemistry between Natalie Portman and Chris Hemsworth back into the fray. Secondly, Gorr's motivation is believable and his presentation is often fairly unsettling (thanks, in no small part, to the stellar work from an out-of-place Christian Bale). His introductory sequence is mostly stellar, until it eventually gets too silly for its own good, and the payoff to his arc is as mature as it is satisfying (despite the denouement's somewhat clumsy handling of its consequences). Finally, there are a couple of action sequences that are presented with distinct aesthetics that bring to mind the best work of Zack Snyder. The golden shower skirmish is probably the movie's most entertaining set-piece, whereas the gang's extended stint in the shadow realm builds on the flick's most disquieting scene to present a relatively eerie battle that's genuinely aesthetically interesting. Despite these limited successes, the picture is easily one of the worst in the entire MCU. Much like 'Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness (2022)' before it, it simply doesn't feel like an actual film. It has all the elements that ought to make for a strong superhero story, but it squanders each and every one to emerge as nothing more than an absolute mess.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

The plot unfolds with a slow opening of a tragic survival story and the introduction of a new menace threatening the universe. Then the story uses a juvenile-level narrative flashbacks and adds a romantic dimension along with the threatening menace which by the end of the movie becomes like Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness a strong redeeming climax that helps to greatly lift the overall assessment of the movie. For those unfamiliar with these characters, a number of well-known actors offer up some surprising, disguised performances, perhaps credit to their acting abilities and make-up, except for surprise appearance of Matt Damon (uncredited) whose presence is almost always impossible to disguise. In sum, Thor is an enjoyable, summer romp that does not break any new ground, but Chris Hemsworth makes great use of his light, comedic lines. Mostly tame, off-beat almost overly cute humor along with the typical fantasy action sequences describe this movie, but it is the relational moments that shine.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

","This movie could have been one of Marvel's best. Sadly it missed the mark for a myriad of reasons. The comedy being one of them. I'm not at all opposed to comedy i actually enjoy it a lot. The first Guardians movie was a riot. But if you have a story about Gorr, a God killing villain who lost his daughter, and within that same movie a story about love and losing someone to cancer, let up on the damn comedy. Gorr's character and development was rushed. He's a God killer yet he only killed one God on screen. One that didn't even seem like a threat. They could have easily stretched this out into a trilogy and made Gorr a Thanos level threat. And to not show what the villain is capable of on screen and instead of showing the dead God in the aftermath of what happened kind of ruins any tension building with said threat. They could have built the story up over multiple films showing Gorr killing powerful Gods and at the same time Thor building a team to take him on. Such a HUGE missed opportunity. If they would have approached this film with a darker more serious tone and took their time with it it could have easily rivaled Infinity War or even been better. But sadly they threw in too much Disney and not enough Marvel. I really wish Marvel would put on the brakes a little bit and assess what they are trying to do moving forward. There are so many amazing projects coming out in the next few years but if they keep on with these lazy writing choices those projects are doomed from the beginning. Daredevil will not be a continuance of the much beloved Netflix series and from what i read will not even have a mature rating. I have serious fears that one of the best Marvel heroes of all time is going to be neutered like all the rest of my once cherished superheroes. It's really a sad time to be a Marvel COMICS fan. I know these movie are not comic books. But alas they are based on comic books.

Multiverse, wrong Director!!! I love Sam Raimi but this was clearly him going to Disney and Pitching Evil Dead 4 wrapped up in Dr Strange's cape....and then alas we come to Thor.... I'm sorry, but again....wrong Director.... Waititi nailed it with Ragnarok as he blended the right amount of comedy with a tonne of action and great soundtrack. Love and Thunder was nothing more than a childish comedy with a couple of superhero moments....not sure if Waititi was wasted on drugs making it but annoying goats, a ridiculous Zeus (Russell Crowe....what were you thinking)....

","There are a lot of complaints about this movie trying to be too funny. But this is the humour from Ragnarok, which sat very well and I actually found the humour a mild grace here (though far from a saving one.) Love and Thunder's biggest problem is terrible pacing and bad editing. Everything is cut together so quickly it seems to have no regard to building a narrative or giving any sense of challenge. It's hard to follow why any of the key plot points are happening and many of them have no consequence. Christian Bale's character is by far the most interesting and unfortunately unexplored while Portman's transformation comes unceremoniously and lands like a lead zeppelin.

","While it wasn't nearly as good as Ragnarok (and i know some people don't like Ragnarok), it is still better than Thor 1 & 2. I will say that i enjoyed the music they put in the movie (despite my hatred towards guns & roses). Christian Bale delivered a solid performance as you would expect and honestly the acting overall was good. I'm disappointed by Taika on this one because it seems like they maybe gave him too much control. It was basically a throw away movie to make money. And that's not always a bad thing but it really didn't do much in my opinion to move Thors character ahead any. The colors and shots were nice. Plot was maybe too rushed while also kinda throwing in scenes that were completely unnecessary. Seems like
most movies are shooting for 2 hours worth these days when it really isn't always necessary. Natalie portman is a bad actor i believe after watching this, but also could have to do with the fact that she doesnt really do cringey comedy much. As far as people complaining about how cringey the movie is, that's what it was made to be. It's supposed to be a mildly cringey 80s style Rom-com but it even kinda failed at the Rom-Com side. If the whole cast would've been killed by Gorr the God Butcher i don't think i would've felt anything. And that's the general feel of the movie, not a lot of feeling or heart put into it. Is it still worth the watch ? Well yeah of course but it's not gonna be a classic or anything and hopefully after the bad press for the movie, disney will get their act together. 6/10 if you consider Ragnarok 10/10.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

","THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER (C-) gives us a Thor struggling with an identity crisis (expressed through non-stop jokes) despite the challenges and growth his previous 8 appearances have sold us on. The film itself seems to be struggling with the same thing as it has transitioned to an all-out comedy vehicle with just two dramatic notes - love is good and religion is dumb. Taika Waititi's work here is like religious satire of Voltaire coupled with the schmaltzy humanistic ethic of Oprah filtered through the cinematic comedy lens of Tarantino & Shrek. The film isn't helped by a plot that is as engrossing and ad hoc as the obvious and non-stop CGI locations they travel to. Nor is it helped by action sequences as the film seems completely uninterested in taking the action seriously by giving it stakes or a respite from the non-stop comedy or unique/creative beats. I laughed at some of the jokes, but I found myself growing less and less interested in Thor and the gang that surrounds him. At the rate this universe invents ad hoc items (God killing swords and wish granting altars) that should have been mentioned in the Infinity War, brings back dead people, or retcons the tone/plot of past films - why should anyone care about anything.

","The first half hour or so has some funny jokes and pop culture references, starting off with a bang similar to the most recent Suicide Squad film, however, unlike the most recent Suicide Squad film, it completely loses momentum, and the rest of this film is utter, hammered garbage. Natalie Portman is fed an awful script, genuinely appearing uninterested in her role, and looks ridiculous as a female Thor - I literally pity her for having to appear in this filth, along with poor Christian Bale. If these producers had any actual brains, which clearly almost nobody working for streaming companies that make feature films does these days (Netflix is equally guilty of producing tripe features), when they read the proposed script and saw the name ""Zeus"" it would have been very clever for them to think to engage Liam Neeson in reprising his unforgettable performance as Zeus from Clash of the Titans, to the point that I might have given them one more crucial star towards a barely passing grade. Don't tell me Disney doesn't have the cash that this couldn't have been arranged, since Liam Neeson will seemingly work for loose change these days (not to detract from his work, he's excellent, but he appears quite easy to engage, similar to Nick Cage, who I also enjoy). Russell Crowe is utterly miscast as Zeus - his worn-leather face, stringy hair and obesity simply DO NOT CONJURE VISUALS WORTHY OF A GOD OF ZEUS' STATURE, PERIOD, to the GREAT detriment of that entire sequence. I'm surprised to see Christian Bale in such garbage, but none of the fault lies with him. The film has typically strong visuals (LITERALLY THE ONLY THING GOING FOR EITHER NETFLIX OR DISNEY THESE DAYS) but even the visuals are squandered, as mid-way through the film converts to black and white as they enter some sort of ""shadow realm"" thingy, and honestly, I feel they could have been more inventive making the visuals look good without using color. More routine, boring action sequences and bland storytelling ensue. Whatever, it's garbage, why am I making any effort going any further about it since Disney/Marvel didn't?

","""Thor: Love and Thunder"" (weak title explanation at the end) is a co-production between Australia and the United States and I guess the Australian impact here comes from director Taika Waititi and also lead actor Chris Hemsworth. Okay, Waititi is fom New Zealand, but close. You will find other English native speakers in here that are not American. The title gives it away of course that here we have the at this point newest cinematic addition to the Marvel universe. Avengers is through, but the franchise still keeps going of course with how much money it makes by luring people into theaters. Maybe this film was in advance considered a contender for number one in terms of money for 2022, but I doubt it's gonna reach that. It should have been a little bit better for that, but I am not sure. Have not checked these pages for a while that show us how much money a movie made. Anyway, I mentioned Waititi already and he is the director here as he was in the past with Thor and he (an Oscar-winning writer) got help with the script from Jennifer Kaytin Robinson and Stan Lee (rip) is listed again as well. I am not sure how accurate this is, but people love him still, so it makes sense. Chris Hemsworth is not just the lead actor here, but also a producer and if you take a closer look at the cast, you will find a few names that make this a bit of a family affair even, in terms of child actors, but also the Thor stage play we see once again here. Matt Damon was in it for that again too channeling his inner Loki. Interesting cameo again. In general, the cast is really top-notch. Natalie Portman plays the female lead, Christian Bale plays the main antagonist and Russell Crowe shows up as Zeus. I love the actor, but I am not sure how much I liked that.

Absolutely loved it one of the best Marvel Studio movies ever, well I say that every time but it is. A very eventful roller-coaster ride I loved every minute to ever second of it. Tons of laughter with Thor's goats ""AHHH"", Chris Hemsworth is so funny as Thor best guy to play the character and Taika Waititi as Korg brilliant an absolutely hilarious character so funny every thing he saids. The whole writing and production to the actors and actresses, and the director Taika Waititi so funny he knows how to get a lot of comedy in a action packed adventurous film buff especially a marvel film love him. Ever song fitted perfectly with ever fight scene best music ever they defo know how to pick the perfect songs the music department brilliant. Thor: love and Thunder is a serviceable entertainment that coasts off a game cast who could've done more. I don't agree what other critics and reviewers are saying that it's got a lot of resemblance to Thor: Ragnarok. The most humorous characters in the film were Thor Goats and where many jokes land and many do not amongst the triumphs it's a proper comedy detour to the home of the gods Omnipotent City. It's has the one of the best marvel villains and the most scariest Marvel Studios villains ever 'Gorr the God Butcher' (Christian Bale). All the CGI was spot on from the villains goons zombie like shadow creatures to the home of the gods to the really good part the shadow realm when it goes like (Monochrome) brilliant. Absolutely loved the ending tho not saying anymore but say to the end as always 2 credit scenes one post credits and after credit scene. My verdict Thor: Love and Thunder is more Waititi than Ragnarok. It's had a very good strong opening to the middle then to the end brilliant, and it's smooth and colourful to the very end and I loved how they kept true the the comics with one particular storyline for one of the characters of you don't know then go and watch the film now if from uk and in cinemas around the world July 8th.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

And this threw me out of the loop and probably why I wasn't heavily invested in this film like all of the other marvel films. The second act highlights thors antics while embracing in some cool combat scenes. When we meet Jane foster expect her to do every move while she's learning to fight for real against gor. Talking about Jane, the actor puts on a stellar performance next to Thor and even with her B plot she still sells the performance. Gor is a great villain and ones who's motives are clear from the very beginning but I still can not get over the skin tag (please change this for Disney plus.

","I thoroughly enjoyed this addition to the Thor franchise. It was campy but not cheesy. It was fast paced (not in a bad way). It was hilarious. The soundtrack was stellar. I loved the visual effects. Christian Bale gave a tour de force performance as Gorr. Russel Crowe completely owned his scenes. Natalie and Chris had wonderful chemistry. Tessa was still badass.

","For reference, Ragnarok was the right amount of seriousness mixed with comedy, like staring doomsday in the face and trying to think of some witty banter to lessen the stress. Love & Thunder however, was joke after joke, and each joke was beaten into the ground until you couldn't even tell it was once a dead horse anymore. Even the actors didn't seem to take any of their roles seriously (either because it was part of the script and they weren't thrilled, or they just wanted to goof around), aside from the two serious moments in the movie that lasted all but two seconds before they rolled in another gag. I don't know what the director of this movie was doing, but directing this movie was not one of them. It would've been a decent stand alone movie with different characters/franchise, some weird multiverse bit, an exaggeration by Krog considering he narrates bits of the movie, but this movie is a step in the wrong direction if this is canon to Earth 616 of the MCU.

","Having been a fan of all the Thor films prior- it really hurt to see how muddled, messy, and just completely useless this film ended up to be. What was the point of fridging Jane Foster? You took the effort and brought her back, just for her to be killed? Seriously? This film also just had so much going on it was hard to keep track, between Thor, Valkyrie, Korg, Zeus, Gorr, we are expected to be excited about so many little things showing up on screen and yet almost every single one of them feel incredibly underwhelming. The visuals prove to be nice at times, but that can also come and go- with the scenery being a visual marvel and some other CGI looking like it came out of 2007 or earlier. As someone who gave Marvel a pass for their lacking CGI in so many projects lately, it's frustrating to see them keep making the same mistakes over and over and now attributing far lazier stories as well. The script for this film is just a mess, none of the jokes really land, and it really only serves as filler for yet another continuation of Marvels next great lineup. There is no heart, despite how much it tries, and even the actors at hand seem to be putting far less into their iconic characters. The only one I can really shine light on is Bale, who always brings his most to every role he portrays. His character can be undermined by the lacking script , but the first few minutes of the movie with Bale is far better than anything else the film sadly has to offer. In the end, Thor Love and Thunder misses the mark. It's just a tired and sorry excuse for a film, especially when there is so much content produced just like it. It's not all hopeless, but for the most part-it's a forgettable blunder that only offers some visual and light remarks- and is far better left for dead.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

It even seemed to try and tap a daytime soap with melodramatic stagings. Maybe this is all due to Waititi and Hemsworth being unrestrained this time and unfettered from the Marvel restraints which helped to make Ragnarok a more perfect balance of comedy and drama and greater success. This was less than the sum of its parts and tried to do too much with too little, never allowing its audience to go with the flow. There are great performances and some brilliant cameos, for those who have loved Hemsworth's Thor history, but it lacks the cleverness of Ragnarok and ends up being clunky and a pale immitator of the Marvel movies leading up to Endgame. In trying to please everyone at all cost, this leaves a confused mess and bring the Thor greatness of Ragnarok back down to earth with a thud - where The Immigration Song was inspired in Ragnarok, too much Guns and Roses just led to a land of confusion, and a Universe that may have been blown by all the colour and lights.

","Massive disappointment from both the MCU and Taika Waititi. Feels more like a parody of Thor: Ragnarok more than a continuation to that movie. Waititi's style works incredibly well for his other films but here it's just too much. The comedy undercuts almost every emotional moment and deflates almost any tension in every scene. The character development here for anyone who isn't Thor is underwhelming. Natalie Portman returns as Jane Foster and she feels more like a mandate from Disney to include her rather than Taika wanted to. I also don't think Portman is doing a great job here but the script she is given doesn't help her at all. Chris Hemsworth is good as Thor. It's clear Hemsworth is having a blast and his charisma kept me somewhat invested. Christian Bale's Gorr is a very mixed bag. On one hand you have a really fun, engaging, and great performance from Bale but that character of Gorr just isn't great. His origin is rushed and confusing before the film bizarrely chooses not to show him kill any gods besides one. A character called The God Killer only gets to kill one god on screen. Great job Marvel! The other actors like Tessa Thompson and Russell Crowe are doing a good job but their characters feel like an afterthought. The filmmaking here in general honestly feels a little bland. Taika's style is there but it feels awkward this time. The visual effects don't look great most of the time either however with the recent news about how Marvel treats it's VFX workers and how little time they have then it's understandable why they look incomplete. The film wasn't completely devoid of anything fun though. There were some fun sequences and fun jokes though. The black and white fight is very creative and fun to watch and The Rock at the end was pretty great. The rest of the jokes in this film really aren't that funny though. The screaming goats weren't funny the first time and they weren't funny the 15th time they made the joke. With the lackluster output that Phase 4 has given us, Marvel is in trouble right now if they don't course correct soon.

And even playing a real bad guy in ""Bad times at the el royale"" he still can't help showing off that odd sense of humor and his fit body of course. Obviously not everyone likes these Thor movies and that is ok, but I do, and I'm not a big superhero genre fan. Though I don't like some of the flashing lights and stuff, but that was really only an issue in the first film of the series, which is why I rated ""Thor"" only a 5/10.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

Everything in this movie feels rushed, and seems half hearted, and unprofessional. The sad thing for me is that I really like everyone in this film, but I am not going to just give a positive review due to the personalities, instead of the performances. To me it seems like they were more interested in an agenda than entertainment, or doing the job the public expects them to do. This is my second submission I have made for this movie. Several of my reviews have been ignored entirely by IMDB. I cant help but think that any mention of wokeness, PC, and how the entertainment industry pushes an agenda automatically gets censored.

","Watching trailers for this had me excited. Considering that Taika Waititi is one of my favorite directors currently with movies like Jojo Rabbit and The Hunt for the Wilderpeople being genuinely funny while managing to be emotional at the same time, striking a strong balance between the two. Love and Thunder's predecessor, Ragnarok, fell neatly into this category, while not being as fulfilling or, in my opinion, quite as good as the other examples. Unfortunately, as soon as I saw the first god on screen, I knew this would be much different. I was, unfortunately, correct. This movie leans so hard into the comedy aspect that ragnarok brought to the table that there isn't any emotional payout to be had whatsoever. On top of this, most of the jokes didn't even land for me. Instead, they brought on an eye-roll or a facepalm, especially the 2012 screaming goats joke that manages to overstay it's welcome throughout the entire film. As a cherry on top of all of this, much of the action (one of the main selling points of a marvel movie) fell flat or seemed overly jokey, though I don't know what I expected. The only real saving grace I've found with this movie is Christian Bale's performance. While I don't think he fits the role very well or even wanted to be in this, I feel like he put up a good performance for the script he was given.

Who can forget Thor and the Hulk raging at each other and then sitting side by side, talking about their emotions and making up?

Together, they embark upon a harrowing cosmic adventure to uncover the mystery of the God Butcher's vengeance and stop him before it's too late.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

He does not go on a journey or evolve, instead it feels like a parody of the character. You have Oscar winner Natalie Portman coming back to play Jane Foster as The Mighty Thor with the comic story arch which should be a SOLID HOME RUN and the character is written as a joke, why? Last, the film has Oscar winner Christain Bale as the villain Gorr The God Butcher as he is barely in the film and like the other characters is written as a joke. It is one joke after another after another. I don't understand what the director was thinking. He has the budget, the characters, the talent in front and behind the camera and this is what was given? Taika (director) you are better than this!!!! Kevin Feige (President of MCU) where were you? How did you let this happen?? The film has its moments, but my God all the unfunny childish jokes take away from those moments.

","I had a great time watching this. It was fun and memorable. I liked the action, visually it was great with the color grading and cinematography, character arcs were pretty good with Thor learning to love again only to lose it again then find it in a child, Jane was really interesting and I liked watching her deal with cancer and I thought it was a good ending where she essentially killed herself to save the universe but she went to Valhalla so that was a good ending. Christian Bale did great with his performance being the selling point for his character. The story was really good, making complete sense and having lots of logic backing it. My problems are that I think the movie is too fast paced, at least in the first act.

As the movie briefly slips into a parallel realm of play and pleasure, you can feel the director Taika Waititi having a good time. It starts with a pasty, near-unrecognizable Christian Bale, who, having been relieved of his DC Dark Knight duties, has signed up with Marvel as a villain with the spoiler name of Gorr the God Butcher. Waititi quickly sketches in Gorr's background, giving it a tragic cast. Believing himself betrayed by the god he once worshiped, Gorr is committed to destroying other deities. It's potentially rich storytelling terrain, particularly given Thor's stature and Marvel's role as a contemporary mythmaker.

For a while, it's just goofy, and not always in a good way. The jokes largely don't land as well, and it takes a while before it really starts to get going. But when it does, boy it REALLY goes. It's a lot more serious than I expected it to be, and the vast majority of the comedy ends after the first 1/3 or so, after which it's just one fantastic scene after another. There's one part about halfway through where we are treated to probably the most visually unique scene in the entire series, and it blew me away. From that scene on, the movie just didn't stop for me and I loved everything from then on out. Christian Bale absolutely dominates and really shows Chris Hemsworth up in his own movie, which is saying a lot because Hemsworth is as good as always. But we've seen him before about a dozen times, while Bale brings a whole new energy to it. Speaking of energy, there's Natalie Portman's Mighty Thor.

","It was unique. I am really surprised to see the comments. Look at the action scenes, it was wonderful, where did we have such action scenes in the fantasy genre. Those who have watched long and boring series of this genre know what I am talking about. The film is miles ahead of all the films and the best adventure animations. See, it is not artificial at all. Even very big movies and series do not reach my feet. The movement of the camera was calculated. We have the peak of entertainment in a movie and we are also experiencing a work of art. All the characters in the movie are great. We don't have such a movie at all. It was better than beauty and the breast either. I enjoyed it a lot and got a feeling. It was a very well-made and strong movie. I never thought that a fictional film could be so strong and at the same time heavy. Or they can make it. I saw a movie once and the wonderful acting of the actors stayed in my mind. I usually do not like very serious and imaginative movies, so I enjoyed this movie. The acting of the actors is very serious and real, all the acts are correct. At the same time, jokes are included. The actress who plays the role of Thor, Natalie Portman, our actresses should learn acting from her. Christian Bale very serious and extremely good game. Enchanting script. Even mat damon plays well. The same sequence played by Natalie Portman is worthy of all the Marvel superhero movies. This movie has a special feature, which is that it has nothing to do with taste. It means that it was not made by measuring people's tastes and purposefully. So we see that even the most famous filmmakers of the last few decades use this feature. It couldn't be better than this.

I have never been a fan of Thor before Ragnarok and Love and Thunder takes it up a notch. I love Thor now. Guardians were a fun part of the plot which leaves rather early on. Jane and her story of becoming the Mighty Thor was properly based on the comics and she was really well portrayed by Natalie Portman. Now moving on with Christian Bale, woah he gave me the chills at moment, element of horror in the movie, especially the dark scenes like the black background one.

As for Zeus and other gods they were a fun addition like actual fun. We finally see a celestial being other than celestial in Thor love and thunder.

He truly did such a great job with the script, the direction of the film and with Korg! Also loved all the gay representation he put in the movie!

Valkyrie is a badass as always but we get to see a more vulnerable side of her too, which I loved. There's two things that kept the movie from being a 10 out of 10 for me. One is that I think they should have shown the exact moment that Jane became the Mighty Thor and not just give as the how and second that the movie should have been a bit longer because the first 20 minutes or so felt kinda rushed!

Thor could have stopped being a fool from the beginning to the end of the movie, more subplots could have developed. Instead the result is a noisy, sometimes cringe movie. The part with Zeus/Russell Crowe was also very embarrassing. Positive note for Christian Bale, but his talent has been wasted in such a superficial plot. Natalie Portman excellent in the role of the Mighty Thor; otherwise, the movie is enjoyable in small sections, but disappointing overall. MCU/Disney believe that using the same card (Waititi) just because a movie (Ragnarok) came out great, can guarantee success. Not really, you know? In this movie, everything is exaggerated, the comic tempos, the music, the jokes (endless, endless jokes ...) in the end aren't even funny anymore.

","Let me put it this way. I expected worse. Lately, Marvel movies haven't been reaching the quality they once did, so I wasn't expecting anything special, and that's probably why I'm not disappointed in the finale. It went by pleasantly quickly because there was a lot of action, which I thought was pretty epic in places, but there's just one catch. Story-wise, it's not such a joy anymore. There is a lot of humour. A lot. That's a classic with Marvel movies, but here there's perhaps I would say a little more of it. I generally don't like a lot of jokes in superhero movies. I prefer more serious superhero ventures, like Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, but that's beside the point. There were several times in the story where one character was speaking to tell the story and that bothered me. I don't like it much and rarely like it, but sometimes it's cool, but here I didn't like it. Then as I mentioned the humor is really over the top here, which wasn't my cup of tea either. I don't want to spoil, but story-wise it wasn't a total win either. Well it was saved for me by the aforementioned action, which I enjoyed and which Marvel can and probably always will, except for Eternals. That was pretty damn weak in my opinion and Thor: Love Like Thunder is still fine in comparison. So, for me, a good movie that although I would recommend to Thor fans, I might not after all because it gets quite the hate. It's hard to say. My friends were really disappointed with this movie.

","After Thor Ragnarok I had massive expectations from this movie as it was directed by the same director. Boy I was wrong. They dumbed down Thor so much and dude was cracking jokes every two minutes even during serious moments when a bunch of children were kidnapped. I think Ragnarok had a proper mixture of comedy and seriousness that's why it worked but this is mostly comedy and about 10% serious moments. Also they wasted Christian Bale as Gorr the God Butcher. For someone named Gorr the God Butcher he only butchers one God and the rest were shown in some screens aboard the Benetar. There was no sense of threat from him as we never get to see him in full glory. The movie felt rushed and the editing was poorly done. Only the story of Jane and Thor splitting post Ultron was shown properly. I heard the movie's original length was 4 hours and a lot of scenes were cut as Disney execs were adamant to keep the running time of this movie under 2 hours. That's why we got this movie clocking at exactly 1hr and 59 mins so that they can sell more shows per day. Just imagine if we had got 20-30 mins of Gorr the God Butcher actually butchering Gods and more story of how Jane becomes the Mighty Thor and her learning to fight using Mjiolnir and Lady Sif fighting alongside Falligar and failing to save him and where she has been post Ragnarok, introducing Heimdall's son early in the movie and not as a floating head, Hercules defending his father in the omnipotence city and not introduced as an after thought and some more Guardian's scene as they went to answer the distress call. All or some of these scenes would make the movie so much watchable instead of this jokefest that we got.

So, without further delay, I will give Thor: Love & Thunder (2022) it's just reward of 9.9/10.

","One of the best comedy and adventure movies. I think it was even better than Billy Wilder's comedy movies. Who's watching some of these movies, doesn't want to think about any other movie. To perfection You see, everything is found in this movie. The depth of the story, character, dialogue, rhythm, what else can a science fiction movie do. Dad, let go of the previous bulls, Martin was right when he said that it is a game city, it is different. This is a movie, now someone wants to think that it belongs to children, and someone will tell me why it was not like previous episodes. Marvel came out of its replica mode. Marvel is changing, but the change is not bad at all. It has not been successful so far, but in a film like this, I see that we are on the side of an artistic director who knows the language of cinema. The movie definitely has a direct impact not only on Marvel but also on the entire science fiction cinema from now on. But the important thing is that the movie itself has become a masterpiece. If we want to look at it objectively, we will hardly realize that it is a good movie and we have to watch it several times, but if we look neither objectively nor subjectively, we will realize that it is a masterpiece. From an objective point of view, this movie is not as memorable as a show, but with our second view, we deeply accept that the movie is either a masterpiece or it doesn't suit me at all. Enough of the weaving philosophy. Regardless of any asides related to previous Marvel movies, there are scripts here, not humble remakes of outdated sci-fi.

A problem some Marvel movies have, is placing comedic moments in the serious moments, I can assure you, this movie did not do that.

I didn't think too highly of this movie and I thought this movie was just gonna be a cash grab from Marvel. It was a cash grab from Marvel but I think it was pretty good and was better than I expected. I thought the movie was pretty funny, the 1 hour and 59 minutes seems like it is short but the pacing fits for this film, the acting was good, but nothing outstanding other than Christian Bale's great take on Gorr the God Butcher, the story was ok but it is too predictable. Something that I think would spice up the story a little bit was if Thor tried to get help from not just the Gods but everyone that he saved, but that just what I think. My favorite scene of the movie was when Thor is trying to call Mjolnir back to him while Mighty Thor is holding it but instead of calling Mjolnir back he gets Stormbreaker, throughout the Movie Stormbreaker seems like it is jealous of all of Thor's ex like Mjolnir and Mighty Thor and that was pretty funny because Stormbreaker is an Axe and I thought that was pretty unique that they gave Stormbreaker personality because in past Marvel films Thor's weapons usually don't have personalities so I thought that was pretty unique. Parts of the film I disliked was the CGI, it wasn't so bad to the point that you would leave the theater, but Marvel has impressed us in the past with better CGI, and how this movie had lots of CGI problems like Thor's gold and blue helmet, it looked so fake and I wonder why they didn't use a practical helmet, most of these bad CGI scenes were minor. Another part of the film I disliked was how there is no real stake, there is not a time in the film where it felt like they would lose, they try to make it seem like there is no hope and Gorr will kill Thor or whatever but it never really comes to that. This film was lacking in some things like a real sense of danger but other than that it was funny and I enjoyed the film compared to other Marvel projects.

Christian Bale was so creepy (like don't bring tiny kiddos level of scary ) but I loved him as the villain. Some of the heavy splaining backstory scenes recapping the Jane storyline were a little tedious but I understood why they did it (Thor 1 came out years ago, but w/ the recaps you didn't ""have"" to see it to follow the plot). The ending was super sweet and was fitting. ...

Thor is one of my FAVOURITE marvel characters and ONLY Chris Hemsworth can portray Thor in this exceptional way. So all in all I'm satisfied with what I got in terms of Story, performance, action, visuals and emotions.

2582,16 February 2023,dakotadickenson-83457,7," Definitely not Marvel's brightest hour
","So, I've struggled to write a review on this movie for a couple reasons. One reason being how I feel about the movie with my own pros and cons. Number two being other peoples pros and cons. It's been hard to put it in words how I feel about this movie so I'm just gonna do the best I can. This review will contain spoilers as using them will be the only way I can really explain my thoughts on the movie itself. First off, Christian Bale as Gorr the God Butcher, absolutely steals the show in every scene he is in. His character honestly had the potential of being one of the best villains ever to come to the MCU, if not for one thing. We don't get enough of his character like we were expecting. In total, he probably has only 30 minutes of screen time in this movie and his name the God Butcher doesn't stand for much, because he literally kills no gods on screen in this movie, other than the one he stabbed in the beginning. After the opening scene started and the Marvel Studio credits started rolling, I was hyped and ready for what was to come, only to be let down drastically. Chris Hemsworth as Thor the title character was good, but kinda goofy and not always making the smartest decisions in this movie. I honestly thought we would of gotten more of his character like we did in Thor: Ragnarok and Avengers: Infinity War, but instead we just got this goofy light hearted side of Thor that I honestly don't care if we ever see again. If I see Thor again in the MCU, he needs to be darker and have those elements that he did in Thor: Ragnorok and Avengers: Infinity War. If there was one character we got way, way too much in this, it's Taika Waititi's Korg. There were scenes in this movie that he had no place of being in. He was used way more than he should of been used, but if any good came out of it, we got to know a little more about him. Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie I felt we finally got to see a side of her character we haven't seen yet before, as she is now the new leader of New Asgard who is struggling to get by as the new leader and is still learning the ropes. In the end, it made me want more of her character. The standout character was definitely Natalie Portman as Jane Foster/Mighty Thor. Honestly if this would of been a stand alone film on her version of Mighty Thor and character Arc, I would of been totally in for it and it would of been better than the film we ended up getting here. Russell Crowe as Zeus was a okay character. I kinda wished we've gotten to seen a little more of his character and hoped the source material would of been a bit better than what was given to him. It was nice to see the Guardians of the Galaxy make a appearance, but honestly, they had no point in being in this movie unless they were gonna play a bigger role in this film like fans thought they were going to, but we just got let down again instead. Overall, it's a okay addition to the MCU, but definitely not it's finest hour as it's brought down by bad source material, Taika Waititi's comedic tone and has a waste of what could of been a great villain.

Visuals lacked any subtlety, nuance, or sophistication - the colours were just too damned bright, my eyes hurt after about 10 minutes; it's like the film-makers only understand how to use primary colours. Also everything just looked cheap, bad, and plasticky. For example the 'armour' they wore just looked like the plastic toy viking/roman costume armour that you get from the Dollar Store. While these devices may have worked for Ragnarok, I just feel that they went too far this time, like they thought ""oh, this worked on Ragnarok, let's crank it up to 11!"" I guess the only saving grace is Christian Bale as Gorr, who is sadly and criminally under-used, which might actually be a good thing because the tone of his character really didn't fit in with the whole hokey-jokey tone of the movie.

A little consistency would have helped this effort. I recall thinking that anything Waititi directs would be worth watching. Waiting for this to be available streaming is fine, no rush.

","This film was fantastic. It fixed Ragnarok's two biggest issues by introducing a far more compelling villain in Gorr, played with a truly frightening performance by Bale, and it didn't undercut the dramatic moments with humour like Ragnarok did. Love and Thunder isn't as funny as Ragnarok, because it focuses more on the romantic/dramatic elements, which were electric. But, the action is a lot better and the score is one of my favourites in the MCU. I also love that there's a lot of moments when we see the characters just being themselves, and it having nothing to do with the script. The action was surprisingly creative, the visuals were either very vibrant or very washed to juxtapose between Thor and Jane's lives (I liked that), and my favourite aspect was the score.

","Believe me, I'm not saying it emotionally, but it seems that Russell Crowe has been practicing his entire acting life to play these few minutes in this movie. You see how well it turned out. I thought his best performance was in American Gangster, but now I see that in this movie. Here he plays the role of the myths of Zeus. Chris Hemsworth has become one with his role. It's like he has really become one of the gods. The music of the film is the only flaw that can be criticized. Bill is the best role after Batmans. Or at least he played a negative role. Of course, it wasn't bad in the American psyche either, but there his role was more of a black comedy. That film was not very well defined, but here it copes well with the negative role. In Ford, against Ferrari, his role does not suit him at all. He did not belong to that movie at all, not that he is a bad actor. The climax of the film's masterpiece is the presence of the Asgardians in the gate of Zeus. Here we have so-called delicious inserts, like the movie Silence of the Lambs, with the difference that the history of this deliciousness has been used up, but here we are dealing with an original movie. The delicious inserts of this movie fit in the format and do not look ridiculous. As in the movie, Jodie Foster's name is mentioned to some extent. The peak of this deliciousness is the inserts we have of Russell Crowe's face. And performs a mythological role for us completely. The ending of the movie is also unique. Disney paints mise-en-scène very well. It seems as if he has done what he misses in making the best animation in this movie.

Where the jokes landed well in Ragnarok which had a nice balance, this time the occasional silliness is relentless for the sake of cheap laughs rather than in the furtherance of the plot or story. And it feels more like the Director having a party and inviting all his friends than a serious attempt to respect the character of Thor and what's gone before parody similar to the ""play within the play"" which also lands flat this time as it is recycled for cheap laughs And in the end, the viewer is left lost at sea as a spectator to all the party guests in an orgy of lame jokes wondering how the whole is so much less than the sum of its parts.

","I don't mind there being humor in these movies, but this just felt kind of looney, and not in a good way. I laughed at a couple of things but I didn't laugh that much at all throughout the movie really. And that makes the approach taken with it that much worse. And let me just say that the running gag with the goats was not that funny at all. I don't think there was one time where I was actually laughing at it, but I was amused by it once and then every time after that I was just like ""okay it's old now"". I liked the performances, and I think the movie mostly looks good for the most part (although I do think these movies are starting to look the same now). You got Christian Bale, one of the greatest actors in the world to be the villain. I don't like how he was used here. Bale was great, but Gorr the Butcher was a disappointment. Taiki Watiti said he was going to be the best MCU villain ever. I know that's the kind of thing that directors say about their own movies, but I at least thought he was going to be one of them. I understood his motivations, but as a villain, he didn't really do anything. He was hardly in it. The ""god-butchering"" took place off screen. And Russell Crowe was a cartoon as Zeus. Honestly, as much as I love the Guardians of the Galaxy, they didn't need to be in this either. They were used to be part of the set up concerning what Thor was going through but I'm not sure if they really had to be. I feel like they just did it so that fans can get a whole hype train going before the movie comes out and say ""oh the Guardians of the Galaxy are going to be in too!"" and then they're in it for like 5 minutes or so. Speaking of them, let the Guardians of the Galaxy be the Guardians of the Galaxy. What I mean by that is I feel like the direction that the Thor movies are taking are because they want to emulate the success of the GotG franchise. That franchise deals with humor better though because it feels baked into the personalities, whereas with this movie it brought things to a halt at times. This movie needed more balance and nuance. If this is what we can come to expect out of Thor movies going forward then I'm not really looking forward to any solo outings with the character, even with what the mid credit scene suggests.

Aside from the unnecessary episode with the Guardians of the Galaxy, it zips along through the narrative challenges and nicely balances the love with the thunder. Chris Hemsworth is one of the most engaging actors stuck in the action genre, especially when Taika Waititi is giving him opportunities to play the goof. Christian Bale turns Gorr into one of the more complex Marvel villains, and it's good to see Russell Crowe loosen up and have a ball playing Zeus. I have mixed feelings about Natalie Portman's performance as Jane: She does a good job playing the diminutive foil to Thor, but I never felt the necessary chemistry in their love affair. Thor seems more enamored of Mjolnir than he does of Jane. I don't know why Waititi needed to reprise the gag of the actors - Luke Hemsworth, Matt Damon, and Sam Neill - playing Thor, Loki, and Odin, this time adding Melissa McCarthy as Hela; it only overloads an already bloated excursion into Thor World.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

I think the gist of what Taika was going for gets through for the most part. Omnipotent City is a commentary on failed leadership, failed religion, fallen angels, corrupt deities who have brought existence to stagnation and misery. The ending finds Gorr and Thor trying to make sense of this revelation, this disappointment (Thor with Zeus, Gorr with his god who he slew earlier). Together they rediscover what is meaningful again, without the guidance or inspiration of their respective idols or gods. They realize that what is most meaningful was inside them all along- the capacity for love and, thus, sacrifice and heroism.

","Don't get me wrong on this review. The movie was fine, but i saw so many lost opportunities. The history line was great and there were some amazing actors that could have made the movie so much greater. It was really a lost opportunity in so many directions. Christian Bale is a great actor and one thing that I liked, was that only his character brought ''realness"" to the movie. It was only where he was part of the scenes where u really could not take the eyes of the movie. His character really was made out of a good reason and it lives space to think. On the other hand Nataly Portman as Jean Foster was a great fit and she portrayed so well the character. But the downfall of the movie and what needs to be fixed in the next ones was the parody. There is nothing wrong when fun moments are added during the movie, in my opinion is better because it gets your attention but should not be overdone. From the beginning to the end it seemed more like a parody and not in a good way. Was totally disappointed in this direction. There were of course really funny moments but mostly is was over exaggerated. So many important and powerful scenes where wasted and were turned into jokes. It made the move feel very very commercial. Like a strategy only to attract the audience and taking it further away from being a good movie. It seemed in many moments like I was seeing Deadpool (but not in a good way). Deadpool was a successful movie of course but this doesn't mean that you have to turn every marvel movie into a parody. It looses its meaning. Thor is not a parody movie and please keep this in mind in the other ones. Was really excited to see it, but when I left the cinema I was totally disappointed. It really looks like the only intention was to win money and the content was not important turning it 100% into a commercial movie.

I love the guardians, they're probably my favorite franchise in the MCU, but they did NOT need to be in this movie. They contributed very little to the ""plot"" and were completely out of character in the little amount of time they had in the beginning, and then they just left!

","This film
I enjoyed it much more than Multiverse of Madness which isn't a very hard accomplishment to achieve in all honesty. The film was very funny and Christian Bale's performance is the main strong point of the film. He definitely carries the film on his shoulders, his presence is so dominating and steals the spotlight from the protagonists Hemsworth and Portman. That is where my praise ends. Although comedic that's all it has going for it as the action scenes and plot are sub par, predictable and frankly don't have much depth to them. This film continues the trend of tearing down Thor from being an incredibly strong hero both physically and writing wise, completely turning him into a clown who's only purpose is to entertain the spectator through his comic relief. This change in attitude to characters is a trend I've noticed with the Marvel Cinematic Universe at the moment. They take a once serious and 3 dimensional character and create this weird amalgamation of complete goofy and ridiculous nature with just enough of a serious edge to care about them slightly. Some audiences may actually prefer this style of Thor but I certainly do not share that view. To conclude I only recommend watching this film if you enjoy the current MCU releases.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

Gorr was wasted and felt like a very superficial villain. Most of the stuff I liked about Ragnarok was just not in this movie. While I feel Ragnarok fixed the character, this movie ruined him. I was initially intrigued at the inclusion of Jane Foster as mighty Thor but I found myself very unsatisfied with her scenes and her death felt very rushed. I liked multiverse of Madness a lot but I had many problems with the movie with many of those same problems being very large in this movie. Zeus was a positive I had with this movie, I liked the scenes he had but I wished there were more.

","TLT has received mixed reviews upon release, with praise directed at the visuals and performances and criticism towards the screenplay and overuse of humor. I fully understand people's complaints about the humor but I still had a great time with this movie. At times, it does feel like a spoof of Thor, which does undercut the movie's serious moments(which it does have a few of). However, it's just hard to hate a movie that I saw with my loved ones and put a great smile on my face. And let's talk about those aforementioned performances. I wasn't sure what I'd think of Lady Thor, Natalie Portman did very well in the role. And while it was nice seeing Thor and Jane reunite, the real standout here was Christian Bale as Gorr the God Butcher. He was extremely creepy and intimidating, which is a slight departure from his performance as the caped crusader but a welcome one nonetheless. If you're looking for a fun time, go see this movie, but if you thought the humor was cranked up too much in Ragnarok, then you definitely won't like this one. Overall, I rank TLT above the first two but not quite as good as Ragnarok. Rating: 7.5/10.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

It felt rushed and could have used way more. For instance, I would have liked to have seen more backstory with Gorr but also more with Jane as well and what she was up to with her cancer diagnosis and all. Another thing is they should've actually showed her initial transformation into Mighty Thor, they had to have filmed it, I know they filmed it.

General rule: Don't lose your charm when you're in a hurry to meet the deadline. It's true! A lot of great storylines go unnoticed, which is a shame because they're some of the most interesting parts of the MCU. Thor is a likable character, but the sequels didn't do him justice. He has a good arc of growing arrogance to humility and humor.

","This movie is about an alien who thinks gods in Thor's world have let him down but it's also about the main character. Gorr is the main villain who wants to kill all gods and Thor wants to stop that from happening. Gorr doesn't need a lot of movie time to be creepy and threatening to gods. We hear about his destruction and see the aftermath. Thor looks for other gods to help fight Gorr because he is has a sword that makes him as strong or more than the gods he's killed. Jane is back and has the same comic story but she isn't taking over for Thor believe that or not. Valkyrie is back and ruling Asgard but it's not a big part of the movie. Thor gets Jane and Valkyrie to help fight this powerful enemy. The Guardians of the Galaxy have a small part at the beginning and Peter gives Thor some advice Thor really tries to use. Korg the rock alien is part of this. If you like him you should like the movie. If not then it will probably make you think it's worse than Hitler. I don't know why some people really hate this.

Like several others have stated, the movie felt more like a comedy than having a lot of depth. Everytime the film began showing emotion, it would quickly break it up with jokes and such. It was funny in parts but I feel liked it sacrificed character building just for the sake of laughs. I love Valkyrie, but I am really dissapointed how they use her character mainly for comedy and they don't take her seriously. It seemed the only character that wasn't repeatedly cracking jokes was Gorr. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy when movies don't take themselves too seriously, but it ended up being too much. I wish I could have gotten to see and learn a little more about Gorr, and watch his journey as a villain. It seemed like we didn't get to see a lot from him, and it almost felt like there wasn't any serious danger throughout the film. Obviously there was, but it was covered up so much with comedy it never really left room to feel the conflict the characters were going through during the film if that makes sense. I liked the Jane storyline in this movie, and i'm not even gonna lie I even got a bit emotional during it. But I wished they could have done a little more with it because it felt a bit rushed. The entire movie kinda did, and I think there were some pacing issues. I appreciate what Waititi had done with the thor movies, and i think he considerably helped them. Although I wish the movie could've had a bit more of a serious tone, especially with the content it could've focused more on. I would definitely watch it again, it's kind of a fun watch. But it's kinda upsetting to think what they could've done with the film if it took itself a bit more seriously.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

","Continues the tradition of MCU movies being the most bland, cookie-cutter snoozefests they have all been recently.

The plot falls apart with even the smallest amount of thought (why was Mjolnir killing Jane, why did Gorr change his wish at the last second, why was his wish not always going to be to save his daughter). Thor has been turned into a walking punchline, zero character his own other than to be a vessel for jokes, I thought after endgame kept his depressive episode we'd see some insight into him as a character but that was dropped offscreen in order to give him a ""character arc"" in this movie. Gorr was absolutely wasted, accomplished nothing, changed nothing, if Jane was going to die because of Mjolnir, what did Gorr actually contribute to the story. If removing your primary antagonist would in no way change the outcome of the story they were not an impactful antagonist. Brief moments of some really stellar acting from Bale are wasted on a completely wasted, one and done character who really should have had time to develop. For a brief moment I was excited as actual stakes seemed present with Korg's ""death"", but that was quickly lost with his ""revival"" and the lobotomy of Zeus. All-in-all, what could have been a great story about growing past your pain has been turned into an extremely generic action flick, which seems to be indicative of this phase of the MCU.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

It's fun to see Thor's interactions with the Guardians of the Galaxy and great to see him fighting back from the rock bottom he hit between Infinity War and Endgame. Chris Hemsworth does a lovely job of depicting Thor as a superficially oblivious heroic meathead, while giving us glimpses of the character's underlying vulnerability and brittleness after his world and family has been systematically destroyed.

","Last we saw Thor Odinson (Chris Hemsworth) in 2019's 'Avengers: Endgame', he had relinquished the throne of Asgard to Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and set out with the Guardians of the Galaxy to chart his own path. Now, in 'Thor: Love and Thunder' (his fourth solo film), when a vengeful man (Christian Bale) with a serious grudge against the gods of the universe begins killing them off one-by-one, Thor must part ways with the Guardians and put an end to the slaughter. This time, however, besides King Valkyrie and rocky sidekick Korg, he has an unexpected new ally fighting by his side in the form of ex-girlfriend Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) who, by wielding his former hammer Mjolnir, has become the Mighty Thor! Thor and Jane's relationship takes center stage here, as this film is essentially Marvel Studios' first romantic comedy, and director/writer Taika Waititi (returning from 2017's 'Thor: Ragnarok') and co-writer Jennifer Kaytin Robinson breathe new life into said relationship and truly make you want to see them get their ""happily ever after"". Chris Hemsworth's and Natalie Portman's chemistry is great, and I cared about these two more than I ever have before. The comedy was pretty hit-or-miss for me, but thankfully most of it landed. It's just as silly as its predecessor 'Ragnarok' (perhaps even more so), but there are also some really emotional moments that balance out the silliness. Unfortunately, the story does often feel rushed, and definitely could've benefited from being a bit more fleshed out. However, I absolutely LOVED the ending! I've also seen some criticism about the film's CGI, but everything looked real and convincing enough for me, so I have no complaints about it. The cast is a delight, and Hemsworth's Thor continues to be a highlight of the MCU, but Portman's Foster and Bale's Gorr the God Butcher really steal the show. Jane/Mighty Thor is such a likeable character and is impossible not to root for, and Gorr is honestly one of the creepiest, most unsettling movie villains I've ever seen, yet he's also sympathetic because of his motivations. We sadly don't see as much of the latter as I would've liked though, and I wish he had a bit more screen time. The film is also amplified by a rockin' soundtrack full of some of Guns N' Roses' greatest hits. Overall, 'Thor: Love and Thunder' is a heartfelt, fun, and enjoyable rom-com adventure, and a worthy inclusion to the MCU.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

The first five to ten minutes of the film are a good setup to the villain and why he wants what he wants. But, it all goes downhill. The first God Gorr meets leaves a weapon that can kill him lying around, which is a bad idea. Gorr isn't allowed to be a genuine threat, only killing one God on-screen. The film also squeezes in too many jokes, about which 90% of them fall flat. There are times to be funny, and very few of these were appropriate. The dialogue is extremely cringeworthy and some of the characters (like Korg and Valkyrie) serve no purpose. The film also deals with complex themes like losing family, kidnapped children, and cancer, all of which are serious topics, but are thrown away for laughs. The Guardians could also have appeared for more, but Taika said no and did the dumb. He's a great director, and films like Ragnarok, Jojo Rabbit, What we do in the Shadows, and Hunt for the Wilder People really show his talents. Russell Crowe's accent is also bad.

","It was entertaining at times but the first have was definitely over-bearing on empty 12 year old comedy just to tone down the serious moments and/or cover up lacking character arcs. What a way to waste some potentially great characters and actors. Natalie Portman really could have delivered well with the jane story-line but they gave her entire role a comedy aspect to it?? I know it ties to old thor films but those films didn't work so this was the chance to really change her character around and they failed majorly. What happens to Jane is still interesting and probably the second most interesting arc in the film but they tone it down horribly. As for Bale? Not only barely in the movie but they also severely watered his storyline down. Although, he actually delivered on the performance. Two of some of the best Thor storylines really just tossed in the trash shoot. Every other character was also horribly utilized and I would have been okay with Thor's repeating character arc and goofiness if everything else in the film was turned up a notch. Or actually given creative and serious thought. I will say the moment they entered the world where Zeus and all the Gods were till the moment where the black and white scene ends, my eyes were glued to the screen. They were good getaway scenes and had the action comedy, romance, and entertainment I was expecting. Thor questioning the Gods himself and Jane's one serious moment, it looked creative specifically the black and white scene and Gorr actually seemed like a Villain I wouldn't want to go against for a minute. The comedy was paced in much better in these moments and in general It was the only effective scenes of the film. I would call it the middle act, whereas it is squished inbetween two other acts that were pointless, lazy, rushed, and all-around ineffective. The new character at the end seems like they could be interesting in the future but made the character that brought that character into the film feel even mire lazy. At least Multiverse of Maddness actually put in effort in the all around story, the comedy was in the back seat, and most sequencers were entertaining; it was just the writing that was weak.

","I saw TL&T last night & it seems clear to me that Marvel Studios are unable to recreate the excitement of the Infinity series. The films will continue making money because fans will go see them out of loyalty to the brand & to discover more of the puzzle pieces rather than them being good films. There seems to be a lot of focus on the multiverse & magic but I'm not getting the sense of an ominous theme like the Infinity Saga. L&T is also let down by its 'humour' while Ragnarok was IMO the best Thor film with regards to tone, humour & characters, this one fell pretty flat. The same issues arose, namely the side characters proving to be far more interesting than the main. Thor, like Spider-Man is great as part of an ensemble film, but in solo films the character and stories prove to be dull. Hela stole the show in Ragnarok even though she wasn't in it nearly enough. Like wise Gorr was a really interesting character, not evil by any means but complex due to his origins. There needed to be more explanation as to what & how he became like he did. All the intesting parts of the story were left to throwaway lines with mystic origins, those stories were far more interesting than the frankly dire representation of someone going through mental health problems.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

3119,18 September 2022,wahdmsyhy,10," Taka waititi is an artist
","Taka Waititi, I will never forget your name. You are a real artist. The classic Thor adventure takes place in a humorous and balanced context. Everything indicates that there is some kind of perfection in this film. Imagination is experienced in a completely enjoyable way. But the key of the film is Gore and his characterization which makes the film even more high. We have less here than ever, certainly less entertainment and more art. Less than ever because advanced entertainment tools are not used according to the audience's wishes, and when we say that we have a work of art here, it means that we are actually facing a balance in their feelings and romantic characterization. It is really the best joke that we can give an example in the history of cinema. Taka Waititi is a stylish director. And having a style is an important thing that makes the image form and uniform. The story does not suffer from false emotions that destroy the entire structure of the story. I mean, it doesn't deviate from the beginning of the movie to the end of the movie. And that focus is what Taka Waititi has perfected. Even in the great stories that we read from classical literature, for example, this focus is not present in the entire structure of the story, and this point is very important. There is drama from the beginning of the film to the end of the film and that is what makes this film a masterpiece. And again, we have to consider that we are watching a Marvel movie. And the ground for doing such work is hardly prepared. Another thing is face painting. The facial expressions of the characters in the film stimulate our senses in a wonderful way and serve the script. Taka Waititi has won an Academy Award and several Emmy Awards for hit series. But clearly his best work is this movie. No matter how many times we see the movie, we are caught by more things. And this means depth. Artwork must have depth. I always keep this point in mind that the work of art must have depth. Not by flipping the script and creating artificial complexity in it. The depth of a work of art comes from a complexity that is not artificial. For example, in this movie, the three main characters deepen the story. The rhythm of the film also gives depth to the film. Chris Hemsworth adds emotion to the film. Natalie Portman gives it a deep sense of humor and Gore balances it. Everything in the film becomes form and there is no trace of defects in it. Let's face it, Marvel needed a change. Now the She-Hulk series had an excuse. But why should such a movie get so much hate for no reason. It's not just about Marvel fans, hitters have a problem with work form.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

By virtue of his design, Christian Bale's deliciously hammy performance, and the delicious shadows swirling around him, I couldn't keep my eyes off Gorr the God Butcher. I could listen to this villain talk for ages. He and his plot take our heroes to some of the most visually creative locations and set pieces we've seen in the MCU thus far. When set to the great Michael Giacchino's score and a perfectly-fitting hair metal soundtrack (lots of Guns 'n Roses with a dash of Dio), you're fully whisked into a world that could only happen in comic books. It's just a notch below Ragnarok due to the occasional leap in logic (one in particular towards the end comes out of the blue). However, this is for sure on par with Thor Odinson's best adventures. Taika Waititi was born to direct this lovable himbo space-Viking. I can't wait for the next classic-rock science-fantasy trip.

Christian Bale was amazing but was in a completely different film. His character was totally wasted here. It felt as though they made two movies. One poor effort at a comedy and one powerful superhero movie and mashed them together. But they got the balance all wrong. They've made thor into a parody of himself. He went from a god to a joke.

","I've always loved Norse mythology. Their gods and cultural beliefs have always intrigued me. Thor is one of my favorite Norse gods so these movies about Thor have always resonated with me. Everything about the trilogy and now this one. I was always at the edge of my seat in this movie. I like Taika Waititi's vision of Thor. He's interpretation of the character is a breath of fresh air in the MCU. This makes the god of thunder very relatable. Truly an enjoyable film, in some ways it felt different from most MCU films, and while it didn't turn out to be as groundbreaking to critics as it's predecessor, it proves to be the perfect superhero movie for the summer. Many others before me say that it didn't have enough story, but let me tell you what it lacks in a ""stellar"" story it more than makes up for in action, humor, outstanding visuals, pop culture references, cameos, and overall creativity. While I was a little surprised not seeing Gorr do as much god butchering on screen, Christian Bale makes up for the character's limited screen time through a powerful and albeit creepy performance, one scene in particular reminiscent of Pennywise from It, and his powers are unbelievably awesome. My only real complaints is are there is too much focus on the love story between Thor and Jane Foster, the first part of the film feels somewhat rushed (though I did enjoy the action packed '80s style fight), and of course without Loki, it just didn't feel the same. Best of all, the mid and post credits scenes make me optimistic for the future of both Thor's story and the MCU overall. My complaints are few and my thumbs are all the way up to the heavens to join the gods themselves 😇. Highly recommend this film, and please, don't worry about what others think, go see it and make you're own opinion ;). Also, Russell Crowe as Zeus was both powerful and hysterical, respect for holding the Greek accent 👍I loved every second of the movie and I hope the MCU will rivit us with more amazing works.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

Can you imagine the uproar if they pulled off that same scene with one of the female characters? How about we just don't do that stuff with anyone. Don't get me started with how fast Korg became annoying, sure I understand maybe the first part of him narrating Thors life but when it happens over and over and over in the movie it becomes unbearably annoying. I cannot understand for the life of me why Marvel thinks they have to make some crude or annoying joke every five seconds in this movie none of them are even close to funny and make you cringe. Hey, look they turned Thor into even more of a bigger idiot then he already was, I don't know how they pulled it off, but they found a way. For 99% of this movie's plot, it was to find Gorr and save the kids and bring them back to ""New Asgard"" as soon as possible, but guess what?

Oh, and yeah by the way Heimdall I guess has a 10-year-old kid which Marvel decided to tell us just out of the random with no backstory whatsoever. Out of all the movies I have seen in my lifetime I have only ever walked out during the movie twice, this being one of those times, I was not only bored halfway through, but I was annoyed beyond imagination with the crudeness and inappropriate jokes they have to make every other line. How in the world they managed to make a love story out of a magical hammer and axe I will never know, easy the dumbest story line I have ever seen. Just in case if you were not annoyed enough let's add two screaming goats to the cast (which is too loud for a theatre). This movie is crude, it's annoying, it's boring. If you want a 2-hour comedy then this is the one for you, if you are looking for a great immersive superhero movie then this is as far away from that as you can get.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

","Let me preface this by saying I am not a Marvel movie hater. I respect an enjoyable superhero film, and I was a large fan of Watiti's last Thor endeavor, Thor: Ragnarok. To keep things short and simple, I'll start with what most people were likely looking for in this Summer blockbuster. Love and Thunder has a notable amount of laughs, but is nowhere near as funny as its predecessor. Many of the jokes feel mild and lack buildup, so there isn't any genuine hilarity, short of a scene or two. The fight scenes in this movie are equally mild. There is a visually interesting fight scene at around two thirds into the film, but if you take away the way colors are used in the scene, it is a very generic fight. My biggest qualm with Thor: Love and Thunder was the disappointing climax; the final fight in the film felt small-scale and low stakes (more on that later). Everything shown in the final fight is done bigger and better in previous scenes in the film; ultimately, the most suspenseful battle in the movie is the one in the early moments of the film. Everything after that fight seems like a downhill slope: increasingly smaller and with lower stakes.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

Thanks to this director, Thor's character has remained a buffoon, he constantly tries to make jokes out of context and the image of an epic superhero has faded. The script doesn't make much sense and it seems like it was written by a child. At times when it should be serious, they put some comedy out of place to force you to laugh. It's good to laugh from time to time but when dramatic scenes come they don't captivate you as they should be and you even hope they're going to throw another silly comedy at you.

This colorful mess of a movie should not be a Marvel entry. The God of Thunder is one of the strongest and most feared deities in ancient Norse Mythology, and Marvel's portrayal of him needs to be closer to the ruthless warrior people he represents. The Thor we see in this movie is a domesticated, apologetic wimp. It makes me wonder who the MCU is catering to. I dare say, the majority of the fandom have little to no knowledge of the source material and won't spend money on seeing this type of movie. The colors were overexposed, the plot was only so-so, the writing was bad and I will not even dive into the extreme sexism in the Zeus-scene. The comedic reliefs were lame, while Christian Bale's Godbutcher was genuinely undervalued and wasted.

","I want expecting much from this latest Marvel installment because they have been steadily declining in quality and this movie continues that downward direction.

The only value for the whole film was the lines that made me laugh. But after a while, it became distracting and redundant. Additionally, the insistence of the director to bring the woke agenda to the forefront, and this film ends up as a complete joke--unworthy of it's predecessors.

It was promoted to be another thor movie were he finds who he is in the world but this is not that. It's a fun Taika Waititi flick that doesn't have a huge toll in the MCU. I honestly think it's not a movie to be criticized but just rather experienced. Giving a point to this movie is kinda unnecessary because it is not even taking it's own plot seriously. I really think that Christian Bale as Gorr is one of the more deep villians in the MCU and a character that should appear as a jester amongst gods because although he is poweful he is blinded by love and when he's weak, he begs for merciful acts in both the comics and the movie. I think it was pretty funny and so did the theater, the dose of the comedy is ok, maybe a little too much at times but it doesn't bother me. I really liked the small details like Nick Fury being misspelled on Thor's phone as Nick Furry or Korg's boyfriend's name being Dwayne, a reference to Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock. I am well aware that Ragnarok set the bar high for this movie and that is why most people were dissapointed. Honestly i think if there was no Ragnarok before this it would be received a lot better.

","To preface I am a massive fan of Thor and the characters development from the first Thor to Thor Raganarok. Ragnarok gave us a refreshing new look at Thor in a comedic yet thoughtfully appointed way. So naturally my excitement for Taika Waititi's second installment in the Thor series was immense to say the least. However, after watching the film its hard to say that the movie was anything but a misguided sci-fi comedy filled with corny jokes and a wayward plot that felt like it was written by Lennie from of Mice and Men. The plot jumped from scene to scene with little to no explanation of what's actually going on. The movie felt crammed and void of any sort of depth what so ever. I legitimately think you could have made four different movies from this one film and they all would have been infinitely better. Not to mention the absolute waste of an incredible villain. The character Gorr the God butcher had so much potential, but lack of character development and childish plot destroyed all hope for this villain. Even with all the stupid jokes flying around this ridiculous movie Christian Bale still managed to give a good performance as Gorr, and is the only reason this movie is remotely enjoyable. Thor Ragnarok drew the perfect line between comedy and a meaningful plot filled with beautiful character arcs that actually contributed to the overall story. Thor Love and Thunder spit on that line while crossing it. This movie felt like Talladega Nights set in space, but with worse jokes.

","The perception of ""Love and Thunder"" as a zany comedy is the problem; it's actually a serious, even sad, movie about loss and redemption just masquerading as a comedy. But that's the point: masks, masquerades. Waititi is taking the entire superhero genre down and smashing the ""gods"" within. When you get the seriousness of that intent you see the movie entirely differently: Jane's appearance as Mighty Thor masks her deadly illness; Thor's show-off persona is totally false, masking his broken, lost, true self. The gods - as personified by Zeus - are inward-turning frauds hiding from their true callings to protect and defend, and possibly deserving of Christian Bale's (brilliant) one man death squad. The sum of all this? Love alone will save you. So not ""Ragnarok"", not even close in artistic intent. All the ""very very disappointed"" reviews are possibly still looking at the veneer, at the masks of the genre. I have to fault the marketing of this as a zany comedy which has led to the disappointed expectations. But it's a serious film by a director with serious concerns about age and mortality.

","First of all I would like to say that this movie definitely deserves a higher rating... Does is deserve Best movie of the year? Of course not. Will the actors/actresses be receiving an Oscar for their performances? I highly doubt it. But does that mean it's a bad movie and that Taiki Waititi should be receiving all this hate? If you ask me Waititi did exactly what he was trying to set out to do. This is an Action-Comedy very much like the previous installment Thor Ragnarok which received very much praise. It had its amazing action sequences, maybe one to many corny one liners, a familiar but good story, and a great villian (Christian Bale can't fail). Chris Hemsworth did a phenomenal job as always. There isn't anyone out there who could take this role from him. Tessa Thompson was great even though she didn't have as much screen time but that was to expect with the return of a very special someone. When I saw Natalie Portman was taking on the role as the Mighty Thor I was very quick to jump to conclusions. I thought it was a horrible idea but Marvel once again proved me wrong. It was great seeing her back in action and glad she reprised her role once again as Thors one love Jane Foster. At the end of the day we got another follow up with the characters we have grown to love over the years with a lot of action, laughs and heartfelt moments. Now I am no critic myself and I haven't liked the recent movies Marvel has put out including Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness but this one just doesn't deserve all the hate. Just because a movie isn't original and takes itself serious the entire time doesn't make it a bad movie. This is a movie about superheroes... Let's say that one more time.. SUPERHEROES!!!!!

Let's just say that the writers of Love and Thunder did not pay attention because they broke pretty much all of the rules (in a bad way), producing this hot mess of a movie. The script is awful, Jane becoming the Mighty Thor relies on total randomness not previously set up in the universe, the tone constantly shifts between over the top violence and comedy, and the characters are not serious people. Christian Bale as Gor tries throughout the film but even he cannot save this movie from becoming a self-parody.

The action sequences were good, Christian Bale and Russel Crowe were fantastic, but the seemingly nonstop need to pack joke on top of joke, often at the expense of the movies more serious tone with Gor the God Butcher being a genocidal maniac, brought it lower than ragnarok in my book.

","Taika Waititi did a fantastic job at transforming the Thor solo films from forgettable and dull to the lively fun and enjoyable Ragnarok. Whilst this drastic change was very welcomed at the time, the idea for this film , including the casting of Christian Bale who is known for his intense and serious characters, doesn't match Waititi's style. The film had very contrasting scenes so close together, going from the wacky comedy the director is known for to very dark and intense ones straight afterwards, then vice versa all too quickly. Bale did a phenomenal job as Gorr, safe to say he is the best marvel villains to come out in phase 4 yet overall the film was too goofy for such an intense character as Gorr. Chris Hemsworth also did his thing and wasn't let down by his performance and Portman's character Jane Foster is no longer the boring side character to add a little spice. Sadly, although I love Korg, he had too many corny jokes that came quite tedious and a legthy amount of screentime for a side character especially compared to Valkyrie which was a shame as Thompson is great.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

I've seen most of the marvel movies and definitely prefer the more light hearted entertaining movies like guardians of the galaxy, so if you like those then you will enjoy this one.

4095,10 July 2022,penguinator-31522,1," Probably the worst movie I have ever seen.
","I came into the movie not being pretty neutral towards it, I was neither exited or thought it was gonna be trash. The movie started okay the very first fight scene with the music was pretty solid honestly, Thor jumping up and then coming back down looked really goofy and kind of bad but the rest was pretty cool until he was in between the two vehicle things holding them apart with his legs it ruined the flow of the fight because the scene went from being pretty cool to it being funny, and after that fight the movie kind of just downward spirals into becoming complete trash. Maybe I'm no the audience for the jokes but none of them in this movie where funny (I'm 17 idk if I'm the target for the jokes.) their was one or two which I laughed a little at but when it came to the tens of other jokes in the movie I either cringed or just didn't find it remotely funny, I did laugh quite a bit but almost never at jokes just cause of how dumb some parts of the movie are at times. Next reason is Amy Shummer is in this movie, thankfully not for long but she is here which was painful to see the only way the play scene could have been more of a waste of time and painful to watch was if James Corden ran on the stage to say something funny. Thank god he didn't or else I would have died from the cringe. Now back to the plot, Jane Foster just gets to wield Mjolnir? I haven't read the comics maybe that is how happens their, and if it is then it's still a pretty trash way to do it. She just says later in the movie, oh Mjolnir was calling to me, why? Why is it calling to here? Seriously is their a reason that is explained outside of this movie or did I miss something like why does it call to her just cause dated Thor years ago? Honestly just trash storytelling. Next is why is Zeus such a pussy like come on he was told that their was a decent threat to the gods just running around and was either scared or lazy I don't remember precisely, but like why all he has to do is tell the god, ""Hey, guys lets get the thousands of us and spend a couple days going to this guy, kill him destroy the sword and then won't have to worry even a bit about any of it and we can live peacefully with no potential threat of any of us being murdered."" Seriously if they just did this they might, and even this is pushing it, loose 1 or 2 gods. Ok so who cares Zeus doesn't even have to risk his life, he can tell the other gods to deal with the problem. This plot point of Zeus not wanting to deal with this problem is the worst part of the movie. It seriously baffles me that this is how it went down. A better way to do the whole city of the gods scene to confront Zeus would be, they go their and find out a ton of gods where slaughtered by Gorr because they were lazy and unprepared to fight and it's down to just a few gods like 4 or 5 with Zeus and their all terrified. It would make at least more sense and my way of doing the is kind of trash because at that point they should be scared so they are willing to fight to try and save themselves, but this way is far better than how it goes down. I honestly think this is one of the worst plot points I have seen in any type of media. Now for the rest of the movie, their is just so much pointless talking that I just couldn't care about at all this was a problem in the previous parts of the movie but after the Omnipicity scene it got way worse, In a good movie exposition is used to tell you important things that affect the plot or ongoing storyline, I don't think any exposition did that in this movie. I damn fell asleep from it being so boring, that should not be happening, a movie shouldn't be so boring especially a mainstream movie for just your average person to the point were I'm falling asleep. Now for the end of the movie Thor just seems weak as hell like when Gorr has them held by the tentacles or whatever your telling me he isn't able to even resist slightly at all, the dude is frozen their until Jane is almost choked to death and then he calls Stormbreaker. Also I don't think a movie could possibly build less suspense than this one for the final scene I was not worried at all for Thor or the children's lives and I was completely right because they all came out fine damn near without a scratch. Now for the very end of the movie why did it take so long for him to make his wish to Eternity like seriously bro had a whole like 30 seconds to say it but he is just chilling their until Thor is like ""yo bro bring your daughter back because love bro"", then Gorr is like ""damn bro my bad that is a great idea my g imma do that."" Then he brings his daughter back and dies right after. In conclusion worst movie I have ever seen, best parts are the songs, all of the songs used are great songs and went well with what was going on especially that first scene, using Welcome to the Jungle made the scene pretty hype.

","WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD
I've been lucky enough to watch this movie twice now so I think I can express my opinion about it in a somewhat coherent way. I know it's got mixed reviews online but I think the movie has done what it's set out to do- align Thor's character development. Ragnarok saw Thor losing most, if not all, of what he loved- Odin, Asgard and even Mjolnir- and propelled his character in a new, fresh direction which is why it was so well-received by fans (and me too, it's my fav MCU movie). I feel that Endgame, however, set Thor's character back in terms of characterisation and development so this movie had to pick up the slack and sort of re-route it to a better path. It also provided context to Thor and Jane's backstory, propelled it forward and ultimately gave an end to that plotline.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

I also liked the villain's backstory and how he did a full circle as a character.

If it was just action movie after action movie, you all would still hate Marvel and would complain they have lost their sense of humor. To me this movie actually felt whole, at the end the movie felt complete, unlike some other marvel content thats come out recently (i.e. Falcon and the winter soldier, multiverse of madness, and even moonknight). Thor has never been a serious character and we have to remember that, he is supposed to be silly. Similar to Shakespeare's plays Thor is the jester/the clown, he is there to break up all the darkness and distress. The first Thor movie was not serious either and guess what: the bad guy in that was a f'in tin-man! Gore is much better. My only criticism is that I wish they fleshed out his story a little more, showed him kill more gods in person and made it a little more, pun intended, gore-y.

I hate to break it to most of you, but superhero comics (and thusly their movie counterparts) were always meant to be geared toward about a 12-14 year old.

No, the movie wasn't perfect and no, I'm not advocating for false positivity- but the sheer amount of hate I've seen for this movie seems very hive-mind generated. Like, shut up, oh my god. Maybe it's because I'm a woman and therefore my superhero movie opinions are automatically wrong (ha) but.... This fandom is starting to feel like Star Wars.

","Ragnarok was one of the funniest MCU movies, some would say it was the saving grace of the movie. The opposite is true with Love and Thunder. Not a single joke landed, not due to poor chemistry or delivery, but a feeling of forcefulness ruins each joke. It feels like Waititi heard the praises of his last movie and decided to run with that and that only. It doesn't work with this story. Balancing screaming goats with a lead who is dying of cancer is not a good idea. The greatest compliment to this movie I can give is Bale's performance as Gorr. Bale is terrifying, entrancing, and unhinged all at the same time. This greatness from Bale almost is a detriment to the rest of the film, as the tonal clash between the different plots is genuinely distracting. Nothing was more disappointing than Russel Crowe's character Zeus. I was stoked to see what angle they'd take with Zeus. Instead he's just a minor inconvenience on the way to Thor's inevitable victory. Hemsworth and Portman's chemistry is better than it was in any other Thor film, but that isn't saying much. The actors are giving it their all, and I don't blame them in the slightest for the outcome of the film. Instead I blame the 'comedy' writers who overkilled their roll in the writing process.",/review/rw8373605/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Love_and_Thunder_2022

Before looking at it, I remember very well thinking that they could not do worse than the 3, and well yes.... Thor Love and Thunder had an exceptional cast and enormous means to succeed in making a film that would have marked the Heart. But they managed to lay us the worst Marvel movie I can remember. We are used to Marvel movies not being cinematic nuggets, but they have hit rock bottom here.
