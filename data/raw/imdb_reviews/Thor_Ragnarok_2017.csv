0,23 February 2020,MrHeraclius,," Best Movie in THOR series
","The cast for Thor Ragnarok are all matched well, and the sibling chemistry between Tom Hiddleston and Chris Hemsworth is as natural as can be. Cate Blanchett as Hela, the goddess of death is frightening in her cruelty as well as physical perfection. But, the reason this movie stands alone is the multi talented Taika Waititi, the director of the film. His offbeat New Zealand style shows in every scene, humor throughout and a rocking 80s electronica soundtrack, the film will transport you as fast as Heimdall and the Bitfrost!",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

2,27 October 2017,ctowyi,8," This Thor is Thor-some!
","Frankly, I didn't like the first two Thor movies, the game plan was so clear from the get go. Same old ""save the world"" routines, brooding hero with a burden, a love connection born out of necessity and bloated battle scenes. It is the same blueprint for many superhero movies, but Thor has the God element that made the stories feel even more preposterous and ridiculous. It is hard to be vested in his quests because God don't die, hurt as much and can always employ one last deus ex machina that solves the unsolvable problem. But Thor: Ragnarok throws that over-used game plan out from Bifrost into an unknown territory, making it this year's best superhero movie. I know I know Justice League has not descended, but looking at the trailer it doesn't take a genius to see that it will be doing the above-mentioned routine.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

4,22 October 2017,TheLittleSongbird,10," Thor and Marvel Cinematic Universe are at the top of their game
","Really enjoyed the first 'Thor' and loved even more its bigger, darker and bolder follow-up 'Thor: The Dark World'. 'Thor: Ragnarok' manages to be the best of the three, and is not just a strong contender for the funniest Marvel Cinematic Universe film (yes even more so than the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' films) but also one of their best to date.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017
5,29 October 2017,Troy_Campbell,9," Popcorn-blockbustering of the highest order.
","Being the 17th instalment into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), and the third in the solo-Thor series—generally the least liked within the MCU—it wouldn't be surprising if this cosmic adventure showed signs of repetition and fatigue. It doesn't, not one bit. The opposite is true in fact, thanks to the unique energy and ingenuity brought from New Zealand director Taika Waititi (Hunt for the Wilderpeople, What We Do in the Shadows). Waititi's comedy background is noticeably in full swing, the previously darker Thor outings traded in for a laugh-heavy vibe closer to Guardians of the Galaxy – the movie Ragnarok shares top spot with, as the MCU's funniest film. A throwaway gag about scissors from a side character made of rock (mo-capped and viced by the director himself) is pure Waititi, and the franchise's best one-liner since Chris Pratt's Starlord appreciated the artwork of Jackson Pollock. Of course a big budget means big action, and there's plenty here to thrill and delight: a tone-setting smack down of a fiery underworld demigod, a bruising gladiatorial contest between Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), an exhilarating spaceship chase, and the breathtakingly electric finale. This threequel is visually distinct too, Waititi opting for a grungy-disco 80s atmosphere over the more theatrical opulence of the first two Thor flicks. His use of slow-mo, backed to Led Zeppelin's 'Immigrant Song', for two key moments, is simply brilliant. Supporting Hemsworth, who has never been better as the macho God of Thunder, is Tom Hiddleston as fan favourite bad-good guy Loki, Cate Blanchett as the sneering God of Death Hela, Tessa Thompson as the cocky warrior Valkyrie and Jeff Goldblum as the eccentric Grandmaster, plus a raft of awesome cameos. A few minor nit picks: Idris Elba seems bored as the returning Heimdall, two previous major supporting characters (both females) are conspicuously absent, a talking Hulk doesn't quite work, and the narrative-retcon work could've been more subtle. But when a movie is this damn entertaining, a few quibbles are easily forgiven. Comfortably taking its place in the top echelon of MCU films, Thor: Ragnarok is hilarious, invigorating and popcorn-blockbustering of the highest order.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

","There are two ways one can take oneself too seriously: 1. The Twilight Saga way or 2. The Dark Knight Trilogy way.

","In some alternate reality, a movie bearing the title of Thor: Ragnarok has taken itself very seriously indeed: full of literal doom and gloom, it's an apocalyptic drama about the End of Days, as prophesied by Norse mythology. Since that pretty much describes the world in which we currently live, it's actually rather fitting that Marvel's 17th studio film is something else entirely. In our reality, Thor: Ragnarok is a wild, wacky and very welcome blast of pure joy - a raucous comedy that fuses an intergalactic road trip with buddy comedy, brotherly rivalry and battle domes.

","Well for what it's worth, Thor Ragnarok is definitely a satisfying and suitable ending when speaking of this year's MCU movies. Despite enjoying Spider-Man Homecoming a little more overall, partially because there were things I didn't like about Thor Ragnarok but there was very little I disliked about Homecoming, all in all, this film is really, really good. It's explosive and fun and colorful and enjoyable and looks terrific and exquisite all throughout. Is it overdone? You decide whether or not they overdid some things for this one. I see lots of people comparing it to Guardians of the Galaxy and while I don't fully agree, I can definitely say that there are some things that are reminiscent of the Guardians' movies, but certainly not in a bad way.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

In Phase 2 we got some further world building in the different solo movies like Iron Man 3 and Captain America: The Winter Soldier.

","Okay so the first thing to note about Ragnarok, which if you have enough brain cells you'd guess yourself after seeing the trailer, is that it's nothing like the previous two Thor movies, beyond sharing some characters and settings. The tone is completely different. In fact it's probably better to compare Ragnarok to Guardians of the Galaxy with it's straight comedy angle and influx of neon colours and whacky concepts. This is the new world order for Marvel's Cosmic Universe in full swing. How this makes me feel isn't quite so clear. As I said, I really didn't mind the other Thor movies, and to see the brooding seriousness get thrown out entirely, particularly in a movie about the end of days, seems like a misplaced choice. That said this is what Waititi does best, and he's on top, What We Do in the Shadows form here.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

Sakaar was my favorite setting out of any recent Marvel films, with Jeff Goldblum giving a hilarious performance as a playful dictator and the arena-centric atmosphere providing an intriguing set piece.

","Thor must stop Ragnarök! It's back again: The Marvel machine. Pumping out more and more movies for you. This movie is what you expect. It's a fun, enjoyable party. It's difficult to hate it, because you realize the movie itself isn't taking things that seriously. This time around they are more self-aware than usual. I liked that addition. It's true that we are so many movies in and you question when it will get tiresome. But to my surprise they shape-shifted the franchise again and got out on top. I never expected that I would like a third ""Thor"" film as much as I did. It's unexpected, but I'm so glad they took some chances by not making the same movie again. If you've had a stressful week or just a bad day, then you will not have a good time watching something that's too dramatic. That's when something like ""Ragnarok"" steps in. It's a nice refresher. Forget your problems for an hour and follow Thor while he jumps around with 80s synth music. The first act is basically a classic ""Thor"" sequel. But things pick up as soon as our hero lands on Sakaar, and the film enters an edgy science fiction zone. It's funny, full of great jokes. It's distracting at first because its obvious how much the humor has been turned up compared to some previous chapters. I easily started enjoying it though.

","I saw this film at the Beckenham Odeon in London. The beginning of this film was as impactful as the bullet-time opening of Swordfish. So that set the movie off at with very high expectation indeed. Hela's part in the story was as expected, and nothing changed from the trailers. She's very powerful, and also very single-minded. Hulk's treatment in the film was in two parts - when he was the Hulk, he was a star, but when he was not hulk, he was a bit part player. I'm not sure I liked how his role was handled in the film, but I suppose anymore exposure of the Hulk, would have taken the shine off Thor himself. So maybe its understandable. I personally felt that more could have been made of the Hulk's character. What did make the film stand out though was the comedy. It was very unexpected, and also brilliantly done! Along the way, Thor meets a minor gladiator, who turns out to be the funniest guy ever! You'll have to see for yourself, but his deadpan delivery turns the film almost into a comedy, every time he's on the screen! The battle scenes were good, but not to the level of LOTR, for scope and spectacle. I enjoyed it, but I feel that it fell just a little bit short of the standard that Wonder Woman delivered. But it did set up the forthcoming space-based Marvel films very well (Black Panther was not referenced).",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017
59,27 October 2017,dave_maguire,5," My head is Thor
","I went in to this film maybe a little too expectant, I love Marvel, love the Thor comic character, and love the way Chris Hemsworth portrays him on the screen. However, this film is COMPLETELY different to every other portrayal of Thor and it doesn't work. Thor's comedy has generally stemmed from his failure to integrate with humans on earth, when he was on Asgard he was this regal, well versed, humble, albeit slightly cocky character, yet from his first scene you can tell the film is taking a completely different route with him. And this is where the main problem of the film lies. For a film called ""Ragnarok"", which is basically about the death & destruction of Asgard, there is too much of a light tone throughout this film and WAY TOO much ""comic"" dialogue - I put that in speech marks as a lot of the one liners do not work and fall flat, and this is purely because of the sheer volume of them in the film. Comedy only works when there is a straight man to work off, yet nearly every character in the film is written the same and thus loses their individuality. This is such a shame as it causes the film to lose all impact on the sad or serious moments. Within the first 30 minutes Thor discovers the Loki is posing as Odin and, instead of being A: amazed he's still alive, and B: He's somehow banished his all powerful father, he simply laughs this off as a little joke Loki has played, then when they find Odin and he subsequently ""dies"" just before they meet Hela, who then goes on to destroy Mjolnir, there is no mourning period and before you know it we're on Sakaar being treated to no end of electrocution jokes.(Though isn't Thor the god of Thunder and can summon lightning?? Why would he be incapacitated by an electric shock?)It's such a shame that, as Thor has just lost 2 of the most important things to him, this isn't given time to sink in or be dealt with and is just glazed over with a quick childish argument with the Hulk.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

","Unfortunately, it takes one of the most popular Hulk comic book stories ever, 'Planet Hulk', to make 'Thor: Ragnarok', the most entertaining 'Thor' movie yet. Honestly to tell you, the truth. It's a good thing. While, all three 'Thor' movies, have a similar generic premise, in which, an alien force is trying to conquer the Marvel Cinematic Universe with a super-weapon, with this one being Thor's lost-long sister, Hela (Cate Blachett), with Blachett doing a good job, playing sinister, sexy and deadly, even if her character come out of nowhere, unexplained. At least, this movie directed by Taika Waititi & written from a screenplay by Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost was a lot more memorable than its counterpart. I can hardly remember, 2011's 'Thor' & 2013's ""Thor: the Dark World' in the years, after both movies came out, at all. This one, honestly stands out. First off, most of the action, takes place, off-world, outside of Earth & the Ninth Realms, giving a lot more, bright & crazy looking, sci-fi vibe, mixed with its fantasy elements. This allow us, to get away from the annoying, human characters such as Darcy Lewis (Kat Denning) & Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), whom in the last movie, pretty much, phone her performance, in. None of them, return. Sadly, this also eliminates, the Warrior Three such as Hogun (Tadanobu Asano), Volstagg (Ray Stevenson) and Fandral (Zachary Levi), but at least, they had cameos in this film, even if short. Still, it cools to see that Sif (Jaimie Alexander) is still around. However, Alexander's absence in the film, does beg the question. Why, wasn't Sif in Asgard!? Nevertheless, this change in direction, allows new likable supporting characters to emerge, such as Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), who does a pretty good job & Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum) to shine. While, director, Waititi did an alright motion-capture performance for Krog, a gladiator that Thor befriends. His soft-spoken, Australian accent was a bit jarring for something that came from Norse mythology. The same goes, with Karl Urban as Skruge, whom machine gun mow down scene was really bizarre. Nevertheless, I love how the film is not so bog down with complex, confusing Norse mythology, as the other movies; giving more room for simpler story lines like a prison escape subplot to breathe. While, yes, the whole gladiator fight/revolution plot for the most part, doesn't mesh well, with the main 'Ragnarok' story, in which the movie is title, from. It's still entertaining even with big plot-holes like how the wormholes honestly works, why nobody use the tesseract to get anywhere and how Hulk got to Sakaar, in the first place. Nevertheless, it's cool, that Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is still the title character, not Hulk/Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), throughout this, even if it came from a Hulk comic book. The direction for this film, could easily be, misguide with Hulk getting revenge on the Avengers, but they stay focus on Thor trying to get back on his home world. I also enjoy, how the movie took more risk, with the title character. Seeing Thor, have short hair & without his trademark hammer Mjolnir was really shocking. Lucky for the writers & Hemsworth. Most of the risk paid off. Nevertheless, I can still do, without the badly gone, CGI eye injury. It was so fake-looking. It kinda distract me from enjoying the climax. The other special effects were good, but not great. While, none of the CGI in the film, look, deeply realistic. At least, it's beautiful to look at. It match well with the deliberately '80s space opera aesthetic and synth score, composed by new wave band, Devo's bandleader, Mark Mothersbaugh. Additional music featured in the film include ""Immigrant Song"" by Led Zeppelin and ""Pure Imagination"" from the 1971's film 'Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory' was also a nice tough. Another highlight from 'Thor: Ragnarok"" is the humor. It was really cheeky & funny, as it really was going for that, 2014's Marvel film, 'Guardian of the Galaxy', sci-fi comedy vibe. Hemsworth really look like, he was enjoying, playing Thor, this time. His performance really made the film, very fun to watch. I glad, he didn't get bored. Tom Hiddleston as Loki, was also nice to see, however, I really getting tired, of the heel/baby-face, working, together, vibe. It was cool in 'Thor: the Dark World'. Here, not so much. I really was, hoping for something new. Still, I did like the cameo of Matt Damon, Sam Neill & Luke Helmsworth, stage-acting out the climax of the last movie, to Thor & Loki. It was a unique touch. It's also cool to see, that Stan Lee is still around, at his age, doing Marvel cameos, as well. I hope that day, where he can't, never comes. Furthermore, along with the Easter eggs, film references, it was also cool to see, characters performers like Benedict Cumberbatch & Scarlett Johansson reprises their roles as Stephen Strange from the film 2016's 'Doctor Strange' & 2015's 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'. This includes, the mid-credit scenes. Without spoiling it, they really do help set up, 2018's 'Avengers: Infinity War', big time. Can't wait for that movie to come out! Overall: This movie deserves a thunderous applause. While, deeply cartoonish & somewhat childish. 'Thor: Ragnorok"" was a feel good fun romp fantasy escape movie. Highly watchable.

96,30 October 2017,alva3901,9," Marvel's most audacious film to date.... and it pays off
","Under the direction of New Zealand director, Taiki Waititi, Thor: Ragnarok is Marvel's most audacious film in their cinematic universe to date. Not only does it supersede the previous Thor films, but does so in the funniest and entertaining of ways. By far the most unorthodox character change within the Marvel universe, the new direction for Thor is pleasantly unique and sought-after, filled with Waititi's trademark humor and exuberance from start to finish. However, Thor: Ragnarok is more than just a comedic act. There are dark undertones that prevail throughout the core plot of the story, and the fundamentals of a superhero movie are all present. From the opening sequence, the action and visuals are on point, the quality never deterred for a second. And it has now become quite clear that Chris Hemsworth has embraced the role as Thor Odinson, showing off his comedic range and immediately making the character much more compelling than the darker and least fun of the Avengers that we were previously used to. In the film, Thor must prevent Hela (Cate Blanchett) from unleashing Ragnarok, the end of everything, and in doing so, must assemble a team to face her head- on and save the Universe because-as he quotes-""that's what heroes do"". The ""Revengers"" as he names them includes the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), ""his friend from work"", Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), a hard-drinking former warrior, and Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the mischievous brother who no- one should trust by now. And it is not a Waititi film without an appearance by the man himself, which came in the form of Korg, a hilariously voiced rock-monster who was the champion of cracking a joke whenever he popped up. Waititi's style of filmmaking is palpable to the point where it becomes evident that everyone had so much fun making this movie, that is carried through to what audiences were seeing. This is why Thor: Ragnarok works so well and is so fun.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

A mixed bag of fantasy, science fiction, jokes and action. And inner struggles are shown in a populist easily accessible way. But for movies like this there are no established comic heroes needed. Make such a script for a pure fantasy movie, so I know, I don't have to go for it. Fantasy is a colorful, conservative told tale without any vision. It does not add anything to its characters that may ring a bell in me or gives anything in meaning to my life. Pure entertainment. But from my comic heroes I am used that they mirror my own struggles in life. The uncertainties, the trying of love, the trying of being a good one, all the lost hopes, and the regaining of hope. The longing for being alone, the longing to be together with others. The best comic super hero tales bring me to tears. Give new insight. Let me struggle further in my own life.

Well, out of nowhere comes Ragnarok, which injects serious comedic energy through the veins of the franchise. This is a goofy, funny little acting flick. Not so different from Guardians of the Galaxy, in fact. It takes itself so lightly and I was thrilled to see that. Comic book movies shouldn't be so gritty.

","Ragnarok is the third in the Thor franchise. It is the sixth film featuring Hemsworth as the God of Thunder. It is the 17th entry in the behemoth known as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and the third one just this year. This game-changing series has been plugging along for almost ten years, with very few misses among their many hits. So what can I say new about Ragnarok? It's colorful, funny, epic, appropriately intimate, full of cameos and great performances, and way more entertaining than it is original. In other words, it's a fairly standard but similarly great Marvel movie. In it, Thor has to escape a gladiatorial planet with Hulk and Loki in order to save Asgard from being destroyed by limitlessly powerful new villainess Hela (Blanchett). In scope and plot, it's fairly common. However, there's so much goodness in the smaller stuff that makes the movie standout. Goldblum is wonderfully sleazy and charmingly despicable. The hang-out sessions with Hulk and Thor are great, like two petulant children fighting over who is cooler. The music is great, especially the use of Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song"". And each time the movie underhands superhero posturing with a needed comedic beat, I wanted to cheer but couldn't from laughing. So the movie is obviously a blast, but reviewing it is difficult for me. It's almost like having to review a single episode of a TV show. Luckily, the MCU is a TV show I love, and Ragnarok fits quite nicely within the quality of the larger universe.

","Thor: Ragnarok should be about the twilight of the Norse gods and the end of all things (or at least Marvel's version of it). It should be darker than the Dark World. It's not. In fact, it has almost nothing to do with it. But it may well be the twilight of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Or it would be, if we were to stop watching such pauper productions. Marvel movies don't need to be comedies to work. In fact, they shouldn't be comedies at all. They can have elements of comedy, but that's entirely different. Many marvel heroes have a sense of humour, despite their troublesome lives; even through their hardships, they are many times portrayed as having a sense of the comic. But they are not jokers or stand up comedians. Sure, Spiderman is very funny, but his life is one of the hardest in the Marvel universe. To portray Thor, the asgardian god of thunder, as a joker or as a comedian makes no sense at all. He is one of the most sober and serious characters in the Marvel universe. He is not human, he doesn't perceive time as we do, he doesn't think about life as we do, so it makes sense that he doesn't have a sense of humour like we humans do. We could say something similar about the Grandmaster and Hella. Specially Hella. I mean, they weren't able to introduce a single moment of seriousness in the whole movie, not even in characters that shouldn't (couldn't) be laughing like mindless puppets and posing ridiculously every time they appear on screen. It would make sense if Loki was portrayed as mischievous, but that's it. And speaking of Loki, and since this is the Ragnarok after all, they completely distorted the fact that he is the father of the three agents of the destruction of the world: Hella, the wolf Fenrir and the world serpent (there's no world serpent in the movie). Marvel movies can be successful and yet sober. Captain America: Winter Soldier is probably one the best movies of the MCU and it's as sober as it gets. Iron Man (the first installment) deals with the threat of terrorism and weapons trade; it has many comic and funny moments, it's true, but it has a very serious tone underlying it. (This Tony Stark works because of Robert Downey Jr., who is amazing, but the Tony Stark from the comics is paralyzed from the waist down - it doesn't get any more serious than that). Avengers Assemble may not be as sober, but it still manages not to become a comedy show. Sure, Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 was a hit, but it was a joke. It had nothing to do with the first one. It wasn't good. In fact, it was kind of a ""prequel"" for Thor:Ragnarok - for these comedy shows. And if someone thinks I'm exaggerating, just think about that moment when Matt Damon is portraying Loki in that ""theater play"". I mean, it's absolutely ridiculous. It looks like a Jimmy Kimmel show!!! I'm sorry, but Taika Waitiki failed. Eric Pearson and Craig Kyle failed tremendously. I really hope that Infinity War isn't a ""sequel"" to this kind of movie. If it is...please stop. Just stop with this kind of writing. Remember that we, in the audience, are not morons, and that not only kids in their early teens go to the movies. Just think about Logan or Deadpool (not a comedy show, although extremely funny). Forget the PG system, forget the money (you'll make it anyway), forget the special fx. And please, forget this Thor and forget any ideas of turning Infinity War into something like this. If not, we'll have Thanos (Thanos!!!!) cracking jokes all the time...",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

So that is the good aspect of this new Thor, which also happens to be the best of the three; the bad is that, unfortunately, even the creative Taika Waititi can't upset the tired Marvel formula of filling too many scenes with mindless action. It's not like action scenes are bad per se, as they are perfectly rendered in other recent MCU films like ""Homecoming"" or ""Civil War"": they just don't fit in this story as they would elsewhere because they ruin the flow of the story.

189,21 November 2017,Horst_In_Translation,6," Some glaring weaknesses, but still pointless fun as a whole
","""Thor: Ragnarok"" is the newest superhero movie from the Marvel universe and it is the third one starring Thor (not counting the Avengers films). It runs for easily over 2 hours and marks the arrival at Hollywood filmmaking for director Taiki Waititi (NZL), who is also a prolific actor himself and voice acts in here too. Apart from Chris Hemsworth, there are several other familiar faces in here like Hopkins, Hiddleston, Ruffalo, Elba and Cumberbatch reprising their roles while new additions like Blanchett, Goldblum, Thompson and Urban add their share too, sometimes for the good, at other times not so much. I'll get to that in detail soon. First of all, it needs to be said that this was certainly a solid watch. It is a film that will entertain you well if you want it to. However, the moment you take an in-depth look at it, you will find flaws, flaws that are frequent and flaws that are crucial. One example would be Tessa Thompson's character and performance which was extremely underwhelming as honestly there was nothing remotely interesting about her in here that justified her being built up as a love interest to Thor. Sure seems like they are really struggling with regard to those. At least Portman gets a mention. Blanchett made a pretty good villain to be honest thanks to costume mostly, but also thanks to the actress being almost too good for the part. Sadly her connection with Urban's character never really gains steam, her character feels like the exact opposite of somebody who would get herself an executioner and so the final twist in this relationship stays really underwhelming. Same can be said about the death of Hopkins' character that had zero emotional impact on me unfortunately.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

","After so many films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the filmmakers always seem to keep them fresh and interesting. Thor: Ragnarok is interesting and fresh to say the least. The director Taika Waititi is a genius behind the camera as he somewhat changed the feel of the Thor films but keeping some of the familiarities associated with the previous films. The comedic level is sky-high, as most of it was giggling fun thanks to Waititi's direction, as a result it seemed like the actors had a lot more fun, but had their work cut out for them. The cameos in this film are splendid especially in one particular scene with cameos by Sam Neill (Jurassic Park), Liam Hemsworth (Chris Hemsworth's brother), and Matt Damon (The Bourne Identity). Cate Blanchett as always does an outstanding job as the villainess Hela. Her commitment to the role was respectable in that she actually studied a Brazilian martial art called capoeira, pretty cool right? Karl Urban also had some homework to do to get ready for his role; he shaved his hair, and worked out. The effort by the actors especially the ones I mentioned make this film that much more pleasurable, the people actually cared about the film and the story, as all films should be. The action was intense, the acting was superb, the effects were stunning, and the story was likable. However, the only problems for me that prevents it from being a 10/10 is the just the length, I actually could have gone for more, it was too short in my opinion. But that's not a fault, just a nitpick, or in another way, its actually a positive since I enjoyed the film so much, so take the rating with a pinch of salt. Overall, I loved this movie!

","Marvel comics was once my favorite brand of comics but these days not so much. They have disbanded all their classic characters Peter Parker, Bruce Banner and even Tony Stark with stupid replacements like Miles Morales, some Asian Hulk and RI RI Williams as Iron Woman, so I'm not a fan of their comics anymore. Marvel Studios has been great I have loved all their films except for Iron Man 2 and then came Spider-Man: Homecoming which is undoubtedly one of the worst things I have seen done to my favorite superhero. Now comes the third Thor film and Thor has been the weakest even though I do love both movies but this, this is cool. Thor has been going around through the nine realms trying to find answers about the Infinity Stones but as we see is captured by Surtur the fire demon. He escapes and returns to Asgard Once there he sees that Loki has taken their fathers place, he demands Loki to take him to father. After they find Odin they are greeted by Hela who destroys Thor's hammer and as the two brothers try to escape through the Bifröst, Hela plunges them both into a different Realm. Now Thor must get the help of old and new ally to help him return home and prevent Hela from destroying Asgard. The opening scene with Surtur is my favorite part of the whole movie. I was just so excited to see him since in Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes cartoon he appeared briefly but he wasn't around for much. If any big gripe I have with the movie it's that I wanted to yet again see more of him and just Thor fighting. But it was great to see him finally. This is the funniest of the Thor movies and when I heard about this I was super concerned because I am not a huge fan of comedy and for a movie with a fire demon to have comedy kind of gave me a bad impression before going in. But the jokes mostly hit with me. Chris Hemsworth is funny. When they announced Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie I was very opposed to the idea, I have expressed in my review of Spider-Man: Homecoming that I hate it when comic book movies change the race of characters. It's even just as bad when they do it in Norse mythology or any myth and legend, that's not how history has shown or described them to be so to change it is just wrong. We can excuse it for Heimdal because Idris Elba is a good actor but I had no idea who this chick was, but she was great in the movie. I'm not a fan that they changed her race, Valkyrie is a white blonde. But Tessa did pretty great so I'll allow it, let's just say that's a nitpick. Cate Blanchett as Hela the Goddess of Death was amazing. Some might say that shes not that great of a villain but I disagree she's called the Goddess of death and Odin's daughter who fought alongside him. She has a clear goal of destroying her father's land because she is the goddess of death. Battleworld, where Thor meets up and battles the Hulk is a great looking environment. The fight with the hulk was great and it was great to see Jeff Goldblum have fun with himself and everyone there. The best thing about this movie is its aesthetic, the movie looks beautiful. Like a 70s or 80s high fantasy movie. That's what mostly appealed to me in this movie it was cool to see in a Thor movie. Director Taika Waititi is also in the movie voicing Korg who is one of the best new characters the MCU has introduced recently. He did a great job directing this film, I wouldn't be surprised if Kevin Feige and the studio decided to keep him around to direct another Marvel project. Thor: Ragnarok is the best of all the Thor films. In a time where I believe the Marvel cinematic universe is beginning to show more cracks, Thor: Ragnarok still gives us one big fun adventurous ride with our favorite asgardians and the big green Hulk, not to mention the best music video of the Immigrant song.

","Taking a page from the popular ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" films, ""Thor: Ragnarok"" is played strictly for laughs. I initially disliked the constant stream of wisecracks and sight-gags, but after a while got into the spirt of the film and for the most part enjoyed it. Once again, the hero has to deal with a malevolent God (in this case, Thor's sister Hela), which after a few diversions to pick up the supporting cast, leads to a climatic CGI-spectacular showdown. Chris Hemsworth seems to have fun playing the flippant (and sometime petulant) God of Thunder, as does Cate Blanchett, who plays his wicked sister, the be-antlered Goddess of Death Hela, and Tom Hiddleston, back for the fourth round as duplicitous brother Loki. The special effects, if not particularly novel or imaginative, are excellently rendered and the supporting cast (humans and otherwise) entertaining. The score includes Led Zeppelin's iconic ""Immigrant Song"", which adds a real kick to the battles. The 'plot' is some vague revision of the ""Ragnarok"" legend (in which Asgard is overcome and the Gods (including Thor) destroyed), and a few players from that story make appearances (e.g. The Fenris Wolf, The Midgard Serpent, Surtr), but it's all just an excuse for a massive, but largely bloodless, battle between Thor and his motley crew of supporters and his sister's army of demonic cannon-fodder.

I had to keep backtracking at least 10 minutes in my mind to catch myself up. ""Oh yeah, that happened."" Jeff Goldblum had a lot to offer as the character ""Grandmaster"". He had some funny lines and made me laugh a few times. Cate Blanchett is chilling as the villain ""Hela."" If you thought Tom Hiddleston could be scary at times, just wait until you see her performance. There were a lot of fun Easter Eggs that foreshadow at things to come and it was overall, a very fun movie. Like I said, my only complaint is the all-over-the-place plot, but considering how boring ""Dark World"" was, I'm just glad we finally got a good Thor sequel, even if at times it still could have been better.

","An American fantasy adventure; A story about a warrior who is imprisoned on the other side of the universe and attempts to get back to stop the destruction of his homeworld and finds help from an unexpected source. In a departure from previous films in the series Hemsworth was required to reduce his stony-faced persona and stilted, prosaic delivery in favour of a more humanised, provincial persona. What worked well for the character as a marked contrast to the other heroes is now conspicuous for adding at the very least dimension. It reduced his power overall in a film about a lofty Norse deity but it is more fun for the masses who had seen the previous films if no one else. Hiddleston and Hemsworth have marvellously prickly exchanges throughout. More broadly, the film attempts the sort of ironic humour that worked well for the Guardians of the Galaxy and Deadpool films, but it doesn't succeed quite as well - except when Jeff Goldblum appears. There are improvements on Dark World in terms of the editing - we see much more of the splendour of the visual effects, especially the mystical planets. The film ramps up the talent stakes and theatrical absurdity with Cate Blanchett, but despite her best, melodramatic efforts we don't get the same kind of tension as we did of a banished heir to the throne returning home that we saw in the original Thor film. The director injects some New Zealand personality which characterises the film but the plot feels papered over with slogans and it feels like a silly pantomime in parts.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

From drunk Valkyries to naked Hulk this movie is filled with jokes a 10 year old boy would find funny. The director fancies himself a funny, funny man indeed. Well then perhaps his calling was to a career in stand up comedy where some of this low brow humor might land on willing ears. I'd rather be tied up and forced to watch the entire season of The Inhumans on infinite loop rather than be subjected to this film even one more time. Howard The Duck had better jokes than this and at least wasn't afraid to push the envelope into R rated territory but what we get with this allegedly family friendly romp through the halls of a junior high school hallway between bells is something which makes Tyler Perry filmmaking look like top tier cinematic entertainment. On the other hand it sure seems a fitting prequel to the forthcoming Love & Thunder which sounds as if it will only amp up the sophomoric gross out jokes from this abomination of a movie!

","I must admit, the first two Thor movies are some of my least favorite movies in the entire MCU. They both feel very silly and not very competent at all to me, and I was pretty worried that this was going to be similar in quality. That fear did not come true in the slightest though, as this movie is a gem that I liked way more than I should. On paper, this doesn't seem like anything special. The plot is really basic at first, the characters are just passable and so is the acting. The villain is pretty boring, and her plan felt very reharshed from previous Marvel movies. I will say though, the climax subverts your expectations really nicely, and I liked that they went in a new direction with the old ""End of the world""-trope. Still, this movie seems really basic on paper, and it probably would be in practice as well, had it not been for one crucial thing: The COMEDY. This is without a doubt the funniest movie in the entire MCU. Every scene has funny moments, every character spits out jokes and one-liners left and right. Some characters feel like they were only created to be comic relief, yet I am not even mad, as they're all comedy geniuses. My personal favorite side-character was Korg, every single word that came out of his mouth was pure gold, and the same can be said for several other characters as well. Loki worked way better as a side-kick than the antagonist, which was something I pointed out about Thor: The Dark World (In practice the only thing that movie got right). And the fact that Jane and Erik wasn't in the movie, yet I didn't miss them for a second, unfortunatly speaks to their worth as characters. This entire movie is comedy gold, there is no other way to describe it. Every scene is great, every joke lands, this is such a delightful movie. It doesn't really have much to offer in terms of multi-layered themes like some other MCU movies, and is therefore not as good, but it's still a awesome movie that greatly exceeded my expectations with how much fun I had watching it. I highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys dumb, hilarious jokes and slap-stick (Which, for the record, I'm not usually a fan of), and to anyone that likes Marvel movies in general. This is by far the best Thor movie and probably one of the funniest movies I've seen in years. It's just that hilarious.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

","Thor : Ragnarok is a difficult movie for me to rate and also write a review about.
I have to say that - overall - I do enjoy watching the movie; I have watched it more than twice.
Overall, though, I would argue that this movie has some major flaws - in my humble opinion - as follow:
> I do not have a problem, in principle with a little bit of humour in an otherwise serious movie. Humour in this movie, however, I will say has gone too far- so much so, that it is attempting to make Thor a comedy.
> The use of different accents for different characters seems to me to be a further attempt yo transform the story into a comedy, and I, personally very much disagree with it. It is plain silly!
> Again this is my personal opinion : but there are some things that you just simply do not play around with : the concept of an English-speaking, highly vocal, beads-around-the-neck-wearing Hulk is simply laughable.
> As a NZer, i can relate to the humor and (regardless of the disdain I have for the Kiwi director) do enjoy watching the movie... but the geek in me insists that some things are sacred :

","The first Thor film was good, Avengers Assemble was brilliant, The Dark World was great, this is the third solo movie for one of the key heroes in the Marvel Universe, and I was very excited to see it. Basically it is two years after the Battle of Sokovia, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has been imprisoned by the fire demon Surtur (Clancy Brown), during his unsuccessful search for the Infinity Stones. Surtur reveals Thor's father Odin (Sir Anthony Hopkins) is no longer on Asgard, and the prophesied Ragnarök will destroy his realm, once Surtur unites his crown with the Eternal Flame that burns in Odin's vault. Thor breaks his chains and defeats Surtur, claiming his crown, believing his has prevented Ragnarök, returning to Asgard he finds that Odin is actually his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is disguise, Thor forces Loki to help him find their father. With the help of Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) on Earth, Thor and Loki find Odin in Norway, he explains that he is dying, he reveals that he has a firstborn child, Hela (Cate Blanchett), who was sealed in a prison long ago, Odin's passing will allow her to escape. Hela is known as the ""goddess of death"", she was leader of Asgard's armies, and had conquered the Nine Realms with Odin, but she imprisoned and written out of history after Odin feared she had become too ambitious. Odin dies, and Hela released from imprisonment appears, she destroys Thor's hammer Mjolnir, Thor and Loki try to flee through the Bifröst Bridge, but she pursues them and forces them out into space. Hela travels to Asgard, destroying its army and the Warriors Three, she resurrects the ancient dead who once fought with her, including the giant wolf Fenris, and appoints Asgardian Skurge (Karl Urban) as her executioner. Hela plans to use the Bifröst to expand Asgard's empire, but all-seeing, all-hearing Asgardian sentry Heimdall (Idris Elba) has stolen the sword that controls the Bridge, he has gathered the rest of Asgard's citizens to hide away. Thor crash-lands on Sakaar, a garbage planet surrounded by wormholes, he is captured by bounty hunter Scrapper 142, aka Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), and taken to the planet's ruler, the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum). There Loki has already become ingratiated, but Thor will serve as a gladiator, Thor recognises 142 as a Valkyrior, a legendary force of female warriors who were killed defending Asgard from Hela long ago. After his hair cut shorter, Thor is forced to compete in the Grandmaster's Contest of Champions, the undefeated champion turns out to be Thor's old friend the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), they fight, with Thor eventually summoning lightning to almost defeat the Hulm, before the Grandmaster sabotages the fight to ensure the Hulk's victory. Still enslaved, Thor attempts to convince Hulk and 142 to help him save Asgard, but neither are willing to help, Thor manages to escape the palace and finds the Quinjet that brought Hulk to Sakaar, Hulk follows him, he is only transformed back into Bruce Banner seeing a recording of Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) for the first time since Sokovia. The Grandmaster orders 142 and Loki to find Thor and Hulk, 142 decides to help, after reliving the deaths of her fellow Valkyrie at the hands of Hela, Loki helps the group to steal one of the Grandmaster's ships they then liberate the other gladiators, including Korg (Taika Waititi, also directing), to stage a rebellion. Loki attempts to betray his brother to gain a reward from the Grandmaster, but Thor anticipated this and leaves him behind, he is soon found by the gladiators, while Thor, Banner and 142 escape through a wormhole to Asgard, where Hela's forces are attacking Heimdall and Asgard's citizens. Banner becomes Hulk again, fighting Fenris, while Thor and 142 battle Skurge and the resurrected warriors, Loki and the gladiators soon arrive to help, the citizens are evacuated boarding the large ship, a repentant Skurge sacrifices himself to allow their escape. Thor and Hela battle, Thor loses his eye during the fight, he has a vision of Odin that helps him realise only Ragnarök can stop Hela, so while Hela is distracted, Loki finds Surtur's crown and places it in the Eternal Flame, Surtur is reborn and destroys Asgard, seemingly killing Hela. Thor and the others escape with the remaining citizens aboard the Grandmaster's vessel, forced to watch the prophesied destruction of their home, Thor is crowned king, he decides to take his people to Earth, the mid- credits sequence sees them pursued by a large spaceship, and the post- credits sequence sees the Grandmaster encountering a group of his former subjects, who are still rebelling.

Whereas previous entries have been a little technological and filled with complicated bits, this takes things back to basics, just creating a simple story of a prophesied apocalypse and the hero needing to save the world, but what makes this entry much more interesting is not just the brilliant special effects and fight sequences, but there is much more comedy as well, very witty dialogue and deliberately silly stuff, overall it is a fresh, highly entertaining and exciting fantasy action adventure film.

","Though I liked Chris hemsworth as Thor, I was not any fan of Thor standalone movies. While Thor 1 was strictly okay, Thor 2 was one of the most weakest films of MCU. But in Thor ragnarok Thor franchise gets completely revamped.
Ragnarok format is same like iron man 3. Like in iron man 3 we saw what tony can do without his suit, in Thor ragnarok we can see what Thor can do without his hammer. Despite all the worst things happening to Thor in this one(loses his father, hammer,eye and Asgard kingdom) there is a lot of humor in this one.
When a serious character does humor, his fan following increases like never before. Same has happened with Chris hemsworth whose fan following as Thor has increased leaps and bounds with ragnarok. Though he deliberately does not be funny, situations make it so. With film by film our love towards Loki increases only. So has happened in ragnarok. The bromance between hemsworth and tom Hiddleston is the highlight. Cate blanchett gives a menacing performance which makes hela one of the best villains in MCU. Tessa Thompson was badass as Valkyrie. And last but not the least, I never liked hulk before but with ragnarok I finally started loving him. Seriously the film becomes most entertaining with the entry of hulk.
The music is foot tapping. Only drawback I felt was some portions are dull when Thor is trapped in sakaar. But with the entry of hulk this becomes a hilarious entertainer. Full credit goes to director taika watiti for ressurecting the thor franchise.

Jeff Goldblum. My personal favourite was the Kiwi pile of rocks played with superb dead-pan humour by the film's director Waititi.

Apparently, even in spite of the destruction and death that Loki inflicted on New York in Avengers (2012), it's time to let bygones be bygones. Worst of all, I think, is that while Thor ought to be in Aasgaard dealing with, well, Ragnarok, he spends most of the time in captivity on another planet with the Hulk, all so that the writers can once again showcase superheros battling each other, as if we didn't get enough of that in Civil War, Avengers I and II, and Batman vs. Superman.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

The reason it is one of the better films is because it is SO FUNNY. This movie could easily be labeled as a comedy because it is filled to the brink with jokes.

","Ugh, I really really hated this movie entirely. I was hoping for the heart of Wonder Woman or Lord of the Rings in Epic Quality, I got none of that. I honestly wanted to leave the theater, and mind you that is quite a feat to get me to not want to watch a film anymore. Last movie to hold this distinction of me wanting to leave the theater was that awful live action Scooby Doo movie. I was not wanting to see a comedy but an epic, Shakespearian Drama with realistic humor in small quantities in it like the first one was. I got none of that as well. The only thing I did like was Cate Blanchett as Hela. What bothered me the most was that people were getting killed and maimed by Hela but golly gee! Let's crack another childish joke!!!! Imagine if Game of Thrones was a juvenile comedy like this movie? Thank the Old Gods and the New that GOT is realistic in it's character portrayals. When all is said and done I am just not going to watch another Marvel movie in the theater again. I should have trusted my instinct and not gone like I did with Thor: The Dark World, but I stayed for my mother and that's all. If DC betrays me with Justice League I'm just swearing off modern comic movies altogether and just relying on all my old DVDs of the great Comic movies like the first 2 Raimi Spider-mans, Nolan's Batman movies and X2 to remind me when Comic Movies actually had heart, not the Chaching of the cash register. I felt like Ragnarok completely insulted my intelligence. I grew up with the Christoppher Reeves Superman, I still love the first two Raimi Spidey movies, and the first two X-Men movies as well as Nolan's Batman movies. All of these franchises had quality, intelligence and heart, not treated as a comedy to appeal to the stoner generation and their simple minds.

Loki was reduced to a looser (even beaten by a simple (alchoholic) valkyrie), not that fearful cunning villain as we know him. Dr. Strange became a GOD, if Thor is a demi-god or what. He eliminated Thor and Loki with a hand wave and he can create material (eg: beer) from nothing. Then the ALL SUPER POWER WEAPON was introduced, yes that tiny electric device. Take one and put it on Hella (and save Asgard), on Thanos (no need of Infinity War 1-2) on any one. I beg Disney not to be that simple in the following movies.

","Amazing! This was the best Thor movie and it isn't even close. This one was superior in so many ways. This one had a great plot, a good story, great acting, amazing directing, a different genre, and a better tone. I personally loved the plot of Thor and Loki looking for Odin, then finding him as he is dying. Then, because Odin's powers were the only thing keeping her locked up, Thor and Loki's older sister Hela appeared and shattered Thor's hammer. Thor and Loki then get stranded on Sakar where they find The Hulk who disappeared after Avengers: Age of Ultron. They then teamed up with a former Valkyrie to try and stop Hela from conquering more than just the nine realms. The story was also great, I loved the emotion during Odin's death, and I loved how they were able to tie in Age of Ultron when the Hulk went missing. I feel the writers did a great job. I thought the acting was the best from all the Thor movies, especially the acting for the villain, I loved how Heimdal was portrayed instead of whatever he was in the first two. I also loved Taika Waititi's directing. The directors of the first two Thor movies stuck to a very strict way of portraying everything, you could tell the Taika took lots of risks, and they all paid off. I also like how Marvel is diversifying their genres, it seems they like doing the action comedies, and I have no problem with that because they have all been good. Lastly, I liked the change in tone from the first two movies. They were both darker and serious whereas this movie was more lighthearted and funny.

","First, in full disclosure, I am a Thor comic fan. That being said, I am not one who feels that movie adaptations have to strictly follow the comic versions of characters or stories. I do believe that the movies should follow the spirit of the character though, and that means more than casting a passable actor with convincing special effects. I know there are a lot of people out there that think this was a great movie because of the added comedy, but I disagree. There was far too much tongue-in-cheek content. There is a way to balance lighthearted relief with some dignity, and they failed to do it in this movie. The scenes that took the plot seriously were more the exception than the rule. Despite his penchant for quick action, Thor is not a fool, and he is certainly not a clown. It's fine for such a character to make mistakes, and even to be humiliated by a miscalculation, but the writers and director have an obligation to make it convincing. So here are the spoilers. Thor's capture. How does an electric net, or a tiny shock device immobilize a being who can channel lighting through his body? How does any such device even survive the devastating amount of power he wields. It wasn't convincing, it wasn't funny, and it wasn't even clever.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

1. Jeff Goldblum: 
Dear Jeff Goldblum - could you STOP. I've watched you acting (and really well) in 'Mister Frost' and (with jaws agape in) the Oscar-worthy but sadly neglected 'Adam Resurrected' - but since Adam Resurrected you haven't done a single original character movie. You are your own stereotype - unfortunately, it's the stereotypical Hollywood bullshit 'Well, I have my money, so I'll put in the least effort.' model. Kindly F*ck Off from our screens till ya can be bothered again. And Please don't get me started on your 'Jurassic Park' or 'Independence Day' - repeats of the your idea of a dithering 'genius'.
2. Direction:
Just who or more precisely, what was this Movie aimed at? Sociopaths?
Yes, We'd all show no emotion when our parents die, when friends we'd fought beside for thousands of years were wiped out. When our entire culture and civilisation were brought to ruin. Of course, this might reflect the entire 'stoic' repertoire of the actors... who knows - it's not like the writers gave them much manoeuvrability. (NOTE: Shoot Writers)
3. Timeline: 
You established that time within the 'Universes Dump' was far out of sync with the 'Normal' universe - a day in the 'dump' could mean hundreds of months or years in the 'Real' universe - so how come he arrives at Asgard just a couple of months into Hellas' reign? Lucky, I Guess.

Well, ya missed a few shots here gents... ya didn't mention the word 'Cock' or 'Pussy' or 'Fart' - sure ya tried but couldn't quite fit them in - plus, ya missed references to the Anus... no, no I stand corrected - ya managed to get that particular US Fetish in.

He's absolutely unrecognizable from the other films. He acts like Star Lord instead and fails to be someone worth rooting for. Even Hela can't seem to muster any emotion. She was just freed after thousands of years of captivity and she's not even angry. She just smirks the whole movie. No one expresses an iota of feeling in this movie. It's like a Bugs Bunny cartoon. It's fun but there's no weight behind it. Humor is good in a movie but to make a good film you need to balance those elements. This film had humor and action and nothing else.

","As a fan of the previous Thor movies and MCU movies in general, I feel this was the worst Marvel movie so far. I had such high hopes for it, but the genre change to slapstick comedy alienates former fans in favor of bringing in new fans. The only truly funny parts were the ones that weren't trying. Many of the jokes were either crude or aimed at an immature audience, causing them to fall flat (if you have to resort to anatomical jokes, you aren't funny). Hulk was horribly annoying, and many of the characters came off as undignified and wimpy (such as having responses that aren't proportionate to the situation). I felt that the characters that I used to love are suddenly unlikable, and frankly I lost respect for them. I admit that I require my comedy to be intelligent, and this was anything but. I love Cate Blanchett, and her performance was great. In fact, she gave such potential for a cool villain, but Hela wasn't developed enough as a threat, and with the constant bombardment of bad jokes, you don't get a chance to appreciate the situation that she places the heroes in. For a dark situation based loosely on a dark comic and a dark mythology, the serious ""relief"" moments felt out of place. The character arks were obvious, and the solution at the end was dissatisfying and simple. I'm left with the sense that I would give anything for a redo. I'm longing for a third chapter that I can fall in love with. I want to pretend that this movie didn't exist. Bonus stars for good effects.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

","After having a vision during the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Chris Hemsworth returns once again as Thor to investigate his vision on what might be to come. Before he does that, he discovers that Loki has faked his death and has infiltrated Asgard as Thor's father Odin. When he confronts Loki and they return to Earth to find their father, it is discovered that they have a sister named Hela that is Odin's first born. When she destroys Thor's hammer and he's cast out through the nine realms in a place called Shakar, Thor must team up with a new character named Valkyrie, the return of the Hulk, and Loki to return to Asgard to fight Hela while also saving the people of Asgard. So first off, this is definitely my favorite out of all the Thor movies and I think this version of Thor is the best version of the character we have ever gotten. Chris Hemsworth brings his A game as Thor for this film as well as Mark Ruffalo's Hulk. Cate Blanchett as the villain Hela is probably one of my favorite villains to ever come to the MCU as well as being one of the strongest villains we've ever gotten. Tom Hiddleston's Loki is on point and has some of the best lines of the film. Anthony Hopkins has never been more wiser as Odin. Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie is one of my favorite characters to ever come to the Thor franchise.

What makes it worse is that every attempt at comedy fails completely, and either kills the tension (not that there is much in the first place) or distracts from the plot.

","Thor: Ragnarok is jam-packed with comedy. From the opening scene to the final post-credit sequence this film wanted to make us laugh. From that reason it felt more like 'Guardians of the Galaxy' than even the previous 'Thor' movies. It's bright, colourful, and a lot of fun. We were introduced to some fantastic new characters. Among them are The Grandmaster, who is funny, crazy in a way that's charismatic. Valkyrie is good too. Her character has a dark past, but she's strong, Tessa Thompson did a good job. Hela is a pure pantomime villain. The cinematography in this movie was incredible. With help from all the visual effects, the film looks fantastic. In particular there were two or three battle scenes where the film moved in slow motion and what we saw on screen looked like a classic heaven and hell themed oil painting you might find in an art gallery. Those were truly stunning to look at. The choice of music was also good - in particular the Immigrant song. Now I can't listen to the song without having picturing the scene where Thor fights Hela's minions. But to be honest, Thor 3 with the humor felt like a kid's movie at times. One scene which involved Thor throwing something and it bouncing back hitting him on the head was funny, but it's cheap humour.

But the way that Waititi transforms him, and to what extent, really took me out of the movie. Thor is a bumbling moron in this film. He is not in the least bit competent. He's always cracking jokes, or tripping over something. It's slapstick comedy for a character who had previously been established as being a rather serious person with bits of comedy. But this was all comedy, to the point where it felt like an SNL parody sketch rather than a genuine movie. I did not believe for a second that Thor was capable of doing anything, because they made him out to be such an idiot.

","Chris Hemsworth looks like he had a blast making ""Eagle Vs Shark"" director Taika Waititi's colorful, tongue-in-cheek, superhero saga ""Thor: Ragnarok,"" the third—and best--entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe about the Asgardian God of Thunder. ""Thor: Ragnarok"" shares more in common with director Kenneth Branagh's origins epic ""Thor"" (2011) rather than with Alan Taylor's sequel ""Thor: The Dark World."" Unlike the first and third movies,"" ""Thor: The Dark World"" (2013) maintained a serious and straightforward tone. Basically, the second ""Thor"" spurned comedy, slaughtered Thor's mom Frigga, and reformed Thor who had behaved like a blowhard. Comparatively, Waititi and his three scenarists, Eric Pearson of ""Marvel One-Shot: Agent Carter,"" Craig Kyle of ""Planet Hulk,"" and Christopher L. Yost of ""Max Steel,"" not only ridicule Thor, but they also challenge the Son of Odin as he has never been tested. Typically, superhero sagas qualify as predictable since you know the hero will vanquish all adversaries and restore order to the cosmos before the end credits. Although the original ""Thor"" was seldom surprising, our hero suffered the consequences of his hopeless arrogance. Odin deprived his son of his supernatural hammer Mjölnir and banished him to Earth without powers. Good movies run their heroes through a gauntlet, and ""Thor: Ragnarok"" pits the God of Thunder against a virtually invincible adversary--his heretofore unknown, elder sister Hela. While she is more than enough to keep him occupied, Waititi and his writers have added the Incredible Hulk. These adversaries keep Thor behind the eight-ball for three-quarters of its swiftly-paced 130 minutes. Thor tangles with enemies for the first time who can withstand the worst he can dish out. Hela ranks as one of his more memorable foes, and two-time Oscar winning Best Actress Cate Blanchett has a field day as Hela. Decked out in a black, dominatrix outfit, this Goth-looking gal resembles Angelina Jolie's ""Maleficent,"" and the antlers that spring from her head before combat make her appear genuinely sinister.

580,5 November 2017,arnoldmrs,1," The second worst MCU movie until now
","So badly, Ragnarok is not only a threat to Asgard, but also to the entire Marvel Cinematographic Universe (MCU). If the next Avengers (Infinity War) movie follows the same line we may have the end of these franchise much sooner than we expected... Of the nearly 20 MCU films so far, only the Hulk solo movie has managed to be worse than this one. There is no exciting moment in the movie, the soundtrack is very weak, the performances are weak, the characters are two-dimensional, the script is weak and the list goes on. Some of the main characters in the two other Thor films simply disappeared as if they had never existed and others had irrelevant roles. The only characters from the other two movies with relevant roles in this one are Thor himself and Loki, but with totally altered personalities. The two were transformed into clowns. Clearly it's just a comedy movie with action scenes, but it's not even funny to watch. The background story is tragic and does not match with the slapstick comedy they tried to do. Okay, they tried to copy Guardians of the Galaxy (GG), but it did NOT work. GG is genuinely funny and has its exciting/sentimental moments. In Ragnarok there are bland jokes even in the most dramatic moments. Nothing against comedy. The original Avengers movie itself had very funny scenes, but at the same time it reconciled it with moments of seriousness and emotion. Ragnarok looks more like a parody of Thor than a Marvel movie. The film script looks more like a Swiss cheese, with so many holes. Now I will describe some of these plot holes, which can be considered a SPOILER, but I do not advise anyone to waste time watching this movie anyway... I also advise nobody to bring children to watch this movie, because there are death scenes that are treated as comedy and in one of the very few serious scenes in the movie in which a character dies impaled, I heard a six years old boy laughing. Thor's two previous films were not brilliant, but they were competent in portraying the characters and their fictional universe and extremely better as a movie than this fiasco. Now the 21 worst holes in the movie: 1 - Lady Sif, one of the main characters of the other two films is not even mentioned. 2 - Why does Thor, along with Hulk and several other allies give up Hela without practically trying? Thor's extreme and desperate attitude is totally improbable ... Having Hulk an impenetrable skin, it is hard to believe that Hela's strange power to materialize blades would be able to defeat him. 3 - Asgard, a whole planet, seems to have little more than 500 inhabitants and all living in the same city! 4 - Thor does not care or comment on the death of his three best friends. 5 - Thor doesn't care about the destruction of his entire planet. Even other inhabitants living outside that city and the nature. As if he had lived hundreds of years in one place and had no regard for anything. 6. How do everyone on earth know of the details of the relationship between Thor and Jane? Has Thor a Facebook account of public figure?!? 7 - Relationally with Jane is discarded with just one comic phrase, making the previous films ridiculous and meaningless. 8 - Why did you spend money hiring Matt Damon and Sam Neil for ridiculous roles? Was it supposed to be funny? 9 - Why did Valkyrie keep - for THOUSANDS of years - a grievance of Asgard? 10 - Why does Valkyrie suddenly, after these THOUSANDS of years - change her mind and help Thor by risking his own life? 12 - Why is Valkyrie's alcoholism treated as a joke and the same theme banned in another MCU movie? 13 - How Valkyrie, being thousand years older than Thor, does not appear to be older than him? 14 - How does Banner die and rise again? In the original Avengers movie, it is explained that the transformation in Hulk takes place to avoid the Banner's death, which was great, but not that he is able to resurrect Banner after dead. The scene was made like this just to be funny, but it was non sense like almost everything in the movie. 15 - How is Thor slain by Hulk and does not show a scratch? 16 - Loki takes power in Asgard just to make some jokes and eat fruit, wasting a comedy scene on a plot that had been crafted for years by at least three movies (Thor 1 and 2 and The Avengers). 17 - On the planet Hulk, in the arena fight, Thor gets all electrified, but that does not overload the shock disk circuit on his neck. 18 - Incidentally for someone who gets all electrified, having a shock disk as the main weakness is just another plot hole ... ""Like Odin, did you know that Thor and Loki were coming?"" 19 - How does Hela appear from nothing after Odin's death? 20 - How was Hela so powerful early in the movie being so far from Asgard - her source of power? 21- In a scene that a man is melted and the only reaction of Thor is of disgust in a comic scene, which does not match at all with the character and ends up aggravating the trivialization of death that is the tonic of the attempt of comedy in the entire movie.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

","When I first saw the trailer for this movie months back I had a bad feeling about it. In other words, something was telling me it was going to be a huge disappointment. That gut feeling was not wrong. 'Thor: Ragnarok' is a poor attempt of superhero comedy, so poor infact that (like Spiderman: Homecoming) I couldn't bear to watch it all. I'm not sure why the writers decided to take it in the ""humorous"" (I use that term very loosely) direction that they did as all they achieved was to turn Thor into a parody of himself, totally ruining the character in the process. I just didn't get the need for all of the cheesy one-liners that peppered the film like cringe-worthy moments from a stand-up act gone wrong, it truly was unbearable after a while. As other people have said, the films events were supposed to have serious undercurrents but they were all delivered so carefree and joked about that there was very little for us as an audience to emotionally invest in, how can that be a good thing? I didn't care what happened to Thor, Asgard or anything, in fact I wanted everyone to die half hour into the film so I could do something more interesting like paint the fence. I have really been enjoying the MCU films for all these years up until the past two mentioned movies, they have just been plain awful and I really fear that Infinity War is going to go the same route. I hope to god it doesn't as, for me, it will just be a massive shame and a waste of such a good build up of 10 years' worth of excellent movies and story lines.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

","Having really enjoyed the Marvel Universe, I began to feel a little disappointed by Guardians 2, the third iteration of Thor has really dented the illusion. This time round the script is weak, with far too heavy an emphasis bent toward humour, but achingly lazy childish humour, that is repeated far too often. Hemsworth's physique too seems to fluctuate betweeen being heavily bulked up to being significantly not, (obviously not filmed in sequence) Equally there was no character development,with the few new characters having been poorly imagined to the extent that there was no story to carry them. It seems as though they have thinned the cream too much. No intrigue, no tension, no compelling narrative. Perhaps this is the being of the end, perhaps Hemsworth told them he wanted out and is contracted to this and Infinity War. So will we see the demise of Thor in Infinity War.

The lack of distinction between the magic and science mentioned in the first Thor movies finally lives up to the magic side of things; the opening and closing title logos almost as good as the film itself, not to mention the comic-con announcement/trailer typeface, all promising a coin-op arcade cabinet of a film that was eventually, actually, delivered.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

And I think that it's somehow better that the other two movies. However, the trailer looked like this movie will be epic. It was far from that. The plot was underdeveloped and it just doesn't justify the need for this movie, at least for me. It's like they run out of ideas, the story is just so weak...there's really nothing special to it. And you just can't take it seriously because there are too many jokes.Some of them are funny, but some aren't at all or are out of context. For example, at one point, there's this rock golem creature, that it's not from earth,that makes a joke for rock, paper, scissors. How the hell would he know that? You never fear that something bad might happen to a main character, you know for sure that it will end well for them. Also, Loki was a real threat in the previous movies. Now, it just seemed too friendly with everyone. It's like he was a totally different person. And that brings me to one of the worst aspects of this movie...Hera. It is another Marvel villain that could have been incredible. Instead, it has so much power but for nothing...She is just boring because you sense no threat coming from her. So yes, the trailer was way too good for this movie. I had high expectations but I was so disappointed.

There are massive monsters and attractive women; zombie armies and a large unearthly dog; an evil witch and Jeff Goldblum, but this isn't just an additional film to add to the already amazing set of Thor films. Ragnarok is the child of confident filmmaking and understanding of what the Thor franchise has always been. It takes a character that could have always been more as people and audiences have said about Thor, sure he is a god who can destroy basically anything and everything with his Mjölnir (his hammer)but viewers have said that there is more to Thor than is being shown on screen and that's what is shown in Ragnarok. Marvel have kept to their promise through competent storytelling and unbridled enthusiasm for the world that it will. This is exactly the type of reward that audiences expected to receive from this film. The vibrancy of the scenes and the DVD cover it attracts and compels the audience to look further into the scene and draws the audience eye every which way and keeps the audience drawn in at every moment, thus never losing their attention for a moment.

731,27 February 2018,TheMovieDiorama,5," Thor: Ragnarok is the third entry in the God of Thunder's series, and is a fresh reinvention of the character.
","Hollywood, listen to me. Give Taika Waititi massive budgets because it's clear he makes films fun. Marvel continues their trend of making light hearted comic book adaptations, but at a cost that too many people are overlooking. In this chapter, Thor returns to Asgard but the city is threatened by an old legendary villain: Hela, the Goddess of Death. Thrown out of the Bifrost, he must team up with old and new allies to prevent Ragnarok from occurring. It's another overstuffed chapter filled with Easter Eggs, returning characters and much promise for future entries (specifically Infinity War). The surprising alteration was Marvel's fresh reinvention of Thor and the remaining characters. The extremely witty and humorous script assists in bringing the characters to life, more so than before. The banter is hilarious, extremely energetic performances and far more self aware than any other MCU entry. Despite all of this, I feel it's far too late to reinvent these characters. Thor is suddenly a comedic genius and knows far too much about Earth (including it's colourful English language...). Heimdall doesn't feel like his past iteration at all. Completely different. Personally, I like consistency. In a bid to make a visual delight full of bright contrasting colours like Guardians of the Galaxy, it unfortunately feels like Marvel had abandoned the previous Thor films and the darker and richer style they had. We all know these blockbusters have good performances. The action set pieces are entertaining as always. Waititi's direction is a welcome addition. I just feel, dare I say, underwhelmed by superhero films these days. The human CGI was a let down, Hela was underdeveloped and it all wrapped up too quickly with no impact! It sounds like I'm being harsh for the sake of it, I'm not. I honestly enjoyed this and it felt like a comic book movie.

Anyway, Ragnarok seemed to drag out a short story to a little over two hours painfully trying to convince me how dire the situation was with Hela and the imminent destruction of Asgard. Dr. Strange's appearance was .. strange. Short. A waste of using him in a near non-sequitur. Cate Blanchett rocks the Hela character. She made Death gorgeous, catty, bitter and looking fabulous. I was hoping for something more wicked, darker, after all she is the Goddess of Death. The character got lost though in lots of chatter and stand and pose. Several instances pop up that pose questions, like how did Hulk manage to talk so much, and how did he, in all his green anger, seem to be sexy? Why?

Jeff Goldblum plays himself on the planet he originally came from and it's hilarious. His no. 1 stooge is played by the same Kiwi actress who played the child welfare lady in Watiti's own Hunt for the Wilderpeople and she's even funnier here. Hemsworth and Hiddleston have their comic-duo routine down by now after rehearsal in Thor the Dark World. Mark Ruffalo exaggerates his own neurotic-ness so much you can only laugh at how ridiculous he is. There are actually several very funny verbal exchanges that left me impressed at the writers. Maybe Watiti should write more scripts. The designs are so refreshingly retro; I wish more modern movies looked as clunky as this.

This movie gives a really good version of the Hulk who is very fun. This movie is overall just fun and that's all it really needed. The villain in this film is Hela who is a fun villain but like most of the Marvel villains, she is quite lackluster and dull. The scenes where Thor is on Sakaar are the best scenes in the movie, but the scenes on Asgard are quite dull and you don't want to stay there for long. The comedy is excellent and it's on of the funniest Marvel movies ever.

","One of my favorites, for all ages. This film really expands Thor. The character development is great, making him more relatable due to time on Earth. The lightheartedness of the movie and the film overall was a bold and unique move. Taika Waititi really brought this movie together and redeemed Thor. Ragnorak was vital for Thor's unleashing of his full potential. Allowing the actors to improvise and bring out themselves through the characters made all the difference as well.
The storyline blends in nicely and it explains so much, and catches everyone up. It doesn't feel like an unnecessary add on. We had Loki on the Throne from The Dark World, which was a problem that needed to be addressed. We have a missing Thor and Hulk in Civil War, which needed to be explained, and of course Thanos had to start somewhere. The whole movie fits in so nicely to the MCU
Another thing I just have to point out is the CGI and visuals of this movie are spot on, down to the smallest detail. Even Hulk looked so much like Mark Ruffalo.
The only complaint I have is that sometimes the humor was a little to much at parts. We didn't really need to see Thor scream like a little girl.

817,8 June 2018,JeffOA,6," A mishmash of ideas
","Ragnarok while being a fun movie felt extremely dull regarding overall tone and execution. Two stories mashed into one movie.
It has fun moments like the arena planet scenes, but the Ragnarok part of the plot is rather tone deaf. Odin's 'scene' is rushed and void of emotional impact. Acting is weird at times, especially Loki's lines were delivered weirdly at a few places and the writing/humour falls flat often throughout.
Moreover the directing is rather mixed too, resulting in failed moments and causing some of the problems mentioned before. Because of this action scenes often shot in a way that eliminates tension and impact. The army massacre scene was particularly unbelievably weak. The CGI is rather inconsistent too. Some of the scenes were really unimpressive, felt half-complete while others looked cool.
I would also add that the visual and musical style also felt weird, the film having a kind of 80s vibe, with almost game-like sequences with pumping 'rock' music then of course the usual mythological-superhero crossover music came in at a few places. This further adds to the confusion whether this supposed to be an action oriented, fun movie or a more cataclysmic story of destruction and loss. In the end the dual story line might have been the biggest issue in the movie. These are two very different sides of the same universe and does not add up to a coherent experience.
My favourite scenes from the movie that I really liked are definitely from the arena. Though there are problems there aplenty too like Hulk being advertised as a killing machine then after the fight showing him as a sobered down version of himself joking around and being adorable. This is weird as hell. I would even call this lazy writing which is nothing new in this genre.
Another thing which is not really an issue for me but which can be a kind of lore-breaking decision is to cast a mixed race woman as a valkyrie. Though once again I am not sure how accurate this based on the comic books but mythologically it seems to be rather conflicting. Nevertheless it was not a huge thing overall, and on the other hand I am quite happy with Heimdall's portrayal to be honest.
Overall based on my first watch Ragnarok felt a rather rushed movie with mixed execution. The Thor series is the weakest of the standalone ones (on the level of the Hulk movies maybe), Ragnarok being the latest and possibly the best so far. I am sure that the character and related universe can be used to come up with a great story but so far the Thor franchise was let down by filmmakers. This film was a great chance to prove the worthiness and relevance of it but they wanted a little bit too much and tried too hard to be bigger and more filled than the previous resulting in a chaotic mess.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

Apart from that there only a couple of isolated titters. The movie on the whole appears to be aimed at a Grade School intellect, starting from the ridiculous lead in intro with Hemsworth, Ruffalo, Waititi, and a movie fan prior to the movie commencing. The movie relied far too much on CGI which wasn't up to standard and over the top at times. Hemsworth's performance is generic and bland while Ruffalo puts in his usual average effort. Blanchett was the Star of the show while the rest of the cast were OK but don't blink or you will miss Idris Elba's performance.

865,5 November 2017,Screen_Blitz,9," Arguably the most daunting entry of the franchise, Thor: Ragnarok takes its titular hero to subversive heights, sending its trilogy to a stunning conclusion
","Where were Thor and Hulk during the drama of 'Captain America: Civil War'? This question is answered in this third and final chapter of the Thor trilogy. Going out with a bang, Thor: Ragnorak shows director Taika Watiti, the man behind the fairly underseen 'Hunt for The Wilder People', embracing the glamorous spirit of the eponymous Marvel Comics hero and exercising it with flying colors, while constructing the veins to the events of the upcoming 'Avengers: Infinity War'. And for the tasty extra, Hulk is in on this one, making for yet another opportunity to take the Avengers and cross them over with their film's shared universe. Following its predecessor 'Dark World', this second sequel improves upon its predecessor in many ways while adding something fresh to build upon an exciting special-effects-heavy thrill ride without dedicating too much time on establishing connections with the MCU. The concluding result is a whiplash of a superhero spectacle that competes with both 'Logan' and last summer's 'Wonder Woman' for the crown of superhero film of the year. Chris Hemsworth strikes back in his role as Thor who, along with his mischievous brother Loki (played by Tom Hiddleston), is warned by their father Odin (played by Anthony Hopkins) of the escape of their estranged older sister Hela (played by Cate Blanchett), the God of Death who is set to wreck havoc on the realm of Asgard. Crashing on a mysterious planet run by an eccentric grandmaster (played by Jeff Goldblum), they cross paths with Asgard warrior Valkyrie (played by Tessa Thompson) and Thor's former ally Hulk (played by Mark Ruffalo) who is he forced to fight against in a gladiator battle. Together, they must build their alliance to make their way back to Asgard to bring down the evil Hela before it's too late. ",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017
866,30 November 2019,supermaggie,3," Not a Thor-movie anymore
","My goodness, where do I start? Perhaps with the most tragic thing: this is not a Thor movie. Period. Starting with the obvious: The producers take away Thor's trademark: the great blond mane - we all know what this did with Samson, and for this series it is almost the kiss of death. But unfortunately it was to be expected, because while Hollywood has been continuously discriminating against blonde actresses (and has made Cinderella African-American, Dorothy of Oz a Latina, etcetc.), it recently occupied almost more blond male actors than ever before, but it was only a matter of time that this comes to an end; instead of actually treating everybody equal (with equal advantages and disadvantages for all), whites are successively eliminated and disenfranchised - and this is not propaganda, just the observation of a propaganda taking place - and since they cannot replace the actor for the Nordic God ( naturally and authentically a blond actor) after several films and make him African-American / ... all of a sudden, they can at least cut his hair so short that it looks almost dark. (The fact that at least one blonde actress was cast with Cate Blanchett is good in itself, but more likely due to the New Zealand director than the discretion of Hollywood, and besides, she is allowed to participate only dyed black and portraying the ultimate evil; and in addition: the Valkyrie is hispanic - for real? That's an affront to all the Nordic nations, and if you did that with legends of nations of a different color, there would be rebellions, but you're obviously allowed to do that to white people, because nobody cares, and if they protest and try to defend themselves, they'll wrongfully and inappropriately be called Nazis). And then there is the problem that even with a crop it still remains a handsome blond actor, so he must be mutilated and lose an eye, I guess this is than okay/enough for the time being for today's political Hollywood. The fact that the quality and attraction of the films and the storytelling and the authenticity thereby completely perish does not matter anymore anyway. Only money and political propaganda still count. But that alone does not completely destroy Thor 3 yet. Three Australian and New Zealand actors in the main cast and a New Zealand director - and it turns into a surreal-poor Mad Max - Thunderdome-ish musical, only (fortunately) without singing (and I do like Karl Urban and Cate Blanchett a lot and Chris Hemsworth with hair, but not Mad Max or a Mad Max-Thor Version, respectively). The whole series thus degenerates into a farce and great actors like Jeff Goldblum are degraded to a fool. You can actually spare another Thor movie. Dead and please do not revive, unless again as in the beginning, when the story (and legend) was still worth something.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

","To say 'Thor: Ragnarok (2017)' is best of the three solo 'Thor' films, which it almost certainly is despite its tonal differences, may be faint praise but it's praise nevertheless. This generally entertaining, if somewhat messy piece, gets better once its plot is properly underway, which sadly takes around half of its runtime. At this point, the new comedic approach meshes with the pseudo sci-fi aesthetics to create a truly distinct entry in the 'MCU'. Though this unique approach isn't entirely successfully and is occasionally feels a little at odds with the core characters, it ultimately makes the piece a lot more fun than it likely otherwise would have been. It doesn't quite manage to hit all of its emotional beats, but it does manage to keep you entertained (again, much more in its second half) and is actually a lot more plot-focused than you may expect. It typically does a good job with its characters, although the villainess is a little weak, and is often genuinely enjoyable. It's funny at times, too. The first half is a bit of a slog, though, and the end result isn't as compelling or affecting as you'd hope. Still, it will probably satisfy disillusioned Thor fans, so long as they don't mind changing his DNA a little; it's certainly better than either of his previous two outings. 6/10.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

Still, the movie isn't perfect. The musical accompaniment towards the end of the film was disturbing. The music was very upbeat and uplifting and didn't really fit in with what was going on. Why is the effect of immersion turned out to be incomplete. Loki is far from being as good (but still happy). Thor finally looks like a real Asgardian - brutal, powerful and impatient (all he needed was a haircut).

","Thor: Ragnarok is a Guardians of the Galaxy rip-off. Plain and simple. It was a sci-fi comedy full of Guardians of the Galaxy's similarity both visually and in its humor. The film was packed with joke and the actions in the movies are weak. The movie is about something as dark and serious as Ragnarok yet the movie fails to show any seriousness to it and shows how little the subject is for the character to not have any sense of urgency towards it at all. Speaking of character, Thor was not Thor for the majority of the film. His personality has been push toward that of Tony Stark, where he makes jokes at nearly every single moment in the film. Regardless, Thor has some moments in the film that were funny along side that of Mark Ruffalo's Hulk and Tom Hiddleston's Loki. However, the hype the movie built surrounding that of the Valkyrie was just that, nothing but hype. During Thor's first meeting with the Valkyrie, Tessa Thompson was hyped to be a major or focal point in the film but during the climax unfortunately did nothing but show up here and there.

This is the third Thor solo movie-not counting the Avengers & Doctor Strange movies-and I think it's the best one of them all. In Norse mythology, Ragnarok means 'Twilight of the Gods', or basically, the end of everything. It really has some surprising instances where I found myself saying, 'They didn't really just do that, did they?' I won't spoil them all here but people die-and I'm talking main characters-and things are destroyed. Chris/Thor is neck deep in trouble when his older sister, Cate/Hela, shows up wanting to take over Asgard. FYI: Cate is the first female villain in the Marvel movie universe. Tom/Loki is thrown into the mix and you wonder just whose side he is on-remember, he is the god of lies. While fighting Cate, Chris gets sent to a planet run by Jeff/Grandmaster. Jeff has gladiatorial games as his source of entertainment and his current champion is Mark/Hulk. Guess who he gets to fight next? Stan Lee makes his usual cameo-look for the guy giving Chris a haircut-and there are a couple of other cameos, both of the super hero and actor variety. Let me tell you, Jimmy Kimmel would positively hate one of them. There is a lot more humor here, too. There is no Jane Foster & company. I want to mention a pet peeve of mine; Lots of times a song will be used in the trailer but not appear in the movie. I'm talking about Led Zeppelin's 'Immigrant Song' here. That is not the case. It was used several times during Chris's fights. There are two scenes after the credits start. One just as they start and one at the very end. It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci-fi violence & action and some brief nudity- don't get too excited, it's of the Hulk's backside-and has a running time of 2 hours & 10 minutes.

","Review:
What a great movie! I laughed from the beginning to the end, and the action was top form. I did find the humour slightly strange compared to the previous movies, especially the colourful cinematography used in Sakaar but it was very well written and the new characters, were all a great addition to the Thor franchise. Anyway, the movie kicks off with Thor (Chris Hemsworth) imprisoned on the other side of the universe by the fire demon, Surtur in Muspelheim. When Surtur reveals that Thor's father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), is no longer at Asgard, and that it will soon be destroyed in the prophesied Ragnorak, Thor defeats Surtur, believing that he has prevented Ragnorak. Thor then returns to Asgard, to find his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) in charge, so he gets him to tell him were there father is. With the help of Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), they meet up with there father, who tells them that his passing will allow there sister Hela (Cate Blanchett), to escape from prison, were she was sealed a long time ago. Odin imprisoned Hela after she became too ambitious while she was the leader of Asgard's armies, forcing Thor to take the realm once Odin became too old to battle. Now with his son's beside him, Odin sadly dies and Hela appears, bringing pure evil with her. During a battle with her brothers, she destroys Thor's hammer, and sends them into outer space to die. Now in Sakaar, a slave trader, Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) saves Thor from evil doers, and takes him to the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum) who forces Thor to fight for survival in the Contest of Champions. The first contestant that Thor has to fight, turns out to be the mighty Hulk, who is very famous in the land of Sakaar for beating all of the opponents that he comes face to face with. After a tight match, Thor finally manages to convince the Hulk that he is truly Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), and with the help of Valkyrie and his brother Loki, they fight to get back to Asgard to save the people from the evil Hela. There are many other elements of the storyline that made this movie great, which is why I'm really looking forward to seeing another movie in this franchise. The thing that surprised me the most, was the fact that Thor was just as powerful without his hammer. I also enjoyed watching another side to Hulk, who really made me chuckle when he was in his luxury pad with Thor. Anyway, this is definitely one of my favourite films of last year, close to Wonderwoman, so it is truly a ""Must See"" from me. Great Film!",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

932,3 January 2018,fabienbarabeart,2," One hot mess
","Thor Ragnarok was the worst of the three films so far. Why? The dialogue for instance, it took three writers for this? The movie goes in too many directions and at one point I was wondering, what are they trying to do? Is this supposed to be a science fiction, comedy or super-hero film? If I wanted to see a comedy then that's what I would have gone to see. I did not find what was supposed to be comedic moments funny at all, in fact, I cringed. It seems too many cooks spoiled the broth. 
Marvel had been doing so well and they had a good thing going with the first two films. This would have been better if they had kept with the Hela story line from the beginning and delve into the Odin myth a little more deeply. I can't fault the film for the special effects as there were some pretty impressive visuals. But it takes more than special effects to make a good film. Even the acting was lacking and that Chris Hemsworth simply did for the $$$$.
If Thor truly needed help in defeating Hela, it might have been better had he stayed with Dr. Strange rather then end up at the far end of the universe to find Hulk as his ally. He should have had help from the Guardians of the Galaxy while they were at it.
I suppose, I let myself get caught up in the hype with the initial reviews and how great it was doing at the box office as well as here on IMDb. I kept saying, I can't wait to see this movie and now I wish I had waited as this is two hours I can never get back. I'm only giving it 2/10 and that is being generous.

He fights to stop Ragnarok from occurring and defeat the villainous Hela, played by Cate Blanchett. This film is not the best Marvel Universe film I have seen, but it is still great and tremendously hilarious. With exception to most of the action scenes, every corner has a touch of comedy riddled in the storyline. Most of the special effects in the film are spot on, but when they aren't, it is very noticeable. The main storyline is of this film is unmistakable, but the little snippets for the supporting cast help to build the overall back story. Director Taika Waititi did an amazing job fitting those sequences in the film and allowing the comedy to breath where ever possible.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

The new Thor is a comedy, action comedy, and one of the best Marvel films, side by side with Deadpool, Doctor Strange and Guardians, maybe even slightly better. Story itself breaks out of a superhero pattern, the characters are comical, and even those we've seen in the previous films got a relaxed and comical note, and the one-liners are hilarious. Comedy here is not just spice, like in the previous films, but from the beginning it strikes right into the head and does not stop to the end of the film, varying from light humor, through ""WTF?!"" and ""I can't believe what he just said/done,"" to the complete shame-transfer.

","Personally, I felt the other Thor movies were too dark and too boring. I was somewhat hesitant to see this, but the commercials lured me in. This one reminded me more of the Guardians of the Guardians of the Galaxy movies. It was funny and very colorful. Chris Hemsworth is a funny guy- he has shown this in other projects. Here they decided to make use of it while having lots of action. This movie was Avengers meets Guardians. There is a team of ""Avenger"" type characters here also.

1016,27 April 2018,WooderIce64,8," Different, but in a Good Way
","The first two Thor movies are among the MCU's least popular. While they're still good movies, they don't compare to most of the MCU. Ragnarok, on the other hand, is among Marvel's best thus far. The word Ragnarok, meaning the end of all, refers to the destruction of Asgard and the death of the gods in Norse mythology. Pretty heavy stuff. Ironically, this is one of Marvel's most comedic movies. It's simultaneously one of the darkest in the franchise, and also possibly the funniest. It's a very difficult thing to pull off, but it's done here quite well. The movie also spends most of the time alternating between Sakaar and Asgard, which helps this effect. On Asgard, which has been invaded by Hela while Thor and Loki are on Sakaar, things are very dark and serious, and the film racks up quite the body count. Sakaar, on the other hand, is ruled by an over-the-top Jeff Goldblum who stages gladiator fights and has an array of over-the-top quirks. The contrast is clear. Another one of the movie's strengths was how awesome Hela is. Her backstory, where she conquered the 9 Realms with Odin until Odin sought to build a peaceful Asgard, was an interesting twist. Speaking of Odin, what's not awesome was how easily he died. While I'm not trying to compare this to Norse Mythology, there he was killed by Fenrir, the really big dog. Here, he just dies from some unexplained cause, looking out into the sea, with Thor and Loki by his side. It's peaceful, yes, but not nearly as awesome as what could have been. The Warriors Three, some of the most important characters in the first two, die early on and are never mentioned again. Sif isn't even in it at all. However, the characters that are given more attention are much better. Thor is not as serious as the other Avengers, but he is still clearly determined to save Asgard. Valkyrie is a fan favorite, and she has a good character arc of returning to Asgard after abandoning it years ago. By the way, am I the only one who thinks it's stupid that Thor, God of Thunder, is stopped by a little electric thing? Anyway, Loki continues his infamous side-switching, causing the viewer to question where exactly his loyalty lies throughout the film. The Hulk is in this movie, and the stakes with him seem much higher than they have in his previous appearances. Korg is Marvel's best comic relief, by far. There's a laugh every time he appears on screen. One thing that's noticeably lacking is that Jane Foster and friends aren't in it. And, honestly, good. The romance on Earth was easily the worst thing about the previous Thor movies. There are a few scenes on Earth, including a funny one with Doctor Strange. It is quite different from the other Thor movies, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The post-credits scene, though... really got us ready for what's to come.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

","This movie is a lot of fun and so far the best of the Thor franchise. When the first one felt like a knight's tale, the second one like a middle age epos the third one now is the pure SciFi version in the tradition of Guardians of the Galaxy. Chris Hemsworth used a lot of self irony for his portrayal even more so than in the past installments which was refreshing. Cate Blanchett was a solid villain and obviously loved playing that role. it was far from challenging as it was rather one dimensional (with an interesting back story tho) but she was fierce and loved it and that totally translated to the audience. Tom Hiddelston was good and sneaky as always. He really is the perfect choice for the role of Loki and once again proves that. Mark Ruffalo was solid enough with some new characteristics of his character. Same goes to Idris Elba who created his role as a runaway outcast. Karl Urban was fun but the greatest new addition is Jeff Goldblum. Just awesome. I really hope we will see some more of his character in future. Tessa Thompson was also great and truly ass kicking. Really liked her performance and character. Loved to see Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange and it was a nice swan song for Anthony Hopkins. Taika Waiti was an inspired and probably brave choice for the director chair but it totally paid off. He created a wild, crazy and extremely colorful bag of fun that never loses its sense for self irony and is extremely playful with many superhero clichés. Great job. Great blockbuster.

1023,30 November 2019,supermaggie,3," No Thor-movie anymore
","My goodness, where do I start? Perhaps with the most tragic thing: this is not a Thor movie. Period. Starting with the obvious: The producers take away Thor's trademark: the great blond mane - we all know what this did with Samson, and for this series it is almost the kiss of death. But unfortunately it was to be expected, because while Hollywood has been continuously discriminating against blonde actresses (and has made Cinderella African-American, Dorothy of Oz a Latina, etcetc.), it recently occupied almost more blond male actor than ever before, but it was only a matter of time that this comes to an end; instead of actually treating everybody equal (with equal advantages and equal disadvantages for all), whites are successively eliminated and disenfranchised - and this is not propaganda, just the observation of a propaganda taking place - and since they cannot replace the actor for the Nordic God ( naturally and authentically a blond actor) after several films and make him African-American / ... all of a sudden, they can at least cut his hair so short that it looks almost dark. (The fact that at least one blonde actress was cast with Cate Blanchett is good in itself, but more likely due to the New Zealand director than the discretion of Hollywood, and besides, she is allowed to participate only dyed black and portraying the ultimate evil; and in addition: the Valkyrie is hispanic - for real? That's an affront to all the Nordic nations, and if you did that with legends of nations of a different color, there would be rebellions, but you're obviously allowed to do that to white people, because nobody cares, and if they protest and try to defend themselves, they'll wrongfully and inappropriately be called Nazis). And then there is the problem that even with a crop it still remains a handsome blond actor, so he must be mutilated and lose an eye, I guess this is than okay/enough for the time being for today's political Hollywood. The fact that the quality and attraction of the films and the storytelling and the authenticity thereby completely perish does not matter anymore anyway. Only money and political propaganda still count. But that alone does not completely destroy Thor 3 yet. Three Australian and New Zealand actors in the main cast and a New Zealand director - and it turns into a surreal-poor Mad Max - Thunderdome-ish musical, only (fortunately) without singing. The whole series thus degenerates into a farce and great actors like Jeff Goldblum are degraded to a fool. You can actually spare another Thor movie.

Second, the characters of the leading roles and supporting roles were really impressed, For example, Skurge surrendered to Hela at first for saving his life, but his mind told him to fight for Ascar. As a result, he fought for those people, not just for atonement, but for his honor. 
Third, the soundtrack was arranged so well, so that I enjoyed in this movie a lot. Take an example. The final war at Ascar, the song was so exciting for audiences.

","This movie begins with ""Thor"" (Chris Hemsworth) having been captured by a giant demon named ""Surtur"" (a CGI with the voice of Clancy Brown) who intends to kill him very soon. But before doing this Surtur tells Thor that his father ""Odin"" (Anthony Hopkins) has mysteriously abandoned Asgard which will now allow him to fulfill the prophecy known as Ragnorok and thereby entirely destroy that vaunted realm. Fortunately, Thor manages to escape from his chains and quickly seizes the crown of Surtur--which is the main catalyst for initiating Ragnorok--and then departs before Surtur can attempt to recover it. What Thor doesn't know is that Odin is extremely ill and upon his death his powerful and extremely evil daughter ""Hela"" (Cate Blanchett) will be released from imprisonment and lay claim to the throne of Asgard-which is possibly even worse than the possibility of Ragnorok ever was. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an entertaining movie which contained ample amounts of action and comedy. Unfortunately, some of the comedy seemed a bit unnecessary and the numerous subplots sometimes made it difficult to follow as well. But all in all it was an entertaining film for the most part and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

","Growing up I was a DC kid - Superman, Batman, The Flash, Superboy etc. etc. Since The Marvel Universe and the DC Universe have been releasing movies I have been far more impressed with the Marvel movies than the DC ones. I really like Batman vs Superman, I liked Batman Begins a lot but couldn't see why The Dark Night was rated so highly. Man Of Steel was OK and I enjoyed Justice League but none of those movies compare to Marvel's output. I love (what seems to be) the approach in marvel movies where humor always has a place, there mostly seems a good balance between drama, action and humor and the Thor movies and Iron Man movies typify that best of all due to Robert Downey Jnr. and Chris Hemsworth. The two actors bring personalities to the table that I have never seen in a DC movie. Thor Ragnarok has a higher degree of humor than average and it really adds another layer when watching this movie. Tom Hiddleston also helps make this movie with his understated yet really enjoyable performance - you never know if he loves his brother or is simply setting him up but his character is always charming and you can't help pulling for him a bit. This movie does go some way in clarifying their relationship. Karl Urban as Skurge, Idris Elba as Heimdall and Cate Blanchett as Hela all support the main characters wonderfully well. The movie is a total joy from start to finish but there's one thing I haven't yet mentioned: The director, Taika Waititi, says that about 65% of the movie was improvised. What an excellent approach. If you have the actors capable of carrying that off then you have something special and the actors in Thor Ragnarok all step right up and make the movie one of the best superhero movies I've seen.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

","I consider a rating of 7 to be a good watchable movie, but it has some flaws. The big flaw is how humourous many of the scenes are. While this does make the movie quite enjoyable for the most part, it also, breaks immersion. I do like humour in almost all films to make it an enjoyable experience and to encourage re-watchabilty; but I dont like movies of this type to be overly satirical. The Avengers and Captain America have humour, but is still serious, and immersive. The scene at the very beginning is very over the top to express this type of comedic humour, and while it does provoke a few laughs, it is too silly to include in this type of film.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

However, that's on sheer entertainment because as I read some things on this film I realized the sheer dept and fan service they pay to true comic fans. I was always a DC Comics kid so I miss a lot of the Easter eggs but Marvel fans must be over the moon. The film also is much more comedic than others in the Universe, above and beyond what would normally be there and honestly (especially in the beginning) it felt a little forced.

What they were left with were properties that were well-known but were not the moneymakers of a Spider-Man or an X-Men. And Disney turned dirt into solid gold.

Hemsworth looks to be having more fun here than in any other of his previous outings as the hero, and both Blanchett and Goldblum have a whale of a time in their colorful supporting roles.

","I had concerns after Ragnarok's trailers. Not because they were weak, but more the opposite: I worried that the finished product couldn't live up to the steep expectations they'd set. That, and I had anxiety that the out-of-nowhere neon '80s theme would be a thin, superficial gimmick, slapped on to ride a trend and nothing more. In both respects, I couldn't have been more wrong. The trailer's just the tip of the iceberg for this epic, sprawling, colorful, unabashedly hilarious joyride of an adventure. It does the big blockbuster moments well, with power and meaning and a shiver-inducing use of Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song"" in two key spots. The dialog is right on-point for the duration, looser and more conversational than any of the previous Marvel films. Credit director Taika Waititi for that, allowing the cast to ad-lib freely in nearly every scene. Sakaar, a new planet that doubles as hub for all the universe's discarded crap, is a day-glow fantasy that would've been right at home in one of the Guardians of the Galaxy movies. In that setting, the retro graphics and glitchy synth score (a wonderful contribution from Devo frontman Mark Mothersbaugh) feel natural, and we're able to enjoy a fresh perspective on the Avengers' resident lightning-slinger. It does attempt to do an awful lot - I haven't even mentioned Cate Blanchett's sinister turn as this week's dark flavor - and that gives the first hour a rather scattered, random personality.

","There are three elements I see in these new CGI Era movies which have been getting more & more powerful as the technology & The Techniques to use it mature. In my opinion Marvel Studios is very close to perfecting technique for this new Era of movies. Two of the elements are as old as movies; Music & dialogue. The third; CGI is only a couple three decades old. Previously many CGI driven movies have been dominated by Eye-Candy; Using the CGI as the main character & skimping on the rest of the movie. As an off/on computer gamer I can tell you that Eye-Candy will only get you so far. This makes for very pretty but unsatisfying movies. Call these latest Marvel Studios Movies ""THE RETURN OF SHOWMANSHIP."" What has been REBORN is the skillful addition of Music & Dialogue with a healthy dose of craftsmanship. Not only This Movie here but other Marvel shows such as Guardians of The Galaxy. Trademarks of classic Hollywood movies were snappy, clever dialogue, well integrated music & pure craftsmanship. Music really stands out here; this new style of movie is sometimes a MUSIC VIDEO. How many generations are we now into MTV & music videos? Some of the battle scenes with Led Zeppelins 'Immigrant Song' are absolutely stunning & they are MUSIC VIDEOS TOO. Music is every bit as powerful, no more powerful, than any CGI Eye Candy. The Guardians of the Galaxy Movies go even further in this direction. Plenty of old favorite songs (mine anyway) & lots of them. These movies ARE Musicals in a way. 'Sound of Music' has it's place but SO STICKY SWEET; man nothing Rocks in there. The old tradition of snappy Hollywood Dialogue has been sadly neglected too. I am always laughing out loud at some sly clever line in these latest Marvel Movies. Even Jeff Goldblum's voice as 'Grandmaster' cracks me up. Old 30's & 40's movies had lots of cool snappy lines. It really went downhill after The Schwarzenegger movies with their ""One Big Line"" like ""I'll be Back. later there were not even any,""One big Lines"". Doesn't take much to find & hire some good, clever writers; get a clue. Don't misunderstand me CGI has become an increasingly more powerful tool but these movies restore the balance & really advance the artform. One thing It is Very Hard for any Flesh & Blood actor to stand up to CGI & not be dwarfed by it on screen; That means Actors like Goldblum, Blanchette & Hopkins. This type of movie I call 'Rollercoaster Style'; Designed like a thrill park ride. All action, frantic action with no let-up. Makes for great old time escapism. Movies are supreme at escape.

I love the humor in this movie! I think Marvel Studios created something unique (in comparison to their other releases) and I appreciate the overall laid-backness of the film.

There is plenty of witty, knowing dialog (starting with the captured Thor's conversation with the demon Surtur), along with some great physical humor (such as when Bruce Banner does the pratfall of all time on the bridge at Asgard) that never descends to the level of parody, camp or snark. At the same time, it is still a film very much part of the Marvel movie canon, as the story brings some major changes to world of Thor and Loki, not to mention Asgard itself.

","""Thor: Ragnarok"" (2017), following the disappointment of ""Thor: The Dark World"" (2013), I didn't really care if a third ""Thor"" movie came out. So, when I saw the first trailer for ""Thor: Ragnarok"", I didn't really have any hopes for it at all. I had a feeling that it was going to suck, and sure enough I was right. Granted, it's not as bad as ""Thor: The Dark World"", but it has it's own level of mediocrity. It has a very stupid and inconsistent storyline, the acting is joke, all of the sets/locations are dull and the soundtrack is predictable. The plot is, Thor gets imprisoned on planet Sakaar and must find a way back to Asgard to stop the destruction of his realm at the hands of powerful and ruthless Hela. Now, that story may sound basic enough, which is a must for a successful action film. However, in the case of this ""movie"", it's way too simple and it results in the ""film"" dragging on for way too long. Seriously, for the majority of these 130 minutes, next to nothing happens. The only interesting parts are; when Thor fights Hulk and when he later discovers the extent of his powers. Other than that, it's just a stupid and unfunny romp. It's nothing but an onslaught of jokes, one-liners and situations. That's all well and good, but the writers forgot a small detail. They forgot to make it funny! ""Thor: The Dark World"" at least tried to take itself seriously, even though it didn't work. But, ""Thor: Ragnarok"" goes way over-the-top and gets to the point where you just don't care anymore and you're desperate for something exciting to happen. The best way I can describe this ""film"", is by using one word, stupid. Yes, this is easily one of the dumbest movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe! Don't get me wrong, I love ""stupid films"" as long as they're entertaining. ""Thor: Ragnarok"" had some okay moments here and there, but overall, it was just yet another letdown. One of the biggest things that sparked my interest in seeing it, was because Thor and Bruce Banner were going to team up. That's a cool idea! Unfortunately, the writers still managed to screw it up. How is that possible? It's a crying shame, because I really wanted to like this ""movie"". But, all I got was a film where I sat and wondered why they bothered if they weren't even going to try. As for the acting, it's a mixed bag from the whole entire cast. The only ones who seem to be trying here, are: Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Tom Hiddleston and Cate Blanchett. Everyone else is nothing but average, to just plain horrible. Not even Jeff Goldblum could save it! Yep, they somehow dragged him into this nonsense. Everyone else just does a lousy job with their acting! One issue I feel I need to point out, is that as the Marvel films went on, Thor just seemed to get dumber and dumber, which is really irritating. That being said, Chris Hemsworth still does the best he can with the poorly written script he's forced to work with. Thor started out as an intriguing character. However, as time goes on, he just seems to get more and more stupid. It's like the writers hate him and are going out of their way to try and humiliate him! Any way, let's go ahead and move on. All of the sets/locations are boring and give the ""film"" a dull atmosphere. Some of the sets are okay, but overall, they just make the ""movie"" look all the more boring to watch. The soundtrack is about as generic and predictable as you can get. Mark Mothersbaugh wrote the film score this time. It's not as bad as the one in ""Thor: The Dark World"". But at the end of the day, it's just not that good. The best possible way I can describe it is, lazy. Why? Because it just sounds like it was rushed together at the last minute. For example, the repetitive inclusions of ""The Immigrant Song"", by Led Zeppelin. Now, I love that song, it's fantastic! But, using the same song multiple times further justifies the laziness in the editing department. The only positive I can muster out of this dumb excuse of a ""movie"", is the special effects. All of them are well-done and still hold up to this day. Which is no surprise, seeing how it came out in 2017! ""Thor: Ragnarok"" is quite simply an pile of garbage in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the superhero genre in general. It may not be the worst superhero movie I've ever seen. But, it's still by my standards, a bad film. I'm giving this ""movie"" 1 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 2 out of 10 IMDB stars. Just avoid this ""film"" like the disaster it is. ""Thor: Ragnarok"" is a huge diarrhea stain in the world of cinema. Before you all tell me to watch ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" (2022), let me just say this. I will never subject myself to the worthless and pointless cash-grabs they make after the release of ""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019). All of those dumb movies are fake and taint the whole entire Infinity Saga. Any way, ""Thor: Ragnarok"" is a waste of time. It deserves to be banished forever and never be seen again!",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

I do think it was effective in being much lighter, and it was genuinely quite funny, with great visuals and good action sequences.

Bringing Hela in was really cool, but she was never anything more than a token evil power-hungry person. I love Bruce's struggles with his Hulk side, but why he went to Sakaar, why he was the Hulk nonstop for 2 years, and how they brought him out were all poorly explained.

Besides, the character of the movie are developing in such way they meet each other, coincidentally, or planned. This is what makes you will stay awake from the beginning until the end. Thor: Ragnarok is not just about the battle of Ragnarok, but also the battle of every battle that superhero may die for it: The extinction of their people and how every relation could be pure again with patience and love.

1235,18 January 2019,rryweck,9," Thor: Ragnarok Hammers Out A Hit
","Despite how poorly directed and filmed the movies Thor and Thor: The Dark World were, the third movie in the franchise, Thor: Ragnarok, brings comedy, action, and new characters to the table. Thor: Ragnarok is beautifully filmed and directed by Taika Waititi, who had previously acted in the unfortunate movie The Green Lantern. Not only did Waititi direct and produce the film, but he also starred in it as a side character, Korg. I find this movie fascinating due to its marvelous acting, comical script, and astonishing photography.
This movie is about Thor's struggle to defeat his older sister, Hela, the Goddess of Death. This journey takes him to multiple planets where he meets new and old characters. Thor starts out in the Underworld where he fights a demon named Surtur who was prophesied to destroy his home. Later on in Sakaar, Thor gets reunited with the Hulk and meets new heroes such as Valkyrie and Korg. While Thor was stuck on another planet, Hela was planning on taking over all realms in the universe. She raised her army of dead soldiers and her giant wolf Fenris. With the help of his friends, Thor escapes Sakaar and flies back to Asgard. Thor and his friends take on Hela and her army. As they struggle to fight them, Loki, his brother, shows up with an army of prisoners from Sakaar. Thor then fights Hela, and while he does so, he uses his true powers to help fight her. He strikes her with a lightning bolt. Unable to defeat his sister, Thor had nothing else to turn to, but I will not spoil the ending for you.
One thing I enjoyed about this film was the incredible acting. Chris Hemsworth, who had taken on the role of Thor four times before (Thor, Thor: The Dark World, Avengers, and Avengers: Age of Ultron), used his superhero experience to create an amazing, lively, hilarious character in the latest Thor movie. Not only did Hemsworth portray a perfect Thor character, but he even improved from the previous movies from the franchise. Hemsworth wasn't the only talented actor that was thrown into the mix. Actors such as Tom Hiddleston (Thor, Thor: The Dark World), Cate Blanchett (Carol, The Gift), Mark Ruffalo (The Hulk, The Avengers), and Tessa Thompson (Creed) also starred in the film. Although Mark Ruffalo is an extremely accomplished actor, his role in this movie lacked some personality. I personally believe that he could have put a little more effort into his performance. On the other hand as a newer actress in Hollywood, Tessa Thompson had a giant role to fill. Although her experience is limited, Thompson was not a let down. She couldn't have been a better fit for the part. From her snarky looks to her skillful fighting, Thompson was the best Valkyrie possible.
Another great thing that was added to the movie were the classic Marvel cameos. Of course, none other than Stan Lee himself was the one who gave Thor a haircut. Dr. Stephen Strange played by Benedict Cumberbatch (Dr. Strange, The Imitation Game) had also appeared in the beginning of the film. Once in Asgard, Thor witnessed a play that was being put on about Loki's tragic death. The actor who played Loki was actually Matt Damon (Jason Bourne, The Martian) and Thor was actually played by Hemsworth's least known brother, Luke Hemsworth (Hickok, The Anomaly).
Lastly I loved the way they filmed the movie, the effects and photography were absolutely superb. Waititi, the director, used brilliant colors and astounding special effects to draw in the viewer. All the effects blended in seamlessly, all scenes connected perfectly together. Not only were the effects great, but Waititi showed both sides to the confrontation. At some points, the movie would only focus on what Thor and his allies were doing, and then on the other side, viewers would get to see the devious plans Hela had for the Universe. Waititi used his special effects to also create some of the most iconic entrance scenes in Marvel history. When entering the fight with Hela, Thor dropped down from the sky in slow motion, lightning bolts crackling and exploding from his skin. Valkyrie entered by walking, also in slow motion, along the beautiful rainbow bridge, dressed in her iconic warrior uniform, with gigantic fireworks exploding in the background. Although some of the entrances were serious yet prodigious, Waititi decided to put some comedy back into the way he filmed this movie. The Hulk's entrance was my favorite one of all. He started off as Bruce Banner, observing Fenris from a spaceship. Banner decided to aid in the fight by taking on Fenris and releasing the Hulk. So he jumped out of the plane, and without turning into the Hulk, Banner crashed onto the bridge and laid there until he was able to turn.
One of the key themes to this movie is peace. In every Marvel movie, the goal of the hero is to create peace within the world. Each hero has to defeat a villain that comes their way in order to keep harmony in the universe. Another major theme within this movie is power. Throughout the movies Thor: The Dark World and Thor: Ragnarok, Loki and Thor had power disputes. Loki wanted to take control over the throne, he even pretended to be King Odin. However, in this film it is Hela who truly wants to seize power of the throne. Although Loki, Hela, and Thor all fight about power, Thor doesn't really care about being king. He just wants the best for his people. In the end, Thor ends up as the newest King of Asgard.
In conclusion I find this movie to be one of the best movies in the Marvel movie series. I enjoy watching this movie because not only does it tell the story of a hero, but it takes the viewer on an extremely fun and adventurous journey through different realms. This film was also enjoyable because of the way the director wrote the script and executed the movie.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

Thor's romantic relationship with Jane has run its course and other baggage that limited where the stories could go has been cut away. And crucially, the writers have gone for a strong dose of humour that is thankfully more along the lines of the Avengers and Iron Man franchises (rather than the pre-adolescent level that weakened Guardians 1 and sunk Guardians 2). After all, if the franchise is to be free to follow potentially preposterous directions, it's essential to lace it all with humour that keeps the ball rolling and doesn't take itself too seriously - which I gather spoiled some people's full enjoyment of the first two in the series.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

","Thor Ragnarok is an unexpectedly funny return to the Thor trilogy. By far the best of the trilogy Ragnarok stands out because of its humor and color scheme. Many fans have complained that over the years Marvel films have acquired a generic feel and tone, however, Ragnarock is all style. The movie is one of the best looking Marvel films, besides the Guardians movies. It is also very humorous but juxtaposes that humor with some very great character moments that I haven't seen in a Marvel film in a long time. It's because of this blend of action, comedy, and drama that I think this movie is worthwhile. However, the movie is a bit unmemorable. Although it will have major ramifications in the MCU, it never felt very serious. The steaks in this movie are not high enough to get one invested really deeply in the overall plot. If it weren't for the humor, visuals and key moments between the characters we love, I honestly would've rated this lower since really the steaks diminish the overall plot of the film. Having said that, the villain was passable due to some connections to the main characters. Overall I believe this film is really cool, although not groundbreaking. It's not the best film in the MCU but it sure is fun. Final score 7/10",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

Thor has no emotions when his Best Asgardians friends all die, the death of Odin is a wasteful cheap scene that was not written well, you could tell the writers had no idea what to do for this movie, they even admitted that 80% of the movie was improvised.. Hela was probably the best thing in the movie, she did a fabulous acting i really liked her but her role was so minimal, yes we do know shes the main villain in here but her story was another waste replaced by jokes in the movie. Loki was downgrade so much in this movie, Loki who fought the Avengers, the god of Mischief, lowered down by Valkyrie, or should i say "" a"" Valkyrie, which does not justice neither on the actual Valkyrie character of the comic book. The planet Hulk crossover waste useless and could have been taken out, it did however give Thor the recognition it deserve for fighting Hulk as it should be. Ragnarok was a bad as Homecoming where in the end Thor does not defeat Hela... and worse does not even save Asgard. SO much for the build up on his god of thunder awakening Raiden like powers. He literally did Raiden's move from Mortal Kombat... the god of thunder who did not even lose his powers, just his hammer, still gets tasered by a tiny device...

She literally kills in the movie, and we can see her motivation and feel her anger. But that is to be expected for an actress of Blanchett's caliber. What is astounding is that she actually delivers in spades. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk also gets to shine in this movie, and for once he seems an integral character to the movie, not just a side character. We even see Idris Elba's Heimdall get some action too. Tom Hiddleston's Loki is still intriguing, and has brilliant chemistry with Hemsworth's Thor; as always. In short, this is one movie where all important characters get to shine and showcase their awesomeness.

","This is a tonally confused conclusion to a tonally confused trilogy. Despite enjoying his role in The Avengers, I never liked the Thor standalone films. Knowing that, I approached this one with a degree of the cynicism I wish I'd had walking into the other two. In this regard, I'm amazed that I managed to be let down anyway.
Like Iron Man 3 or, indeed, the first Thor movie, the story is entirely secondary to how many jokes they can make. This worked for The Guardians of the Galaxy or Fox's Deadpool, but they had the advantage of making up for thin, predictable plots with being funny (even after multiple viewings). But, in this case, the ongoing attempt at humour is largely restricted to ""Expectation vs. Reality"" sight gags or acts of out-of-character incompetence and buffoonery that ruin the tension and lessen the stakes. In effect, the film deflates itself and it's epic mythological roots in favour of ""safely"" playing off the events of the Norse endtimes as a comedy for small children. 
Despite a slew of respected veteran actors, many of the cast seem to be either reading the script off of a teleprompter in real-time for the camera or have been asked to self-deprecatingly improvise in favour of any of the three screenwriters to actually finish a scene. Hemsworth, Hiddleston and Ruffalo are all at total lowpoints for their Marvel characterizations thus far, more seeming to be personally goofing off on the occasion that I believe a word they're saying. Again, the pervasive levity renders it impossible to take anything seriously. 
The only reason that this is getting so generous a score is that the visual effects were entirely adequate. Not good, adequate. At it's best, this film is functional. But, on average, it's a choppy mess with mediocre acting from people who desperately deserve a much better script. If you feel the need to not miss any possible reference points in Infinity War, then you could waste your time on something worse, but a technically inferior picture would probably prove more entertaining in a perverse way. It's no weaker than it's titular predecessors, but that means little in the way of enjoyability.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

","Ratings and reviews are subjective. Some prefer their coffee black. Others with cream and sugar. This adventure resonated with me on the never-a-dull-moment scale of entertainment. I have a female roommate who said it wasn't her cup of tea (to mix metaphors). For your average male, the muscular, masculine, handsome and charismatic Thor tickles our primal caveman id. For sure, he brings out the kid in us who always fantasizes about being Superman (to mix franchises). And for women ... do I really need to explain the appeal? But this is a love story between two brothers. Tom Hiddleston's portrayal of Loki is simply mesmerizing. Most comic book characters tend to be, well, cartoony simplistic. Not here. Quite the opposite as we watch the myriad machinations of his internal struggle between good and evil. And Hemsworth's comedic turn here shows his growth as an actor, the dueling banter between Thor and Loki the magical thread that holds it all together. It is so easy to misstep the delicate balance between humor, farce and Marvel-esque SFX action plot -- here where two beguiling villains, evil sister Hela (Cate Blanchett) and the acerbic sadist Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum) vie for control of the universe. Blanchett hugs her narcissist role with obvious delight, getting the chance to play the villain of a lifetime as a black-haired amazon in skin tight spandex and a headdress that puts Maleficent to shame. ""Bow to your queen!"" She is the empowered female counterpart to Thor for the Me generation. Please note that was meant tongue-in-cheek. I seldom if ever give 9 stars.

He would retire to what was known as the ""Odinsleep"", which he could not be awakened from under any circumstances, which made an excellent plot foundation for the true Marvel Ragnarok series (lasted quite a few issues). Destroying the beauty of Asgard and sticking the refugees in Norway was sad and pathetic. Disney has no concept of thinking ahead. There was so much more to Asgard than the tiny role it was given in the Marvel movies thus far. Like the Gods, immortal Asgardians and the location, it was supposed to be eternal.

This was, as so many others noted, Thor Meet Guardians of the Galaxy"".
The humor is not funny .... sure, some moments had me laugh, but most of the laughs were of the pitying kind...... just lame jabs and really cheesy one-liners that wouldn't have made it to the screen of ""Mork & Mindy"" or ""Family Ties"" or even ""Home Improvements"". It takes REAL skill and talent, like that of Johnny Carson, to make bad jokes work.
This film didn't.
Even the VERY cliched use of Cate Blanchett .... what a supreme waste of talent! .... she was nothing more than a Sauron-ized version of Galadriel in this.
Even the CGI ... so very cheezy! The worst was the iconized Odin and the even worse Gladiator sequence between Thor and The Hulk.
It seemed to me that this director - or was it someone else's fault?? - simply stole the best bit from numerous other superbly done classics and hashed them together in this hot mess.
Sorry, but A Major Disappointment ..... I will not longer continue with the Star Trek reboot, the latest Star Wars and now Thor. This is what you get from a generation which has no roots in the classics - American, English and World - and who can't even manage cursive writing because it ""is a waste of time""! 
This film, sadly is a waste of time.
The only bigger waste of time I can envision is sitting through the 'new' version of ""A Star is Born"" due out later this year. A Rhodes scholar and the most amazing vocal and creative talent of the 20th Century are cookie-cutted by an excruciatingly 2-D offering. Barbra Streisand had the chops to step into the shoes of Judy Garland and create an enervating NEW and fresh version of a Hollywood classic. Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga only manage to pull off what was offered here in ""Thor: Ragarok"" .... a pale, insipid and very weak imitation of Hollywood ART - I am not even going to hope for sublime.

However I have seen the other 2 Thor movies and as such this is the best or at least the most entertaining one of the bunch. It leans heavy on the comedy side of things and there is the strength and the weakness of the movie. Obviously Marvel and Disney have found that it pays to be funny. Unfortunately they haven't got it completely right. And the fact that you have a truck load of money to waste on nothing doesn't mean you can make it any good. It's just plain lucky the other 2 were bad that in comparison this one looks better but in reality it is just average. Do not expect to be dazzled by the story, the visuals, the scenery or anything else you may want to be flabbergasted by. This is another one you have seen without having to see it. The formula gets old but I guess that as long as they cash in big time they will be made. There is nothing wrong with that but why not take a chance, try something different or just spent some time for a better story or at least a better dialogue.

1400,26 February 2018,gigitville,8," Finally a Good Thor Movie
","So, this movie completely revamped the Thor series, which was direly needed. The first two Thor films were decent in certain ways, but fell flat compared to stand alone films like Iron Man or Captain America. But Ragnarok was so good. It took an entirely comedic approach which surprisingly didn't feel out of place, probably because it was done by someone who had a confidence in their vision. Taika Watiti is a fantastic director. 
Starting with some of the cons, since this was more of a comedy, and since it was done well, some of the jokes actually felt a little cheap in comparison to others. For example, in the first scene when Thor is talking to Surtur and spins in the chains during the discussion. The first time viewing, it was pretty funny. But it wasn't the type of humor that aged well with multiple viewings. This was sprinkled throughout the film, but luckily not the main sense of humor. The main sense of humor was cleverer, i.e. Korg who was one of the best parts of the movie with his oddly chipper New Zealander voice, played by Taika Watiti. Speaking of, I wish he had complete creative control, because you could see at times where the studios were whispering in his ear of what the movie ""should"" have. I really wish they developed Cate Blanchett and her character more. The way she played the character varied a bit scene to scene, which could be chalked up to the studios interfering with the directing and writing. And the villain itself should've been given some more depth. Come on, Marvel. I know you can't go back into previous Marvel movies and change things, but it would've been nice to see Thor actually use lightning earlier in the Cinematic Universe. Though, one could argue that his abilities change as he discovers more about himself. There should've been more of the story taking place on Sakaar, since it was such an interesting world that was actually well developed. 
It was where the movie really embraced itself was where it was most successful. The weird and funny moments were its strongest supporters of the story. The color was also great, and just the whimsical tone actually felt more Thor. His character is a stubborn and arrogant prince in the first film, and in Dark World, an argument can be made that that was where he was dealing with some internal conflict, and now, after spending time with the Avengers on earth, the more fun tone is fitting since he's loosened up. It surprisingly fit well with the timeline of Thor. And it was refreshing that Thor was trying to save his world, but had to change his game plan, and Asgard ended up destroyed. The way they used color in the film with Loki makes me hopeful. He wasn't in his usual green and black, the colors he always reverted back to when he would betray Thor, but he's in teal. This could represent that he's truly changed for good, and hopefully won't betray Thor again in Infinity War. 
Overall, fantastically enjoyable movie that was made extremely well by a director who had a vision. The clever sense of humor and 80's-esque music was awesome, as well as the completely badass second use of Immigrant Song with Thor using lightning.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

","When I go and watch a movie one of the things that I want is the film to be fun. And this film Thor: Ragnarok, is a very fun ride for me. The director ,Taika Waititi excellently blends his style of comedy, seen in his previous work like the Hunt for the Wilderpeople and What We Do in the Shadows, with the action and formula seen in the previous Marvel films. Where the other Thor Films fell short because of their overly serious tone and lack of interesting environments for the characters to interact with. Ragnarok does the opposite, taking some ques form other Marvel movies like Guardians of the Galaxy , the film adopts a very fun and ridiculous tone. Introducing characters like Jeff Goldblum's Grandmaster, who is a classic Goldblum Character with his fast-talking wit and charm, the psychopathic leader of the planet is played in a way that makes me excited when he is on screen as he is that magnetic in the role. Also, the reinvention of the character of Thor himself. Making him a fun-loving and witty character as he has the character in the past has been often forgettable in the previous films, often being outshined by the comic reliefs or the other characters with more to them. Waititi takes his previous experience of working on small New Zealand independent comedies and translated the storytelling method to the big budget action films of Marvel. He maintains the themes of his previous work to make the action franchise better. The themes of outcasts of a society trying to fit into a world that does not get them is strong in this film as Thor quite literally has to fight for his freedom in the film. Thor: Ragnarok is a different Marvel Movie, instead of a flashy action movie concerned with special effects and the battle for the fate of the world, the film tells a human story of finding someone's own identity through tragedy and the classic Marvel action and set pieces, all while being an amazingly fun ride.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

","Enjoyable and funny with Lord of the Rings thrilling overtones, but was this movie sponsored by the alcohol industry? It is unclear what the principal female protagonist is drinking as she fights alongside Thor, but she drinks...a lot. And when Thor suggests she give it up, she is adamant she will continue drinking. In the opening scene she is clearly inebriated. The writers may as well had her knitting, or smoking substances, sniffing, or even injecting- it wouldn't have made any difference to her actions, motivations, nor the plot. It was totally gratuitous. So why did the writers have her drinking to excess and render her character impervious to this? Was this to make her appear more powerful, or cool? With millions of viewers being young tweenies, and with her character seeming to personify female empowerment and independence, could she be inspirational or a role model? Does this movie undermine the millions (if not billions globally) of dollars spent on campaigns to encourage safe drinking? Key message from this movie: let's all drink flagons of wine/spirits in one hit just like she does!

","Positives: -Nice colour palette.- loki and the executioner were thruthfully and respectfully portayed.- Fast pace throughout the movie. Negatives:- humor is repelling against audience: Loki could have sat right next to you in the cinema without you knowing it. Absorbing what he felt when shooting the movie.- Why dr Strange was only a great bartender in the movie?- Why the hulk talks and has almost the same face as his alter ego? I mean they are totaly different characters. -Why a scientist stays angry for 2 years? He probably knew the outcome of the movie. -Why the film looks like they have adopted many similar acting or looking characters from many other movies? Why Loki doesn't have a great power and name? He's family too.- Why many movies nowadays are familiar with benzodiazapines for too long, including this one? You expect some emotion in this future Disney.- If the makers incorperated dr Strange more in the movie, making realms and unknown realms or making them surrealistic and mysterious and darker could be a bigger entree. Under the pressure of a sinister Hela with emotional deathtraps making it creepier and more thrilling with what's next to come. Something like what Carrie turned out to be in the remake: a superhero with revenge, but with certain drive. And Thor would be the other end: emotionally doing what is right for Hela, himself and the twisted Loki in honour of the pride of their father and Asgard.- Thor also ditched the girlfriend in a local pub on earth with pleasure. Why? She's the one who would have kept the jokes out of the movie. At least for a while.- One other good thing in this movie were no big ships entering realms. Unfortunately it's been replaced by a big wolf who could have ate 10 Hulks for diner with ease.

1419,17 November 2017,esthercross,," This film was pure gold(blum)
","It is one of those marvellous films that place no strain on your focus because it is relentlessly entertaining. It still looks very much like a marvel film but has somehow managed to achieve a superb balance of combining the dry humoured, quirky identity of a smaller Waititi film with the large marvel proportions. There seemed to be a different comedic set up in each scene almost like a sketch show and in general the film felt almost more like a comedy then an action film in terms of genre. It was really great to see Chris Hemsworth showing his skills as a comedy actor and it wasn't just down to the moments of genius within the written dialogue as Hemsworth shows he has a really funny instinct and great use of physical humour. A great quality of the film too was how meta and self deprecating the characters where and it gave the villains in particular more depth. This was particularly in the case of 'Hella' (Cate Blanchett). Hellas darkness and power are presented alongside moments that ridicule her failed attempts to demand respect. The film also uses its special effects in a spectacularly creative ways. When Hellas Hair turns to horns it is a beautifully fluid action that for some reason caused certain people in the screen I was in to exclaim ""GO KATE"" I don't think they necessarily thought it was the actress's personal skill, but I understand the sentiment. her whole performance was great! there is something about her which really commands your full focus whenever she is on screen. My only criticism would be I would have liked to have seen more Blanchet. I also really felt with this film that the SciFi moments where constructed with great tangibility. Everything in this film looked touchable and correctly weighted which is rare for a glossary high CGI Blockbuster. There is a visually interesting scene taking place in a festival for the Hulk and everything looked like a real life spectacle and yet had the convincing feel of a far away planet. I think what Waititi proves with this film is that he is very accomplished as an action director as well as with comedy as he uses the action sequences to showcase his creative ingenuity. In a flash back scene the texture of the action is that of an old dramatic oil painting in which a fight involving the Valkyries is taking place. The dramatic lighting design in this scene beautifully impressive. Whether a marvel nerd a Waititi fan a comedy snob or just someone who needs escaping into another world for a few hours; this film is well worth the watch!",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

","I feel that I may be witch hunt out of existence for my thoughts on this film. While I was certainly entertained during my viewing of this film, I was a bit shocked at some of the creative choices done by Marvel for this movie. Ragnorok is the event in Norse mythology that is the end of all things. This turns into a comedy club. While I certainly laughed during this movie, I felt that the tone was rather off. I loved the part of the film that took place on Sakarr (Grandmaster was by far my favorite thing about this film) and anything with Heimdall but I felt that scenes on Asgard, particularly with Hela were a bit out of place. Everyone in this film was a comedian. Thor is a stoic warrior not a jokester. The tone felt much better suited for a different character such as Spider-man or Ant-man. I was also shocked when Hulk started talking and holding conversations with Thor. Thor acts like this was a normal occurrence for them as we haven't seen anything to my memory outside of roaring and the occasional ""hulk smash"" or ""puny god"". I feel that this was certainly an entertaining film but there were some points where special effects were rather distracting (such as the scene with Thor's hammer as well as the special effects used for Thor's eye). There were also inconsistencies with powers especially with Hela. We see her massacre an army of Asgardian warriors but when it's time for our protagonists to fight her she suddenly forgets she can shoot knives and she decides to punch it out with Thor. There's also the terrible scene of her just walking towards the heroes on the Bifrost. I saw this movie opening weekend and I've just been letting it marinate in my head since. I seem to dislike it more each time I think about it. I was already a bit iffy about it while in the theater (starting with the first scene of Thor spinning around on chains) and each time I try to put together a coherent plot of this film, I end up more disappointed. I cannot find the true plan for Hela in this film. I feel that she really doesn't have a big evil plan. At least this film didn't end with a big blue beam in the sky.

","The twenty sixth entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Thor: Ragnarok is a mixed bag. While the casting, as always, is perfect in every way, much of the beginning of the film drags along. The pacing for the first hour or so of this movie is awfully slow, and it's hard to care about what's happening off Asgard as compared to what's happening on Asgard. The death of both Odin and Mjolnir is handled poorly, with one being treated as more of a joke then anything and the other just brushed through like it was nothing. While yes Odin's death has been built up to in both the previous Thor installments, it still should have been handled slower and not so briskly.

Not that Thor's saga is famous for being directed in an unobtrusive way, but from Ragnarock's saga, I honestly expected something different. What is perceived by seeing this chapter in the Thor saga and the total annihilation of the epic and poetry of what is a particular Hero and very different from the others, bound in an indissoluble manner to a strong and epic mythology. Everything in this movie becomes glitterous and stupidly irritating, transforming the atmosphere into an Action movie where you need to make the spectator laugh with any kind of joke, taking away the little credibility left to the Thor package. Once my position was clarified on this point, I would like to say that the actors seemed compelling and the special effects perfect without any banging. The plot that has been developed has no big flaws even though it's too trivial, even for a Marvel movie. I only regret that I have not witnessed a convincing and epic Final Chapter, which left room for an annoying comic spot spotted with special effects and music stubbornly 80. # Stop'80",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

It's always Easter in the Marvel universe, and I love movies with hidden eggs, which is why I so enjoy Marvel movies, including the Thor movies (each of which I found ingenious). Loki is typically my favorite character, but this time he got some competition from Jeff Goldblum's character, who brings a hilarious cult of personality to this movie. Some say Ragnarok is too humorous, as if any of us aren't guilty of laughing at our own inevitable fate. At least Thor also fights it (since that's what heroes do), but indeed Thor generally accepts his fate with the level of humor required to get the Grandmaster to acknowledge he's a good sport, and though that makes the movie amusing, it's not quite as absurd as some posters might wish to think.

1509,11 March 2019,amanojaku-38693,," Planet Hulk feat. Thor
","I adored the first two Thor movies. They had the right mix of humor and serious plot with well-timed jokes and excellent character development- something this film was severely lacking. Thor seemed to have regressed back to the Thor from the beginning of the first movie, when he was even the focus. Despite being the title character it felt like the main character of the movie was anybody but Thor. Hulk in particular got a lot of focus in the Planet Hulk portion of the movie, which really should have been its own movie rather than taking over Thor. vent though this film was the longest of the three Thor films it was so packed full of unnecessary filler that the parts of the movie that were actually important get glossed over, happening in the blink of an eye to move on to more lengthy filler nonsense. In addition to Thor, Loki was also very poorly written. The god of mischief and lies shouldn't be predictable. Tom Hiddleston is an amazing actor but even he can't save this movie from its bad writing. It felt like the writers had no idea how to write the characters so they just recycled what they saw in the previous movies.
Worse yet, this whole movie was overrun with bad humor, as though they had tried to shoehorn in as many jokes as humanly possible in the two hour run time. For the ""What was Thor doing during Civil War?"" short the humor worked and made me laugh but for a movie with so much death about the destruction of Asgard and the end of Asgardian civilization as we know it it should be far more serious. All the humor does is downplay the gravity of the situation and the ""comedic timing"" was such that serious situations got turned into jokes and ruined the whole moment. It got to a point where any joke made me cringed or groan in exasperation.
I went to Deadpool to see Deadpool. I didn't go to Thor to see Deadpool, but that's what I got and while Deadpool was great Thor Ragnarok was a complete dumpster fire.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

","This is the best attempt from marvel comics to make an Thor movie, by the way it's the best Thor movie from miles part compared to other ones. The things that I liked about the movie were the setup and continuity in the story which were missing from the previous movies. This is Chris Hemsworth's best performance since all the performance as the character, Tom Hiddleston was pure gold as Loki and Cate Blanchett ha set a bar for all the actors in the whole franchise and Tessa Thompson should also should be praised as she scored full marks when it comes to technicality of acting. Mark Ruffalo as Hulk was also great as Dr. Bruce Banner. About the story it was good that it was having some fluidity and cinematography was great as it is visual harmony. The director did a good job to make the movie simple and understandable as it could be, because other marvel movies forces you to watch there other presentations. The song preferences for the movie was also good and suits best for all the situations. The imagery was also really nice. The bunch of things that I didn't liked about this movie was Hulk/Bruce Banner as a character wasn't given more screen time or a backstory explanation about the character situation. Tessa Thomson/ Valkyrie was also not suffering from same issues as the Hulk which makes her performance very unrelatable(but the actress did her best to cover it/Full marks there). Overall there should be some backstory provided for all the incident. Many Characters from the previous movies like Idris Elba/Heimdall and Anthony Hopkins/Odin were not utilized properly. This sums up that only draw back about the movie is that there are many characters which were under-utilized and they shine because of there acting prowess. I wanted a explanation about Jeff Goldblum/Grandmaster's character which was not given.

","I agree with everyone who said this movie had too much comedy. I don't know what made them do this but this is indeed one of the worst MCU movie I've ever seen. It is so different than other films in MCU.
Every single action sence is just a joke. One of them was when Thor explaining the Valkyrie about the Asgard and took a red ball to smash the window. I hated that sence. From the beginning of the movie Thor acts like a fool. Where is the real God of Thunder? I don't see him in this film. I don't think MCU will survive if they make films like this. Comedy used to be fun in MCU because they were rare. Many Marvel fans may say that this is the best one yet but from my point of view, it is just a peace of useless overrated film.
The other things that are bad about this movie is that how Thor's friends die like they were nothing. Even Thor doesn't care about them. He never mentioned their name at once. Also the mythology is wrong which doesn't matter. But Thor absolutely becomes god of joke from god of thunder. Oh I almost forgot to mention about Jane. Jane is one of the important character in Thor trilogy. But now she is nothing more than a breakup joke. And I don't think I have to mention Hulk. The strongest Avenger in now a baby. Good job Marvel.
Overall this film is just pile of plastic. Feels like Marvel had to put out a film and they did. They didn't care about the plot or what so ever.
On the plus point, the story does continues. We get to see how the great battle is coming closer. Also we get to see Asgard being destroyed which is terrifying. And most sad part was seeing Thor's friend die and Odin's death. It's not that bad. But it hurts seeing favorite franchise not doing so well.

","I want to say that Chris Helm has proved he is a great actor, not just in Thor and the Avengers, but also as the Huntsman in Snow White and the Huntsman, he was really great in that, part 2 was not that great because they tampered with the whole idea of the snow white story, you can't do that and they tried to do an Elsa thing, ""let it snow"" I don't know, it didn't work that I do know. Does it mean Huntsman 3 can't be made? yes it can but it would have to be well scripted and carefully done, attention to detail is key, so perhaps some follow up with Snow White to find out what becomes of her or that he wanders into the story of sleeping beauty to help the prince battle that dragon without tampering too much with the story line, carefully and delicately (remember Malificent in Snow White is a dragon and she could return as the witch here to cause Sleeping beauty curse). Also did anyone see In the Heart of the Sea? The movie was dark and not for everyone but in every scene Chris stole each scene. Also he will reprise his role as George Kirk ( a major part I hope, where he will be there for most of the film) in the upcoming Quentin Star Trek which I hope will not include cursing or sexual scenes and be PG-14 for more violence only. I don't want Quentin to damage the purity of the characters but don't mind the characters an the story getting more intense especially with the Romulans, the Borgs, the whole story line as to why all the aliens are human-like needs to be answered! I also look forward to the return of Picard in this film and don't you dare kill him like they did Han-solo in Star Wars and they better not kill Luke SKywalker or there are going to be protest! Finally I hope he will get to be in other sci-fi films like ALiens or or the next Terminator or even the next Avatar. I would also love to see him in Part 3 of Sherlock Holmes with Robert Downey Jr. this next movie should return to the Genius Sherlock we saw in part one and really make these three (with Jude Law and Chris) really go all the way for the final film, while being faithful to the novels.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

This is exactly what the franchise needed to pick itself back up. This film is exciting and overall...it is funny. The main thing to know right in the beginning is that this film is a comedy, where the jokes surprisingly land on numerous occasions. However, this film does have trouble finding its balance. That is not to say the film is bad, it is actually quite good (notice how I gave it an 7 out of 10 rating), but this film gets lost in the comedy aspect and barely touches on the dramatic aspect that should be touched on, and it was a little disappointing.

","Marvel yet again has pulled off another fantastic movie as Thor: Ragnarok is full of action, strong acting, a clever script, and yes comedy. We finally find out what happened to Hulk after The Avengers: Age of Ultron. With the directing of Taika Waititi joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he pull's off a minor cameo of Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Steven Strange, connecting it to the post credit scene in last year's Doctor Strange. The special effect's are excellent as the effect's were done right not rushed. Jeff Goldblum also joins the MCU as the Grandmaster the leader of the planet Thor get's sent to where he battles The Hulk. Jeff Goldblum's performance was solid, as he was seen as funny and idiotic. Stan Lee makes a minor cameo as he always does in Marvel movies, but this one made me laugh for a while. This Thor might have been the best of the Thor movies, as Thor's full power's are shown. The movie show's how he doesn't need the hammer, but without it he show's he deserves the title The God Of Thunder. Loki's up to no good as usual you think you can trust him but there he goes causing trouble and making you think he finally changed for the better but he's still The God Of Mischief, but this time Loki doesn't think about the consequences of his idiotic action's as Thor can see through his trouble. Thinking deep inside Loki's a good person. The movie doesn't get boring as it will entertain the viewer who's watching it. Marvel movie's take a lot of time, effort, and planning. Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle, and Christopher Yost who were the producers of the movie wasted no time making this movie what it is. Chris Hemsworth is a perfect Thor as he's built like Thor, his acting will cement him as Thor forever as he makes you feel like Marvel cast the right man for the job back in 2010. Cate Blanchett's Hela/ Goddess of Death will give you goosebumps, she's the ultimate villain for Thor to face matching his strength. She beats Thor at the beginning take control of Asgard, and about to launch chaos/war in Asgard. But Thor takes her down, with the help of Surtur who was created from CGI, Hulk, and Valkyrie who was once part of an army of women who protected Asgard but becomes a booze-addled buffoon who remember's who she is and fight's next to Thor. Tessa Thompson did a great job as Valkyrie by acting like she was the character convincing the audience she took the effort to learn the character's history comic book history. The story sync's together as it doesn't leave any controversies after watching the film. Creating the soundtrack to make you feel like it also add's to the story and the mood of the scene. Thor: Ragnarok will always be remembered as the movie where you see Thor's full potential and the long awaited battle between The Hulk and Thor and Thor becoming the King of Asgard and the 80's music is good as it oddly fits.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

","Thor Ragnarok is a comedy disguised as a superhero film, in the same way that the Guardians of the Galaxy films are superhero films disguised as sci-fi comedies. This worried me going into the film; would this movie be too light to stand alongside other entries in the MCU? Overall however, Ragnarok was brilliant, thanks in no small part to the visually stunning direction, engaging cast and irreverent humour. Taika Waititi has enormous fun directing, and steals scenes as the hilarious Korg, with his offbeat humour and comedic style being key elements of the film which consistently had me laughing throughout. Chris Hemsworth is on fine form, and the new and unique take on a Thor film allows Hemsworth to create a far more likable God of Thunder. Alongside Thor, Tom Hiddlestone turns out another stellar performance as Loki, Mark Ruffalo excellently handles both personas of the Hulk, and Tessa Thompson portrays new character Valkyrie, who is very impressive in the film. Jeff Goldblum's Grandmaster is a highlight of proceedings; let if not be said that nobody does a better Jeff Goldblum. If there is a weak link in the cast, then it's Cate Blanchett's Hela, who I personally didn't find compelling as an antagonist. In concerns to plot, Ragnarok isn't story heavy, however this allows a platform for more gags, which is what the film really nails, so thin plot isn't a major issue. I do however feel that Ragnarok could have done with more emotional scenes; because of the relentless humour and action sequences, Ragnarok lacks the same heart as Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 for example. The spectacle in this film is immense, and the special effects solid; these components combined with Waititi's unique deadpan quirkiness add to what is a genuinely entertaining spectacle well worth a cinema visit to see.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

Boy did I get pleasantly surprised. Somehow it was a blessing that they have created a light and airy atmosphere to tell the story. Keeps Thor fresh and interesting.
I ended the movie with a good feeling and a yearning for more which is why I'm writing this review.

1612,30 October 2017,pkoh-14249,5," Guardians of the Galaxy but with much less interesting characters and storyline
","Much anticipated and hyped Marvel entry this year is undoubtedly Thor:Ragnarok. There are # of rave professional reviews out there already on this movie. I saw it this week, the first day it opened in Korea, and I am absolutely puzzled what the rave reviews were all about. Yeh, it is lighter in tone, yeah, it has more humor, and yeah there a lot more special effects, but nah, sum of all gives us a very familiar movie, some scenes very similar to this year's superhero mega hit, Wonder Woman, and some scenes even more similar to Thor's soon to be avenging teammates, Guardians of the Galaxy. You can tell that Taika Waititi who directed this movie, wanted this one to be something very different and new from the previous two Thor entries, a Thor movie that can standalone, but what we get is a very differently toned Thor entry that is not new or fresh, but rather remindful of Guadians of the Galaxy. In my view, this is a wrong turn of direction for Marvel. First, you don't have Chris Pratt or talking raccoon, nor the cute, adorable treelike humanoid, Groot. You have Chris Hemsoworth who can be funny at times but does anyone remember any of the movies he starred in, aside from MCU? So, this time, it was talking Hulk that played the worthwhile sidekick role, and believe me, Hulk was funnier and more interesting to watch. He saves the movie. Thor-Ragnarok also goes retro in it's soundtrack, but also this is far less interesting, auditory experience, compared to Guardians of the Galaxy. What they share in close similarity is that the whole story mostly takes place outer-space and this is where fatigue comes to play. We like our superheros because we can relate with them, and they team up and help weak, normal human beings in saving the world, while we watch with awe at their awesome superpower. Mostly this happens here at Earth. That is when it is most fun. Outerspace is already covered by the Guardians team and we don't really need to add more. Also, their superpower status gets bit cloudy and can get less interesting, since our creative human minds will always think and may assume that some big, wonderful creatures, monsters, villains, may just well be hiding deep in unknown space, waiting for their chances to crawl out with their undeniable power. The movies's most efforts are poured into showing good vs. evil fight scenes in dark, outer-space, by the means of visual effects. Story is very simple, something kids may like, but adults may find this movie boring and puzzling by the time end credit rolls up. Hela, the goddess of death, is the main villain here, but even with her awesome, evil power, power that is great enough to destroy Mulnir and to hold back her better known siblings, meets a quick death by another evil power who was somewhat easily handled by Hela's less powerful sibling at the beginning of this movie. Hmmm...Asgard is completely destroyed so, we won't see anymore of Asgard's spectacular, golden, futuristic sculptures, and buildings. We won't see Odin either. We may see Asgardians on Earth someday in some MCU entries. Don't know how that will all play out, but my curiosity is not peaking. Ah, I forgot to mention about the grand master, played about Jeff Goldblum. He wasn't all that funny nor did I feel he played the role all that well, but many reviewers seem to think otherwise. The character felt very annoying and forgettable. Because this one was so keen and focused on just being different, the story leaves out most of previous characters, characters interesting, and important enough, from the last two Thor entries. These efforts to be different and wildly light and humorous while having very little story to back it all up, may work this time around. The movie has a plenty of explosions, spaceships, interesting weapons of destruction, etc. but what next ? By being a standalone movie, Waititi has left Thor alone, lost far out in the space, very well disconnected. This will be a costly misstep for MCU to recover from. They will recover this time, but a couple more of these misteps, and MCU will be competing much harder than now, with DC counterpart.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

","Gosh, I hate that stupid shiny pipe organ. Anyhow, the comedy is the best part of this film. It l is the funniest Marvel film. Lots of great gags if you ask me. The other thing I thought they did pretty well was the Hulk. A lot more Hulk than we have ever seen in a long time. The story, however, is very lacking. I would have cut out the whole part on earth. The Doctor Strange cameo was super tacked on and unasked for. Didn't need that and what they do with Odin makes no sense. The third act is a CGI crap fest and very dumb. Screw Asgard! This movie as also another great example of Marvel completely wasting Idris Elda's time. I thought the second act of the film on the garbage Jeff Goldblum planet was the best. It was a lot more like Guardians of the Galaxy and it kinda worked. The problem is when they left and went back to the very Thorish land of Asgard that it lost my interest again. The characters are lacking for the most part. Cate Blanchett hasn't been this bad since Crystal Skull and her character has about as much depth as a piece of tinfoil. She enjoys walking around giving unwanted Asgardian history lessons and throwing spikes at people. Joining her is Karl Urban's character, who is the most uninspired evil sidekick since the other two coyotes from The Lion King (Whoopi was great). His ark is legitimately more predictable than the earth's rotation. We get a new hero in Tessa Thompson who's I thought was called Valkyrie until they said that she was a Valkyrie so I looked at the credits and it said her name is Valkyrie so I am really confused. Anyway, her ark goes from unhelpful, self-centered slave trader to heroically saving everybody for no reason. Returning in a desperate effort to be relevant is Thor's forgettable Asgard squad – minus the lady one. No idea where she is. Anyway, they die in like fifteen seconds, which is probably the same amount of time they took to write them in the first place. Last but not least is Jeff Goldblum as Jeff Goldblum so no complaints there. In the end, I really just wish that Taika Waititi had written this film as well as directed it. Taika Waititi's last three films are hilarious, have great characters and have emotionally relevant stories. This movie lacks a lot of what makes Taika Waititi's films so great.

In the previous movies Chris Hemsworth stays true to the character and portrays the serious Demi-God with just enough humility to make you believe in Gods. Then I'm Ragnarok he's now a comedian? This is just such a sharp change to the character that it almost doesn't feel canon - whilst Hemsworth is again superb his two performances of Thor are so different from his last appearance in AoU.

","Thor Ragnarok is the perfect blend of comedy, action, development and surprise. The only way I can describe this film is by starting at the beginning, with my favourite marvel fight scene to date which blends perfect filmography and cinematography with outstanding fight choreography and graphics. Watching Thor's hammer's perspective in a fight scene whilst he is battling it out with his sheer brute strength is amazing and proves that the hammer and himself are a team not just an weapon and a hero. The loss of Thor's trademark items like his hair, Kingdom, hammer and eye is necessary to make a surprising and incredible ending to the film. The music in this fight scenes is nothing short of inspiring and impactful whilst leaving a smile on your face at the end. My favourite part about this fight scene is the fact that you secretly know that this might be the last fight scene we have with mjolnir in the marvel cinematic universe and knowing that is 100% amazing. As you can see there are very few things about this film that I don't like but there were a few things I wasn't too fond of, like perhaps the overuse of rushed scenes, the only scene I have in mind here is (SPOILER AHEAD) Anthony Hopkins's (Odin) deaths scene as there wasn't as much emotional impact is should have had and it rushed the explanation and introduction of the supremely powerful main antagonist, Hela. However aside from that one scene I loved everyone's portrayal of their character, especially Jeff Goldblum's portrayal of the grand-master as a secondary villain and Chris Hemsworth's best portrayal of Thor to date. To some up this movie I shall reuse my summary BY FAR One of the best marvel films to date.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

Otherwise, they'll likely walk away befuddled by not only the impossible feats but also the gross inconsistencies they'd just witnessed. In the same vein, and a perhaps a bit more difficult to establish, comic book fans need to suspend their understanding of comic book lore if they truly intend to appreciate the films for what they are. The comic book film genre covers characters that exist in all comic book eras from the golden age to the current. The story lines have vastly changed as have the characters. There are even factions of fans within the comic book realm that disavow certain eras. The films extract story lines and character relationships from all of these eras, but they do not duplicate, nor in many cases, even adapt these elements.

She also plays an important part to Thor's story. Loki became more more of an anti-hero in this movie, which serves him justice. The Grandmaster is a pretty intriguing character and Sakaar is such an interesting place. I want to see a project about Sakaar and the Grandmaster.

","Thor Ragnorak is about Thor, played by Chris Hemsworth, was defeated by Hela, played by Cate Blancette, and lost his hammer. He is imprisoned by Grandmaster, played by Jeff Goldblum, as gladiator and he must fight Hulk to gain his freedom. As of now I have seen this movie twice and I have made up my mind about this movie: it is fine. I felt like I had a great time with it and it has a lot of potential to become a memorable MCU movie for me like the Guardians, winter soldier and the Avengers. The humor was great, probably the best out of all MCU movies. I loved the 80s electro soundtrack. Reminded a lot of music from Kung-fury. It also reminds me a lot of Deadpool, in fact, I felt this film almost become a PG version of deadpool at one point. I loved Jeff Goldblum, I loved his mannerism and the best actor in the film. Everything he does brings joy to me. I really like Tessa Thomason and I felt like she is a great addition to MCU cast and I hope to see more of her in the future. Mark Rufflo was amazing as hulk plus Bruce Banner. This is a more comedic Hulk we used to know from the cartoon and they did have a lot of jokes about Hulk in the past MCU movies, such as the relationship between him and Black Widow. Bottom line, all acting are great and every scene took place in Sakkar, the Hulk planet, were perfect. Notice I said scenes in Sakkar are great? Because the stories is Asgard is very generic. And that is one of the down points. The film sometimes felt like two different movies pasted together, when it took place in Sakkar it felt like a great comedy, but in Asgard it felt like generic and almost boring MCU drama. Without giving anything away, the outline of story is very similar to the first Thor movie. Hela was OK but forgettable like most MCU villains. Some the effects remind me more of a blizzard production rather than a big budget movie. At times I felt like watching a cut scene from Warcraft. Overall, I liked it. Had the film took place in Sakkar the whole time, I would even say that it is a top tier Marvel film. The serious moments really don't work well and it felt like a sore thumb compared to the amazing comedy. If you haven't seen it. Go check it out, you will have a great time.

","It's really sickening the re-writing of cultural myths such as the Norse gods to fit this stupid PC agenda and narrative is unbearably moronic. Hela is, in the actual Norse legends, the goddess of the underworld/hell NOT the goddess of death. Why is there this completely imbecilic idea to just ignore the actual Norse myths and rewrite it to fit some personal identity fem-autistic ideology PC crap when there is an actual character to base it on? In the underworld she is almost unbeatable but outside of it she is a bit on the weak side. That Hela is remade into a fem-autistic character that's is grossly and erroneously overly powered and completely different from the actual legends is just another pathetic and quite annoying act of Hollywood making up a pile of crap so they can pat themselves on the back. She was only strong when she drew her power from the realm of the underworld. This politically correct fem-autistic BS is ruining so much that would have been so good except for the inclusion of the moronic fem-autistic ideology. She breaks Thor's hammer Mjolinir? Really? Geez this is just another fem-autistic crap dance that their PC BS is imposing. Thor's hammer was forged from the core of a neutron star the strongest and hardest substance in the universe which is not possible to break. Odin couldn't have done it and Hela can? Yeah, right. Another thing Hela is NOT Odin's daughter but in fact from the actual myths she's Loki's daughter. Then there's the error of what Ragnarok is. It's not the end of Asgard it's the end of EVERYTHING. Armageddon. The gods and all people, animals, plants ALL life. All planets and stars will be consumed by Fenrir, the monster wolf, after he defeats Odin and kills him. With such a rich story already written why the hell was there a need to substitute with such a load fem-auti$tic PC crap and bullshit that contradicts it in every way. Another thing... Valkyrie is not a name it's the designation for the maiden guardians of Valhalla that rode winged horses who guided the honored dead to it's gates.

Besides all of this, starting ragnarok shlould've destroyed Earth, known as Midgard in the mythology.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

She didn't have any real weakness, depth, or purpose for her actions besides revenge and greed. Smart to change Thor's style a bit comedic wise and make him more box office friendly.

","Thor: Ragnarok came out of its corner swinging. The techno color vibes and nostalgic rock n' roll music gave it the tone and visuals it needed. Some would say that the rock n' roll is getting over done in movies but I felt that it was very fitting. Look at the other Thor movies, of all the marvel IPs Thor and Guardians of the Galaxy are probably the most far-fetched or other worldly. The music kind of makes them seem familiar in away, instead of strange and completely ""out of this world"". Maybe this coupled with the more laid back feel of the movie let it succeed where the other Thor movies didn't. Jeff Goldblum really shines in this movie with his eccentric personality as the Grandmaster. Chris Hemsworth is still getting it right every time he plays Thor, albeit the hair cut really does look a lot better. I don't know about anyone else but I defiantly could have used more Korg.

It focuses on fight scenes and jokes rather the building up a foundation. All we came to know was Hela is evil and Thor is good! So, the must fight on Asgard for Asgard! We also get a discount version of Planet Hulk because Thor vs Hulk is good for advertising! All we came to know is that Valkyrie was a Valkyrie (a discount and cheap version of Amazonian's)! The story never focused on the plot rather then jokes, more jokes and more unnecessary jokes every 5 minutes. A serious moment, let's add a joke! I love Taika Watiti, but this is not the Thor the fans need, this is marketed for 5 year old children who want Hulk and Thor smash and their parents who want to laugh.

","Thor Ragnarok was overall a good movie. It had better visuals and soundtrack then most Marvel movies normally do. However, I personally think that Marvel movies are focusing too much on comedy, which works for Spider-man and Guardians Of The Galaxy but not really with the others. Don't get me wrong, a few jokes here and there are good and all the jokes in this movie where actually really funny. My main issue with the comedy is how it trivialised the whole threat of the movies and made most of the characters look like complete buffoons. As I said it works in Spider-man and GOTG because the characters have always been like that, its what makes them stand out from the crowd. Anyway, putting the comedy aside. The characters as always where awesome, I think that this film showed the best version of hulk ever, the dynamic between Thor and Loki worked and the grand master was just fantastic. As I said the soundtrack had a massive improvement, not quite at John Williams or Hans Zimmer level yet, but baby steps, at least they didn't over use it like Dark World did. The cinematography was well handled and the effects looked nice. Overall it gets a 7/10 from me, which is still a recommendation.

Lots of jokes and laughter in the theatre, the audience were all laughing. A middle aged man sat next to me with his little son, the father laghted even harder than his son did. 
It's the third standalone movie of Thor and we can see a totally different Thor. He grew up and was much more mature than he was in the previous Thor movies. Honestly, all Thor has been through can be regarded a tragedy, even there are lots of jokes. Thor he lost his father, hammer, an eye and homeland. He save the gods from the prophesy of Ragnarok, but they met Thanos in the end of the movie, which was really worrisome. Now we can tell from the trailer of Avengers: Infinity war, it's not a happy ending. 
Jokes are good and people love jokes. 
In this movie, Loki is with his brother and all the asgardians. Finally, he is not jealous of his brother ascending to the throne. Because Thor is worthy.

","If you have anything against the iconic super hero, Thor Son of Oden, or have the notion that he is ""the weaker link"" in the Marvel Cinematic universe, you may want to reconsider when deciding to go see Thor: Ragnarok or not. This addition to the marvel movie collection is a refreshing addition to Thor's storyline, and instantly combats the claim that Thor is a ""boring superhero"". Thor: Ragnarok is a step in the right direction if you're wanting to watch an entertaining and comedic driven approach to super hero movies. The movie starts with Thor's father, Oden, dying in his presence. Because of his death the evil goddess of death, Hella, invades their home world. Unexpectedly Thor's hammer is obliterated by her and he is thrown into another world. While in this foreign world Thor makes allies in order to escape and return to his home world to save his civilization. What I liked most about this movie is that in the most epic fight scenes they never failed to include a classic rock song to really pump up the adrenaline. Along with great music, the visual effects are outstanding and really convince you that this world from another universe is real. There cannot be enough emphasis on the comedy in this movie, it is a step above the Guardians of the Galaxy type humor and it really changes the mood of Thor for the better. However, one flaw I did find in the movie was major plot line, the start, middle and end was like every other superhero movie; this movie distinguished itself by changing up how they got from each phase in the plot. In recent memory the character Thor has been heavily criticized but in this edition the director gets it right and makes him more relatable, funny and just the right amount of cockiness to spice things up.

However, that's on sheer entertainment because as I read some things on this film I realized the sheer dept and fan service they pay to true comic fans. I was always a DC Comics kid so I miss a lot of the Easter eggs but Marvel fans must be over the moon. The film also is much more comedic than others in the Universe, above and beyond what would normally be there and honestly (especially in the beginning) it felt a little forced.

Ragnarok never takes itself too seriously, and it works, because I haven't laughed this hard watching a super hero movie, in a very long time.

","It more like a comedy film but there are some touchy scene in the film related to Odin the father Character. the hulk flew across a the universe by the Quin jet and by the way no one said that in avengers that could fly in to space. Otherwise the Climax Action is a major effect job and all the characters such as Thor, Hela, Loki, Valkyrie, hulk, Grand master, hamdele they all did a great job and a great performance.

","The film is good. All the character are balanced except for Hella. I think there could be more to her. She looks plain and her charaterisation lacks appeal, at least for me .
The Hulk part was on another level. I found it fitting , funny not overdone and more verbal than previous installments.

It's definitely better than the previous Thor movies and Hulk makes the movie just better. If you like both comedy and action then this movie is for you. I gave the movie 8/10 but only because there was a bit too much comedy for my taste and I would like to see more of the Hulk smashing stuff.

","So the film was good, it has lot of humor in it, i wouldn't be angry if it had a little more drama, however when it has to be dramatic it is so i am okay with that, and i would say that basically its one of the best marvel films. I was surprised that final fight was between two villains and I was Also surprised how Dr. Strange was just doing what he wanted with two GODS, they were like his puppets. I am also happy that Thor is buffed, because before without his hammer he was weak as ...well you know..., and now finally he is The REAL GOD, but there is one thing that i have to say and that is that the actor who plays Grandmaster plays him so super good and that post-credit scene, how he played them he's just the best. Hela as the villain was really good, however i was surprised that her only abilities were to create swords and throwing them(it was weird but not mainstream, and also she can create like a lot of them and very big if she want and throwing them super fast) and also super-strength. And the last thing... I am happy that Thor had really big progress in this movie alongside with Hulk.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017

","When I saw the first trailer of Thor Ragnarok , I told myself : Oh Boy... It's gonna be The Top 10 of 2017.
I was extremely excited to watch this movie.
But now after watching it , I'm kinda despondence. I expect something more than that. Actually I think the new series of Avengers destroyed my hunger. For me Thor Ragnarok was like a bridge that try to bring Avengers Heroes together. It was like watching Guardians of The Galaxy with this difference that In the Guardians we see gun battles but in Thor Fist and sword battles. I mean if somebody entered to my room and Watched TV , He was gonna say : Is That a new Guardians Of The Galaxy!!?
I think only thing that Persuading me to watch Ragnarok for the second time is its comedy and humor. should consider that it supposed to be a SuperHero Movie not a comedy. 
I don't know why I have a bad feel about Ragnarok! in fact it wasn't that much bad but it didn't answer my expectations. In my deep heart I'd love Ragnarok but I prefer to watch ""The Dark world"". Taika Direct this movie on it's best way but The Story should've been something more powerful than this. 
I hope It don't happen to Infinity war. People Come this far to see something extremely perfect.

","Thor is my favorite MCU series. After that, Frigga is my favorite MCU character, and fortunately she was the only one spared recasting by the Ragnarok comedy hour. 
Something special happens when a heroic story line is infused with comedic tones. That's not so easily said when the opposite happens. The previous Thor films were meaningful, moving even. On the other hand, Thor: Ragnarok was an avalanche of slapstick and standup-not a minute's rest. The hodgepodge of plots and backstories was unsatisfying, but when you realize that Hulk has more lines than Heimdall, you begin to understand what's missing. The part about Odin, Allfather, as earthly dementia victim didn't make sense either. On the bright side, it was nice to see Thor's powers expand after the loss of Mjolnir. In the next Thor, I hope a more serious, more powerful (and fully-sighted) King rises out of the ashes of Asgard.",/review/rw4234739/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_Ragnarok_2017
