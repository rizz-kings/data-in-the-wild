","Is this a huge stepup from the original ""Thor"" movie. No, unfortunately not. Is it another watchable, fun superhero movie; yes, definitely. It's a really good movie and if we look at the way Alan Taylor directs this movie, it's actually not that much different from what Branagh did back in 2011. Chris Hemsworth is good as usual and Tom Hiddleston is more wonderful than ever as Loki, but the villain Malekith, played by Christopher Eccleston, unfortunately, is a bit of a disappointment, mostly because of the lack of motivation.",/review/rw2972870/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_The_Dark_World_2013
1,8 December 2013,DarthVoorhees,2," Completely on autopilot...
",Let me start by saying that I don't hate superhero films. I like them very much when they are done well. I hate laziness in films and superficiality. The problem is that pretty much every superhero film made is very lazy and most of them are entirely superficial. Marvel's initial idea of an Avengers universe was inspired from a marketing stand point but I am beginning to question whether or not it has been a failure from a creative stand point. 'Thor the Dark World' is a terrible movie. It does absolutely nothing to add to the mythos of the character or this Marvel universe. The only reason it exists is to draw up excitement for the next Avengers film. ,/review/rw2972870/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_The_Dark_World_2013

","Thor: The Dark World left me wondering why for all its popularity and box office hype the superhero genre so regularly fails to ignite the faintest trace of excitement and imagination in its narrative and storytelling. This sequel, following Kenneth Branagh's reasonably funny 2011 film, was written by no less than five writers, who between them have only mustered another dull, achingly generic story about saving the world. Aside from less than a handful of funny self-referencing points, this is a hugely disappointing by the numbers blockbuster that under services its embarrassingly rich cast and offers its enormous fanbase too little that is challenging, inspired or even surprising.

","I guess it may be the fact that I never actually got into comic books (beyond Asterix and Tintin that is) that this movie didn't really appeal to me. I guess in another way that I did not find that mixing the gods of the Norse pantheon with the world of superheroes really worked all that well. To me it just seemed to be wrong. Okay, I understand that Thor is the member of the Avengers, and the comic series that bears his name is quite popular, but to me parts of this film did not seem to work.

5,6 December 2013,A_Different_Drummer,2," Yep, they got the ""dark"" part right..
","Well they got the ""dark"" part right. Does it distress anyone at all that somewhere deep in the bowels of Hollywood there are people who make many times what you make for coming up with the idea that watching a lot of banging and clanging in an alternate universe that -- at its best -- resembles Central Park at midnight is .... entertainment? If it does not, it should. The problem with sequels like this -- aside from the fact that they are actually produced in the first place -- is that they serve no useful purpose other than making the original in the franchise look better than it was. I promise you, IN THE NAME OF ODIN AND ALL THE 9 WORLDS, that half way through this exercise in controlled depression, you will long for Thor 1. (With its really clever opening -- essentially the story of a Boy and his Hammer, having been separated therefrom, and finally reunited). Tom Hiddleston steals all his scenes, in some places he is more interesting huddled in a corner reading a book than all the CGI flashbangs and associated pyrotechnics combined. Sir Anthony -- a man seemingly untroubled by how poorly this phase of his career pales in comparison to his prior work -- is lost behind his eyepatch and almost unrecognizable. Portman has never had better H&M (hair and makeup) and in the chatgroups there are fanboys prattling on about watching this with the sound off. A final factoid: In the 60s, in the days when Marvel was only comics, Thor was never top gun, it was the artwork (flaming yellow hair) and the pleasant predictability of the stories and the arcane language that carried the brand. So far, Marvel has yet to really translate this into film.",/review/rw2972870/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_The_Dark_World_2013

","This is a very unpolished sequel that seems to have gotten made, because they wanted a sequel and more money for the studio (probably more about the money). I liked this less than the previous first installment and I am not even a fan of the first one. It has more action and special effects, but that doesn't make a superhero movie any better. It just wasn't interesting nor did it have anything for me to attach myself to. After few minutes in, I just wanted for the final action set pieces to come in (which is actually cleverly done) and be done with. I know humor isn't suppose to be the part that stands out in a superhero movie, but my goodness, the humor in this is just forced and awful. Some of the characters seem more annoying than beneficial to this movie as a whole and just seemed to be there, because they were in the previous movie in this franchise. This movie brings nothing new to the superhero genre, they had the mentality of ""if it works previously, why fix it?"" direction. It's like one of those video games that does well with the first installment, but does the same thing with the gameplay and everything for the next installment with a different story with just another different villain that is generic as it gets.",/review/rw2972870/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_The_Dark_World_2013

23,6 December 2013,dwpollar,5," Technically superb Thor sequel that is missing a heart...
","1st watched 12/4/2013 – 5 out of 10(Dir-Alan Taylor): Technically superb Thor sequel that is missing a heart or a reason to care. Visually this movie has a lot to offer, but about halfway thru a realization comes that the fluff isn't enough to sustain a seasoned movie-goer. I had a similar reaction to the Harrison Ford epic ""Blade Runner"" and other movies that have a lot of style, but very little heart. The story revolves around a matter hidden deep beneath the Earth called ""Ether"" that can change compositions quickly and is sought after by an evil elf-like creature from a world before there was light, Aka. The Dark World. He believes this Ether has the power to bring back his world. Natalie Portman, plays Jane Foster, a companion of Thor and a scientist – who comes upon this substance during an investigation and it possesses her. The evil creature is then after her and Thor(played by Chris Hemsworth), and he, of course, wants to protect her. The settings in the movie consist of Asgard – ruled by Thor's father Odin(played by Anthony Hopkins), London, and the dark elves' world.the movie jumps back and forth between these worlds partially because of a weird warp found during the investigation that transfers items across these worldsbut Thor seems to be able to go in and out no matter what. There is plenty of action to be had, decent acting, and a little humor but other than the expected battle between good vs. evil there is no real reason or emotion to stay with the movie to the very end. The movie should probably win some visual effects awards, but I'm looking for a complete experience and in my opinion – this isn't one. It is a good try but not quite good enough for my approval.",/review/rw2972870/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_The_Dark_World_2013

","Thor was a big gamble for Marvel in 2011. One of the campier Avengers who was surrounded by full-blown fantasy elements, the Norse God with a big red cape and hammer wasn't even being played by a well known star. What a difference two years and a box office behemoth in the form of The Avengers makes. This sequel comes with virtually no risk and a lead actor who is now a bona fide A-lister, but it also comes with much higher hopes. Swapping Kenneth Branagh's Shakespearian influence for Alan Taylor's Game of Thrones experience, The Dark World has decreased it's regality and amped up it's grittiness, yet thankfully retains its sense of fun. There's definitely a feel of greater peril here, with no-one but Thor seemingly out of Taylor's reach for a fatal ending, however for every scene of despair or Dark Elven malevolence, there's a hilarious gag (Loki's shapeshifting and any time Stellan Skarsgard's nutty scientist is on screen are highlights) waiting around the corner. The action set-pieces don't disappoint either; the climactic battle is inventive, if not mind-blowing, and a couple of earlier melees - including an attack on Asgard - are exhilarating and keep the pace moving swiftly along. What elevates this follow up though is the pairing of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who, after two previous movies to build up their brotherly baggage and perfect their repartee, are scintillating whether in the process of a daring escape or just engaging in some general chit chat.

45,16 November 2013,gorangogo,2," This movie is absolute garbage.
","Let me start off by saying I had fairly high expectations for this film, not only being a fan of the first film but of Thor as a comic book characters. To be nice, these expectations were not met. To be realistic, this is easily the worst of the Marvel movies. This is my first review so sorry if I jump around a lot with what I say. Let's begin with the characters. Thor was.. okay. He said nor did anything noteworthy really. He didn't grow that much as a character, and simply felt boring. Natalie Portman was horribly boring to watch, and in some scenes her character was written as an idiot. That seems to be a common problem with the movie. Jane Foster? An idiot. Eric Selvig, an originally intelligent character that had some serious, good talks with Thor? Running around naked because the Tesseract made him go insane... or something. It wasn't very clear. Speaking of, if he went insane because of the Tesseract, why was Hawkeye completely okay after a bonk on the head? Darcy? The most annoying girl on the planet. She was meant for comedy but came of as GRATING to listen to and watch. Odin was a douche who didn't know how to rule properly. Malekith was just... boring. The makers had so much to work with, considering in the comics what a clever sorcerer he is, as well as a deranged homicidal madman. In this movie his motivations are unclear and his only character trait was he likes to frown at things with his puffy looking face. Character wise the only saving graces were Idris Elba as Heimdall and Tom Hiddleston as Loki, which did not matter much considering how little they were in the movie. Which is strange because Loki is in the trailer so much, but has MAYBE 20 minutes of screen time. The special effects in this movie were just ugly. Every monster looked fake and many of the scenes looked like they were pulled out of a last gen video game. the set design was okay, but not once did I feel immersed. Everything felt like a flimsy set. It was just an ugly movie to look at. The plot was just all over the place, with cuts to different scenes happening frequently. Many scenes were completely useless could have been cut altogether. Literally the only good scene was when Loki and Thor trick Malekith. Also, considering it was never explained how Loki was able to survive a stab wound, switch places with a guard, then switch places with Odin becoming the new leader of Asgard, the ending makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. The dialogue was just... horrendous. There were multiple points where myself and the people I've seen the movie with just laughed at the ridiculousness of what was being said. Speaking of, the movie was farrrrrr too funny. Don't get me wrong, I like comedic relief in these Marvel movies, it works for the established universe but GOD they literally play every scene for comedy it seems. Even the final world ending battle with Malekith was played for comedy. For Christ's sake, THOR RODE TO THE BATTLE IN A SUBWAY CAR. There's a gag where him and Malekith are sliding on the side of a building with office people looking outside blankly, completely meant for comedy.. IN THE FINAL, WORLD ENDING BATTLE. Avengers, Thor, Iron Man 1,2 Captain America, all these movies had the common sense to put the comedy in scenes where it was necessary. Hell, even Iron Man 3, the most comedic movie behind this one had the common sense to say ""This is the final battle. Let's make this badass"". Another problem with the final battle itself is that it has no 'WOW' moments. There's no real climax, everything is just bleh. OH and Malekith is squished by his spaceship. That's something. Oh and why the hell do Asgardians and Dark Elves have so many technological based things?! They have star ships, turrets, laser cannons, ray guns, etc. There's nothing here that feels like magic, which is what Thor should be about. And the Aether. The main point of the movie. The weapon to spread darkness throughout the universe essentially ushering an era of rule under Malekith. I couldn't tell you a damn thing about this thing other that it spread... darkness. whatever that means. The concepts that this movie is trying to give are incredibly under explained. Where did the Aether come from? Not explained. How did Jane end up actually finding it? Not sure. What's the Convergence? It's when the 9 realms line up so Malekith can... spread... darkness?.. How powerful is it? I have no idea. Apparently universe shattering, but Thor doesn't have much trouble fighting an Aether powered Malekith. It's actually kind of sad how easily he was dispatched. There is little fun to be had in this movie. It's just stupid. I didn't care about a single character besides Loki, who was actually somewhat developed and easily stole the show when he was on screen. This movie is absolute garbage and has ruined Thor cinematically for me. I truly hope Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy are good or I truly worry for the Avenegers 2.

","Darcy! Jane! Selvig! Mew Mew! The gang's all back. For me, Thor was one of the best superhero movies to come out in recent time. I far preferred it to the overrated Iron Man films, and like Thor with coffee...I wanted another! While it's not as good as the first one, it's still quite enjoyable and far from the 'worst' like some make it out to be. Chris Hemsworth, despite having the less 'flashy' role next to Tom Hiddleston's Loki, is really very good. What made Thor so likable in the first film was that, despite his overconfidence and head-strong nature, he went on a character's journey that changed him (Hemsworth's charm helped) and had lots of great little moments. Then he got royally screwed in The Avengers and was made a mockery of, which did a major disservice to him. This time around, he's back to strutting his stuff and doing what he does best: wielding his mighty hammer like nobody else can.

","This is in no way a knock on the first Thor because I enjoyed it a lot, but, as said with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Thor: The Dark World impressed me more. The look of the film is wonderful, Asgard is just as colourful as it was in Thor yet also darker too, matching the darker, bolder tone very well. The photography and editing are stylish and the locations, especially Iceland, are stunningly vivid. The special effects are even more dazzling than in Thor and the same can be said for the stunts. The music score by Brian Taylor is dynamic and never repetitive or pedestrian, adding to the action sequences rather than detracting. Speaking of the action sequences, they are packed with thrills with battles almost on scale of Lord of the Rings and smack-downs that are enough to crush the bones. But Thor: The Dark World is not just about action and spectacle, it has substance too(or at least it did to me), laden with humour that will genuinely make you laugh but doing so without over-powering the dark nature of the story or the tense sparring between Thor and Loki. The story is compelling with the right doses of action, humour and drama, it's bigger in scale and bolder in tone than the first Thor but also more expansive in characterisation. The acting is top-class with most of the cast getting more to do, Anthony Hopkins is always dependable and Natalie Portman brings a touch of class and Stellan Skarsgard has some very funny moments but the acting honours do go to Chris Hemsworth, who's more robust and poised than he was in the first Thor, and especially Tom Hiddleston, who is terrific as Loki and pitches his mellifluousness and serpentine-like malevolence perfectly. My only complaints here are Christopher Eccleston having very little to do so he gives a somewhat one-dimensional performance that exudes moody menace but not much else and Loki surrendering and Thor forgiving him too easily and quickly. All in all however, a truly excellent follow-up that improves even more over the first Thor. 9/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2972870/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_The_Dark_World_2013

","Once again, we have another good Marvel film that is severely underrated. ""Thor: The Dark World"" in my opinion was better that the original. It felt different in a couple ways. It had a better plot, better story, better action, and even better acting. I really enjoyed the plot about The Dark Elves trying to turn the Nine realms into eternal darkness as long ago as 5,000 years, during the alignment of the Nine realms, when Odin's father was on the throne, and then coming back 5,000 years later just before the next alignment to try again. I also liked the story of Jane being infected with the Either and needing to get it out of her, during that, we got to see Jane go to Asgard, and Thor and Loki team up to try snd escape Asgard after it went into lockdown. The action, and final battle scene were also better in this movie. As I am watching Marvel's movies latter into the franchise, I can see the action getting better, and them getting a hold on how to make a good action sequence.

","The first Thor film based on the popular Marvel comics, directed by Kenneth Branagh, was a good watch, and I was looking forward to seeing this sequel, not just because it looked really good, but it was also a continuation and crossover of the Avengers Assemble plot. Basically thousands of years ago Bor (Tony Curran), the father of Odin (Sir Anthony Hopkins), fought in the great war between the Dark Elf Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) who wants to destroy the universe with the weapon called the Aether, they are defeated, the Aether is hidden somewhere in a stone column, and while imprisoned Malekith, his lieutenant Algrim (Lost's Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and other Dark Elves escape in suspended animation. In the present day on Asgard, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is being imprisoned for his war crimes on Earth, there is a possibility that Thor (Chris Hemsworth) will take over the throne from his father Odin, meanwhile on Earth in London astrophysicist Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her former intern Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings), who herself has intern Ian Boothby (Jonathan Howard), are investigating unearthly things. In abandoned warehouse Jane, Darcy and Ian find an invisible portal that makes things disappear into thin air, sometimes coming back and going through again, sometimes not, then all of the sudden Jane is teleported to another world, and there she finds the stone containing the Aether, which infects her, and she returns to Earth unaware of what has happened. Back in Asgard a rare alignment of the Nine Realms is imminent, it also means portals to the other worlds appear at random, Thor is told by Heimdall (Idris Elba) that Jane disappeared, he goes to Earth to see she is safe, he takes her to his home world to see healers, they do not know how to treat her, Odin warns that the infection of the Aether will eventually kill her, and that its return means a prophecised catastrophe. The Aether release has awakened Malekith, and he and his group make an attack Asgard, and during the battle Thor and Loki's mother Frigga (Rene Russo) is killed, Odin orders Thor to do nothing, but against his father's wishes he releases his malevolent brother, as he knows Malekith's secret portal, they will attempt to use Jane to lure and confront him, and he makes a deal that Loki can have revenge for the death of their mother. Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Sif (Jaimie Alexander) and Fandral (Zachary Levi) assist their getaway and escape from the Asgardian soldiers, they commandeer a Dark Elf spaceship and with Jane transport to Svartalfheim, once there they eventually find Malekith, Loki tricks him into removing the Aether from inside Jane and absorb it himself, Thor fails to destroy it before it enters the enemy's body, and Loki appears mortally wounded in a short fight, before he apparently dies Thor promises his brother he will tell of his sacrifice. Thor and Jane find another portal, the same that took her from Earth to the stone, so they teleport back to Earth and reunite with Darcy, Ian and Jane's mentor Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård), who recently came out from an institution following a breakdown after the New York attacks, they work out that Melekith will attempt to destroy the universe in the centre of the Convergence, in Greenwich. The Dark Elves spaceship crashes through the city square, and Malekith and Thor battle going though the various portals, Thor's hammer going back and forth to find him, finally Malekith is transported to Svartalfheim before he can destroy the universe, the spaceship collapsing to the ground is transported too, and he is killed crushed by it, the Earth is safe. In the end Thor is asked by Odin to take his place as king of Asgard, he declines and tells of Loki's sacrifice, and when he walks away Odin turn out to be the living Loki in disguise, and in the mid- credits a villain called The Collector (Benicio Del Toro) is given the Aether by Volstagg and Sif to look after, it is obvious from his final words that he has other things to collect for an evil plot. Also starring Tadanobu Asano as Hogun, Clive Russell as Tyr, Chris O'Dowd as Richard, Chris Evans as Captain America, Talulah Riley as Nurse, Alice Krige as Eir Stan Lee as Patient. Hemsworth once again is great as the strong willed and heroic warrior, Portman is still sweet as the hero's love interest, Ecceleston is almost unrecognisable with his deep voice and makeup and makes a menacing presence, Hiddleston is still lovably malevolent and snide with his quips, and Hopkins in his time brings his usual good seriousness. The story is a little technological and bolder than the previous fantasy film, with much more being destroyed and many more battles on Earth and in outer space, so plenty of great special effects to create the spectacle, its interesting to see it going on in Great Britain in an American made film, and you feel the doom and gloom moments too, all this combines to make a much better than the first, highly entertaining and exciting action adventure film.

71,11 November 2013,ironhorse_iv,7," Can Lightning strike twice? Yes. Thor: The Dark World was as good as the original film.
","Thor: the Dark World was action pack to the point that indeed it was the God of Thunder. My ears hurts after this movie. Louds of exploding sounds. Unlike the first movie, where Thor lost his power, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) in this film is more God-like, and mature. Thor isn't learning anything new as a human being, or being taught a lesson in this movie. It just Thor trying to stop an alien invasion, yet again like 2012's Avengers. Indeed, comic book fans would like to see Thor do more Thor things and they got it. In my opinion, I like character development, and this movie lacks that. The movie plot is bit too confusing and silly for me. The aliens trying to conquer the Universe with a weapon known as Aether seem one-dimension villains who just happen to be just evil. After all they are call Dark Elves. Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) played a competent bad guy and I was really disappointed by his performance. I really wanted him to stand out more. Even with me, reading some of the Thor comic books, knowing a few Norse mythology, and watching the previous films, I did find myself, coming in lost. I can only guess, what first time people were thinking coming into the film, they must be asking themselves, what in the hell are we watching? The movie does an OK job, telling the backstory of the plot, and then to repeat it time after time just to make sure, but even with that, as a first time Thor watcher, you might find yourself confused. Unlike the original film that takes place mostly on Earth, in this film, most of scenes take place in the CGI world-building nine realms worlds of Norse mythology. The worlds is a lot better, than the first movie as I thought Asgard look so fake in the CGI due to all the shine crap. Asgard is supposed to look old, grittier and dirty like Vikings. It been there for thousands of years. Glad to see the film, wasn't in Dutch angle that much this time. In this film, it remind me of bit of Lord of the Rings, as more details are added to the mixed. After all, there was even a language created for the Dark Elves. Still, the Shakespeare dialogue got to the point, I was not only getting lost, but tune out. Hard to relate to the main characters, when nothing about them, is even relates to the real world. I found myself, trying to escape this world, but the dialogue is so bland. Yes, the film did had lot of humor. Mostly the same fish-out-of-water jokes from the first film. It was a hit or miss. They even made Thor look more like a meatball than the previous films. They did give Loki (Tom Hiddleston) most of the best lines in the film. I have to say that when Thor has to team up with Loki against his newest threat, it was some of the best scenes in the film. They had this buddy cop thing going for them. I think Marvel really did hit the gold mine with the actor because he does bring some really need charm, and humor to a really out of place world. I think the ladies in the room even like his presence. Most of the humor, came in the form of a side-character that fans of the first movie kinda didn't like which is Darcy Lewis (Kat Denning). In this movie, she is given more annoying scenes, but at less she kinda has a reason to be in the film. I'm sorry, but I'm not a huge fan of the character as her scenes feel like filler scenes that has nothing to do with the main plot. The female leads seems really weak in this film. In my opinion, I thought Thor and Loki had more screen connection, than Foster and Thor. Natalie Portman as the love-interest to Thor, Jane Foster, seem really to be phoning in her performance, here. I really doubt, Portman really gave much of herself in acting for this role. She really seem like she didn't want to act in this picture. It was no surprised that on screen, her performance was mediocre. She nearly backed out, when Director Patty Jenkins was replace by director Alan Taylor. She refused to return for the sequel but she was forced to return due to her contract. I did like the surprise secrets cameos: look out for somebody a certain American to make his brief presence, creator Stan Lee and if you stay after the credits, a certain character from the 2014's Guardians of the Galaxy movie. There was some things, I didn't like. I didn't like the awful plot recycle similar to the Avengers film with Aether sounding like the same thing as the Tesseract AKA Cosmic Cube. Without spoiling too much, look out for a lot of recycle fake out deaths like the first movie, 'Thor'. So annoying as hell. I did like the action in the film. I like the portal action scene in the end. It was pretty interesting and funny seeing Thor's beloved supercharged hammer ""Molinjor"" trying to find him. Watch it in 2D, the 3D added little of worth. Overall: The movie is a little far fetch even for a comic book movie as Thor has always been a hard character to get people into liking him, but it works here to a point. At least, if they cut like 30 minutes of the film. This deeply cheesy cartoonish, extremely noisy action movie that's drowning in CGI was not the worst comic book film, in my opinion. It was a feel good fun fantasy escape movie. It work as a good filler film before the next Avengers film.",/review/rw2972870/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_The_Dark_World_2013

74,11 November 2013,Bruce722,10," Simply amazing!
","Thor: The Dark World is definitely one of the best superhero films I've ever seen. The cast, led by Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman, did a great job once again. Supporting actors Tom Hiddleston, Idris Elba, Kat Dennings, Jaimie Alexander, Anthony Hopkins, and so many more really are amazing. I've heard a lot of complaints about the pace being too quick and difficult to keep up with. My response? Don't take stupid people to see the movie. I honestly don't see how anyone would have trouble keeping up with the pace of the film. I thought the plot development was actually one of the stronger parts of the film. Another strong element was the humor. Like the first installment, there was a lot of situational humor. However, this movie took it to an entirely new level and didn't feel forced and out of place. Most of this is thanks to the aforementioned Kat Dennings and her unique comedic flair. Also, watch for the Captain America cameo for maybe the most humorous scene in the film. The action sequences were up to par with the rest of the movies, meaning they were epic. Natalie Portman is as breathtaking as ever and the rest of the supporting cast adds a combination of depth and humor. The only negative in the movie, and I'm really not sure if it's a fair one, is that I wanted more Lady Sif. I'm sorry but you have one of the most beautiful women in the world, who happens to be a fantastic actress, playing one of the most badass and intriguing roles in the movie and she's barely even relevant? You've gotta do better than that. Supposedly she originally had a more prominent role even creating somewhat of a love triangle but the studio ultimately decided to trim that back, essentially eliminating a large chunk of her screen time. After some thought I decided it didn't really ""hurt"" the film so I won't let it affect the rating but I would've liked liked to see her more. Hopefully we'll get that in the special features when it releases on blu-ray. Overall, I'd say this is probably the third best Avengers film yet, behind Iron Man and The Avengers. Hopefully they continue to deliver because they've got one helluva series going.",/review/rw2972870/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_The_Dark_World_2013

All the cast from the first movie return and the new villain is Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) a dark-elf on a mission to restore what he sees is the natural order of the universe.

I'm an old guy and my tastes run all over the place, but I was taken in from he start As I've said before, people are taking their times with these films, not throwing out some cheap sequel to get a quick buck. Once again the setup is very well done. Loki is in prison in what looks like the city zoo. He rests in squalor, waiting his turn to return to power. He is a master of misdirection and disguise, so we never know when we can trust him. The answer, of course, is never. Still, for me, he is the most engaging of all the characters. He is a perpetual thorn in the side of everyone. He is the incarnation of the true Norse character, the trickster. The plot is really interesting. Ultimately, we must get to earth because all the adventure above the ground becomes a bit distant to us mortals. The researchers, including Natalie Portman's character (who has fallen big time for Thor and he for her), continue to try to figure out a way to understand the workings of this netherworld. An array of fun characters, most carried over from the first film as well as the Avengers, parry and thrust their way. Despite the grave consequences of their actions and those of the gods, there is a great deal of tongue in cheek humor and surprising twists that make it more than a bunch of characters trying to beat each other to a pulp.

It is good to see that Marvel takes good care it's movies and combines finely different productions. That ensures nice comic feeling in their movies. Unquestionably Thor: The Dark world is Marvel's elite in these comic book adaptions. The end of the movie promises more sequels for this sledge hammer hero.

It feels like TV has another spin off cop show. The CGI is big-budget, but the story here has hardly any suspense and is boring. The movie reuses the short action, talking, villain creates problem, talking, and conclusion plot line. The movie starts with a small-scale fight with irrelevant enemies to introduce Thor. Then Jane messes with a portal while an ancient vengeful antagonist who lost long ago shows up, all the way to the mid-point when Marvel recreates the Star Wars The Phantom Menace battle with the energy shield dome and two armies run at each other, and it ends shortly, to restart in the ending. Thor has no weaknesses and he needs Loki for distraction. Describing the ending in one sentence sounds like the premise of The Avengers ending. Save your money for the next Marvel movie.

","'Thor - the dark world' has some good moments, particularly the gags and the characters of Loki and Thor himself, but most of the rest is bloated CGIsville and ham portentousness. The plot is straight out of 'Lord of the Rings.' The dark side of life portrayed by the Black Elves (very reminiscent of The Teletubbies!) are rising (originally the Universe was dark until Thor's Grandad sent them packing and brought the Light). However, the Elves' main ultimate weapon - the Aether (cue misty red smoke) - was not destroyed but buried beneath a fifties car park in East London!!!! Where's that Ring when you need it?! Thor's girlfriend (Natalie Portman - the Elves are taller than her!)discovers it and becomes a carrier - fortunately she does not suffer Gollum's fate of disfigurement. Now that would have been a plot twist! The rest of the film is the Black Elves trying to get hold of the Aether while Thor, Loki and assorted London-based Earthlings attempt to prevent them. The best bit is the relationship between Thor and Loki with some good acting from Hemsworth and Hiddlestone, but the attack on Asgard is a copy of Michael Shannon's rebellious effort on Krypton, and from then on in the plot holes get bigger and bigger. True, the destruction of Greenwich - as Thor and Chief Baddie battle it out - does not go on as long as 'Man of Steel' in New York, but is a yawnfest.

","A few complaints before I address what worked for me. While I enjoyed it, I felt it didn't have quite the ""wow"" factor the first film had. The mood throughout is somber, both in look and feel, with the occasional bit of humor (mostly from Kat Dennings). The story is more complex and I'm not of the camp that feels that is always a good thing. Once again, the cast is great although it seems the supporting characters like Sif and The Warriors Three are largely wasted. Odin is especially pompous and unbearable this time around. When you have Thor having to counsel his father on peace not war, it feels at times like this isn't even the same Odin from the first film. Obviously the sci-fi gobbledygook elements will please many. I'm referring to the Aether nonsense and everything surrounding it. It's one of those ""shut your brain off to enjoy it"" moments for me. Also, Loki's trick of using illusions or impersonating people was used way too much. It made the last time he uses it in the film less effective. The villain Malekith is uncharismatic and, frankly, dull. Finally, the look of the film wasn't my favorite. This is just a stylistic preference but I felt it was too ""Lord of the Rings"". Everything was muted colors and kind of depressing. The first film was much brighter and felt like more of a superhero movie. Stick with what has worked for you, Marvel.

","From the superb minds of Don Payne, Stan Lee and director Alan Taylor comes this next chapter in the life of the Mythical Norse God, Thor (Chris Hemsworth). We learn that Odin, (Anthony Hopkins) the King of the Viking Gods has discovered the Dark Elves have once again retrieved their Ancient power called the Aether and the Elves believed it's time to destroy Asgard with it. Thor believes his love interest Jane Forter (Natalie Portman) safeguards the power within her and it's up to him to want it destroyed before his new enemy Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) can use it to kill his father, destroy Asgard and Earth too. So with the unlikely help of his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) Thor confronts his enemies and engages in a gigantic battle. The movie is a lot easier to follow this time and all the best of CGI and the Special Effects teams do their utmost to entertain the audience with tremendous Action, adventure and magically moments.

","Continuing the second phase of Marvel's cinematic onslaught, begun several months prior with Iron Man 3, Thor's encore solo performance is a markedly stronger, more focused effort than his first. Though Earth still factors into the mix, particularly in the clever, gripping climactic fight scene, there's no mistaking that this is Asgard's story and that clear emphasis, missing from the original, makes a big difference. As a distinctly fantasy-laden epic, it also benefits from a fresh, authentic flavor that its stable-mates just can't match. There's more to see than smashed skyscrapers and flattened taxi cabs in Thor's world, and that brand of open possibility makes the realm an absolute delight to swallow up. As visual feasts go, this is at or near the top of the pile - it's gorgeous, innovative and generally unlike anything else in modern cinema, a stuffed bagful of sensory treats. The acting, too, has taken a grand step up since our last trip across the rainbow bridge. Surprisingly, this time Natalie Portman comes across as a clunky third wheel: Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston provide the real intrigue, hammering home Thor's complicated relationship with his conniving adopted brother, Loki.

","I may be alone in this opinion but I believed Kenneth Branagh's THOR was the weakest film in the first phase of Marvel films. Yes, even weaker than IRON MAN 2. It wasn't that I hated the film but it failed to leave any sort of impression on me. Thor was always going to be one of the more difficult characters for Marvel to bring to the big screen. As opposed to characters with more ""grounded"" (in the loosest sense of the term) origins, Thor is a more mystical being. He's a demigod from another dimension who's near invulnerable to most forms of damage. So, right off the bat, he's not the easiest to relate to. So the first film went the route of a ""fish- out-of-water"" scenario as Thor loses his Asgardian powers and is banished to Earth to learn his lesson. So he spends a nice portion of the movie without actually being a superhero and we spend it on Earth. You know, that place we've spent every other Marvel movie to that point despite Marvel having a rich mythology with countless other possibilities. So, yeah, THOR was enjoyable but forgettable. But THE DARK WORLD corrects for these past weaknesses and actually brought us a Thor movie that I really enjoyed. The movie begins following the events of THE AVENGERS, with Loki condemned to the Asgardian dungeon for his crimes and Thor struggling to clean up the mess his brother's defiance had created across the Nine Realms.",/review/rw2972870/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_The_Dark_World_2013

There were also a few too many narrative conveniences, a couple involving Loki's ability to impersonate other people. Nevertheless, it was entertaining and kind of what I've come to expect from Marvel. The acting is very good, as is the action and visual effects.

","This sequel to 2011's 'Thor' exhibits the return of our titular Marvel superhero with both the good and the bad to offer for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With no surprise, expectations were high on how this film would handle the resurrection of the hammer- wielding god of thunder considering how the cinematic universe is set speak to the fanbase rather than Hollywood's general expectations. This only bring us to the question of whether it succeeds. The answers lies square in between yes and no. Kenneth Branaugh who directed the first film dropped out of the project, and the director's chair was handed over to Alan Taylor. The final outcome shows the Branaugh holds a slightly more gifted handling on the source material whereas Taylor's rendition of the titular hero leaves more to desired. By no means does this mark a disaster of a sequel but rather a disappointing one to say the least. It has the sleek visual scope that everyone would expect to come from a big- budget MCU entry, but what it has to offer from a narrative standpoint is fairly underwhelming.

""Thor: The Dark World"" boasts a sufficiently complex plot with more than enough grandiose escapades intermingled with amusing antics to keep you distracted throughout its swiftly-paced 112 minutes. The first ""Thor"" came up short on spectacle and surprises, but the sequel delivers several bolts from the blue that keep its outlandish but formulaic shenanigans invigorating. Charismatic performances from the brawny, blond Hemsworth; the brainy, brunette Natalie Portman; the maniacal Christopher Eccleston; and the treacherous Tom Hiddleston enliven this imaginative Marvel Comics entry. Not only does ""Thor: The Dark World"" surpass its humdrum 'origins' predecessor, but it also picks up the saga where the superlative""Avengers"" left off. Indeed, some things haven't changed. Odin isn't entirely pleased with his son's rebellious behavior, and their troubled relationship puts our hero at odds with his one-eyed father.

While I thought the first Thor movie was the worst of the first wave of Marvel movies, I went into this one with high hopes. But within the first five minutes of the movie I was bored out of my mind. Throughout the entire movie NOTHING happens. They spend the entire movie talking about doing something, or talking about things they did off screen. Even the action scenes were incredibly boring. they just bounced around from punch to punch. Nothing really ever gets resolved. Then there's the writing. The characters are very one dimensional. There dialog was very unrealistic. I mean, no one talks like they do in this movie. And there is absolutely no character development, the characters end the movie exactly where they started! Then there's the villain. I love Eccleston. But they didn't give him anything to do. He simply walks on screen, looks at something, then walks off. He's BORING! Just like everything else in this movie. All this movie is capable of is beating you over the head with all of the pretty lights. And while the movie is gorgeous. That doesn't cover the lack of story. In the end, this movie was terrible. It was one of the worst excuses for a movie I have ever seen.",/review/rw2972870/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_The_Dark_World_2013

","As much as the action is intense and the special effects are stunning, the film - in my opinion - was ironically rather dull. There where a few things that made me lose concentration and interest in the film. For example in the middle of a big destruction filled scene, they try to make you laugh. Why? the whole purpose of an action scene is to become fixated on the screen, to hold your breath while chaos ensues. Not to make you laugh. But OK, the action scene resumes and it build and builds and then....yes they try to make you laugh again. And why? Well because when you strip back everything; when you retract the unnecessary comedy; when you holster the money making action scenes; the story is dull. So, they inject a lethal dose of comedy and romance to try and distract you. And hey, there's nothing wrong with adding comedy to give a more varied experience for the viewer, but doing it in the midst of a Malekith (the so called villain of the film; played admirably by Christopher Eccleston) attack is preposterous; all it does is undermine the fear factor that the villain is supposed to carry; he may as well have been wearing a t shirt saying ""i have no chance"". And it was constant; no real focus on the villain, just little bits here and there.

","Thor the Dark World was quite the disappointment. Sure, it was fun to watch, but that was all, and the clichés were quite annoying. Frigga's death was perhaps the most glaring of them. And she dies for the only reason (if you can call that a reason) that they need Odin to loose control and prepare to go after Malekith like an enraged bull (which he never seems to get around to do, leaving everything to Thor once he and Loki get to leave Asgard. Also, Asgard's defenses and army were pathetic. Being caught unawares makes no sense, as Bor was supposed to know that Malekith was alive, and thus so should Odin. And even caught at unawares would not provide for such a ridiculously easy victory by the Dark Elves over Asgardian forces and such a horribly silly idea that Frigga could take care of herself (I mean, seriously, what is the good of having an army in the palace if they can't even guard the queen?). And all that so Thor could be shown as the only one that could fight the Dark Elves. And Odin only gets to kill one with Gungnir!! Of course the cliffhanger at the end was just silly. I believe we are to assume that Loki was disguised as the guard that came to announce the arrival of his ""corpse"" to Odin (considering the sidelong look the guard gave Odin), and thus managed to overpower him somehow (which should be very difficult indeed, but, hey, the movie is way less coherent than the comics, so...). Another thing that annoys me (that was somewhat present in the first movie, but not to this extent) is Odin's and Thor's insistence that Asgardians are not gods. They are! They are the Norse gods. Seriously, I can only think they were afraid of offending the sensibilities of Christians watching the movie, but, come one! Odin is called the All- Father because the is supposed to have created the Nine Worlds. And so on and so forth. Just boring. Ah, by the way, if Asgardians are mortal and not gods at all, why does Odin refer to Jane as ""mortal""? He should have used a term like ""short-lived"" or something like that. Of course the magical day-saving device Erik and Jane put together is not a problem: Marvel does that all the time, like when Dr. Doom manages to create a device that steals the powers of the Beyonder, a being so powerful and alien he should be beyond the understanding of any human without centuries of studies and scientific progress. But Doom, like Reed Richards, is supposed to be a genius, which apparently means, in comic book parlance, he is wiser, more knowledgeable and more intelligent than anyone (except Reed Richards, of course. :) As a final comment, no, the film did not have the promised wider scope: the 9 reals are barely shown, Hogun's village is just as bad as any cheap Conan-like under financed TV production, Svartalfheim is just a desert filmed through darkened lenses, we just get to see enough of Asgard to, as I said, see how badly organized they are, and then we come back to Earth... again! My perfect Thor film would be if they compressed the old Colonizers of Rigel Saga into a movie. No saving the Universe (which is also a boring cliché, like, Thor will only show up on the big screen when he is saving the world), but just fighting an alien race waaaay away from Earth.",/review/rw2972870/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_The_Dark_World_2013

Watching ""Thor: The Dark World 3D,"" however, has cured me of any residual shame in my belief that comic book stories are more cartoonish than cartoons. This movie is just a comic book with lots of frames, and not a good one at that: poorly directed, badly written: ""I believe fate has brought us together."" Argh! 'Kiss' had more subtle makeup. The storyline disintegrates like English cow patties under a cave golem: before there was even light in the universe there were the Dark Elves.

","Disney might think this film made more money than Thor 1 because of it's synergy with the other Marvel superhero films and while that might be true to a certain extent I think it's probably because Thor 2 is simply a much better film than Thor 1. What it does have in common with the Avengers e.g. is an excellent balance of humor, action, effects and drama. We have arrived at a point where VFX can't hardly improve anymore but in The Dark World they pulled out all the stops: we get gorgeous vistas, battles and large scale destruction effects and not a single shot looks fake. Chris Hemsworth also seems to be getting more familiar with his character as his performance has certainly improved.

The part where we see the brotherly interaction as they argue over how to direct the spaceship was adorably accurate and hilarious.

","""Thor: The Dark World"" has problems. Actually, it has a few problems. The battle scenes are generic. The editing is sloppy. There are moments of cheese, and the dialogue needs some spicing up. Most dubious is the confusing main conflict with the forgettable villain, Malekith. However, despite the corniness and the convoluted elements plaguing it, ""The Dark World"" is a highly entertaining, engaging, and surprisingly funny addition to The Avengers universe. In order to buy into these Thor films, one must be okay with Thor being a stupid, albeit fun, Marvel character. Sure, his entire lore is hokey, but it is intentionally so, and the filmmakers behind this installment are well aware of this, using it to their benefit in great humorous effect. And while Portman seems bored playing love interest Jane, most other performances are strong and lively. Hemsworth, Dennings, and Skarsgard are better fleshed out and play their roles with ease. However, the real winner here is Hiddleston, gleefully villainous as Loki, one of the most complex and sympathetic baddies in years. Outside of ""Star Trek"", this is the best big franchise film of the year. Even though Marvel slightly missed the mark with ""Iron Man 3"", they have returned to solid filmmaking form here through great cartoony graphics, unique superhero cinematography and a solid action movie score.

This is a beautiful film that shows off Asgard whenever it suits the story, and I have no problem with that at all. I'd also bring up that this movie offers a lot of development for Loki, and Thor: Ragnarok wouldn't make any sense without his character development in this film. I think post-avengers Loki is my favorite version of the character, he is at peak snarkiness, but we also see actual emotion and sorrow after Frigga's death, which turned out to be a heart-wrenching funeral despite her not being a very developed character. This movie also makes Frigga's appearance in Endgame all the more impactful. Thor receives further development as well. We see him change from being a vengeful war seeking petulant prince into having to become responsible and selfless, even if it means committing treason against his home. This time, Odin is the one making irrational decisions. I think people also forget that this movie introduced an INFINITY STONE. So if nothing else, it's still quite an important film because the Aether is in no other film until Infinity War.

329,5 February 2014,Alterion-me,4," My review of Thor: The Dark World (2013)
","Being directed by Alan Taylor; I had high expectations for this film, even though I don't think I've ever seen one of his films I have watched episodes he has directed for TV (The Sopranos, Rome, and Game of Thrones). Chris Hemsworth reprises his role as Thor and Natalie Portman returns as Jane to re-spark the romance that was (thankfully) left out of The Avengers. One of the first problems I noticed with the film was that the dialogue was really bad; a lot of the time it added nothing to the story or characters. An example of this is that we get the same explanation of the 'Convergence' from about three or four different characters. Yes, I get it; it's a major plot point, MOVE ON! And the time that isn't dedicated to hammering in information that we already know, is filled with unnecessary quips and one-liners. One of the worst culprits of this is Loki; there's almost an entire scene where he just makes some really terrible jokes, I just wanted him to shut up for the rest of the film. Although I will say I do actually like the character of Loki (despite the fake deaths); he is a good character played by a good actor and they do give him some great moments (His part in the ending of the film is pretty cool; don't worry I won't ruin it for you). I did feel that the relationship between him and his ""mother"" Frigga (Rene Russo) was a bit forced as I didn't really get the feeling of a deep connection between those two in the first film. On the other end of the spectrum; a love triangle between Thor, Jane and Sif is introduced and doesn't get built up at all throughout the film, ultimately leading to nothing anyway, so what was the point? Most of the action scenes in this film just made me question how the Asgardians had defeated the Dark Elves before, considering they have those awesome grenades. The film excels in special effects and they did a great job in creating the beautiful Asgard set. With some great music to build the excitement of the scene, it proved to be a really enjoyable piece of action. I was very disappointed to realise that Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) is a terrible villain; firstly I downright didn't like the look of the Dark Elves, their motive was really bad; they don't like the light though at most it's of a slight annoyance to them, like a fly that keeps flying in front of your face (doesn't mean you have to destroy the universe). The Dark Elf on steroids was really the antagonist; if you're going to watch the film, watch it for this guy, he's pretty cool, Malekith just ends up looking like the damsel in distress.

333,19 July 2022,TheHonestCritic,2," This is, without a doubt, one of the worst Marvel films. But, does it have any redeeming qualities? Check out my review below!
","""Thor: The Dark World"" (2013), after being blown away by the first movie; ""Thor"" (2011), I was interested to see if there would be a sequel. But, after a while, I didn't really care if they made one. Maybe because after such a strong first film and especially ""The Avengers"" (2012), it was a tough act to follow. Sure enough, when I went to go see ""Thor: The Dark World"" in the theater, it sucked. It has a very poorly paced and jumbled storyline, the acting is all over the place, all of the sets/locations are boring and the soundtrack is cliched. The plot is, the Dark Elves (yes, you're reading this right, that's actually the name of the villains), are planning to plunge the universe into darkness and it's up to Thor to save the day. Okay, first of all, this story is the epitome of filler. That's one of the biggest problems of the Marvel Cinematic Universe; you have to go through pointless filler to keep you satisfied until the next big on-screen event. The best way to describe ""Thor: The Dark World"" in a nutshell, is filler without substance. I've seen this ""movie"" multiple times, and I cannot remember a single full scene. It's one of the most forgettable Marvel films. I can only recall a few moments and shots. Such as: Thor hanging his hammer Mjolnir on a coat hanger (which is stupid, but somewhat funny). Another thing I remember, is the scene where he destroys the monster and says: ""anyone else?"" Plus, the ending is not too bad, it caught me off-guard when I first saw it. If only the rest of the ""film"" was as good as those parts! You can easily tell that it was directed by someone else. It's more grounded and down to Earth compared to the first one. The first movie was directed by Kenneth Branagh, but this one is directed by Alan Taylor. It was like watching a completely different film! Another issue, is that the tone is inconsistent throughout. Sometimes it has drama, sometimes it has action and once in a while it throws in boring comedic bits to pad out the runtime. On top of that, the villain isn't interesting at all. So, his eventual comeuppance at the end has very little to no satisfaction. The only darkness I experienced, was the movie theater lights going out. Yes, I know I'm making a joke, but the whole theme of darkness in this ""film"" makes it all the more dull to watch. I understand what they were trying to go for, but it didn't work. All we got was nothing but lazy filler to attempt to hold us over until the next ""Avengers"" movie. As for the acting, it's all over the place from every actor and actress. The only ones who seem to be trying with what they had to work with, are: Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston and Anthony Hopkins. Just by pure coincidence, those three were the standout actors from the first film! That being said, unlike the first movie, the acting in this ""film"" is nothing short of a joke. Not even Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston or Anthony Hopkins could redeem it at all! There are some in the cast that do all right, granted. But, the rest of them just suck with their performances! All of the sets/locations are boring and give the ""film"" a dull atmosphere. Yeah, they somehow made Asgard look boring. How is that possible? The only cool locations here in this ""movie"" were in England. You can't go wrong with filming a movie there, or anywhere else in Europe! The soundtrack is about as generic and predictable as you can get. This time, Brian Taylor composed the film score and it's obvious that the soundtrack was written by someone other than Patrick Doyle. There are some parts of the film score that weren't that bad. But honestly, it's nothing to write home about. That's a shame, because Brian Taylor has written much better movie soundtracks! He could've done a much better job with this one. The only positive I can miraculously salvage out of this ""movie"" is the special effects. All of them are well-done and still hold up to this day. Which is no surprise, seeing how it came out in 2013! ""Thor: The Dark World"" is an embarrassing ""film"" in the superhero genre. Is it the worst superhero movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe? No, not by a long shot, as there are much worse films in this franchise as well as other bad superhero movies out there! I'm giving this ""film"" 1 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 2 out of 10 IMDB stars. Just stay away from this ""movie"", you're not missing anything. Even if you're making your way through the Marvel Cinematic Universe for the first time, you can skip this ""film"" and not miss a single thing. ""Thor: The Dark World"" deserves to be banished into darkness under the shadows, and never be seen again. What a pile of filth it is!",/review/rw2972870/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_The_Dark_World_2013

The movie was full of action, which fulfills the audience as they walk out of the theater. On the other hand, comedy took place in many parts throughout the movie. What is more interesting is that most of the comedy was performed by Loki, who everybody knows as a major Marvel Villain besides Dr. Doom and Thanos. The comedy, in my opinion, was there because the success of the Avengers, which had many comedy scenes in it, made this movie likable. This movie totally fixed the things that miss from the first Thor. There were many scenes where they introduced Thor's ability to performed his power in certain ways that no one had ever seen before. The connection of Thor and the people of Asgard and his family was portrayed really well by their language, joke and style of speech. The music was an epic score. It really defined the story and I still could not get it out of my head. It's not as memorable as Pirates of the Caribbean but it definitely built the excitement watching the movie.

'Marvel: The Avengers' franchise has never been this much fun since first 'Iron Man'. Alan Taylor as director dares to take risks in storyline and makes it out from comfort zone. Some action scenes are entertaining and sometimes hilarious, especially when Loki involved. Thor character is shown much more development than the previous movie. In 'The Dark World', Thor is described more grown up and more responsible to save Asgard and Earth from villain's threat. Also the studio has succeeded to exploit Thor's power in this movie that doesn't happen in first franchise or in 'The Avengers'. The presence of Malekith has succeeded enough to give good impression as villain. Perhaps there's quite disorganized in plot and some jokes aren't in the right place. Overall, 'Thor: The Dark World' is one of the most memorable superhero movie this year, also great one from 'The Avengers' franchise.

The second Superman with Christopher Reeves and Spider-man 2 are examples of this.

So we have Jane in London, waiting for Thor to come and Thor trying to find a way to go back to her. In other ways the movie is quite entertaining and enjoyable.

This is the problem with Thor, you just get tired while watching it. Thor just isn't drawn in this installment interesting enough.

I will say that of the entire Avengers saga the first Thor was my favorite movie. Due to that I had pretty high expectations for this one. I won't say I was disappointed because I did like it but I didn't think it was as good as the first one. They can only do the superhero saving Earth story so many times so with this one they added the threat to Thor's home world as well. Most of the movie takes place on Asgard so that aspect was nice and it did have a fair amount of comedy to keep it entertaining all the way through. There was just something missing in this one that the first one had. I don't know if it was because my expectations for this one were much higher then the original but I didn't have the same enjoyment from this one the other had.

Loki is the best thing that happened to this movie. if Loki was not in the movie, i would have rated it 8/10. The second half is clearly better than the first half. But the first half consists of some excellent scenes like Frigga's funeral which are beautifully shot and create magic.

Was the public ready to take to an actual hammer wielding God played by a then virtually unknown Australian actor in a setting that seemed ripe for parody? In 2014 the answer is an overwhelming yes with Thor and in a real world sense Chris Hemsworth becoming one of the most popular Marvel screen incarnations but with this popularity comes more expectation. The original Thor was a pleasantly entertaining surprise directed with a stately manner by Brit Kenneth Branagh so how does the sequel match up? The worst thing about Thor: The Dark World is just how achingly predictable the whole plot line is and if it were not for that there is much to enjoy in this sequel that doesn't take itself too seriously and features a rampant pace that is missing in many middling Blockbusters of recent times. Most scenes in the movie feel well paced and edited with barely a moment in between set pieces to catch your breathe. It's perhaps thanks to Game of Thrones mainstay and now Dark World director Alan Taylor that the film plays out in such a manner and produces some at times highly impressive visuals and vistas.

388,8 November 2013,poe426,7," Thor- a bore...?
","Given the possibilities, it's more than a little disappointing that the makers of THOR: THE DARK WORLD would opt to do a story about ""dark elves."" For one thing, there WERE no dark elves in the original comics- not ONE, that I can recall. (Granted, ""this ain't your daddy's Thor,"" but it IS, just revamped for today's less discriminating moviegoers.) Why not do a story about Ulik, mightiest of the Rock Trolls...? ('Cause this ain't your daddy's Thor...?) To see the mighty troll marshal his army to invade Asgard itself would've been great. Consider: We see an Asgradian outpost on the edge of the Troll Lands. Battle-armored trolls attack the outpost (using the widest array of weapons imaginable, forged in their underground furnaces). Cut to another outpost, as trolls emerge from underground to attack and capture it. Thor (wearing his trademarked helmet, which he DOESN'T in THOR: THE DARK WORLD) gathers his men for a counter-attack. The armies battle to a standstill- at which point Ulik steps forth to challenge Thor to a one-on-one slugfest (no cgi, just breakaway boulders and such). Here, we discover that Loki has had a hand in the troll invasion, giving them strategic information every step of the way. Thor, to overcome superior numbers, calls forth a thunderstorm that wipes the troll army back from whence it came. Compare THAT scenario to what we see in THE DARK WORLD. I don't think I've seen a movie with so many clichéd lines in quite a while. While the makeup effects and the cgi are better than in the first film, the story is every bit as ponderous: scenes drag on interminably at times, with pompous characters hammering the point(s) mercilessly- and the attempts at humor, while they might garner the occasional chuckle, are sophomoric at best and are used more often than not to undermine the ""seriousness"" of the situation(s). And am I the only one more than a little tired of the post-credit ""tag"" scenes? (We were subjected to a half hour of television commercials prior to half an hour of previews BEFORE the movie started- then we had to sit through ten minutes of production crew credits before the last scene.

","Feeling a bit uninspired- but entertaining nevertheless, Thor The Dark World takes a darker stance on the mythology and world of the titular character- and certainly does not deserve the hate it so often receives. Many people consider this film the worst MCU flick, but honestly I just feel it's rather average. Due to being pressed for time and bad reception in independent groupings, Marvel struggled to make the release date for this film with its fast paced editing- and I feel oddly enough thats the films biggest downfall. It isn't a bad film in the slightest, but the editing throughout feels a bit rushed and the monotonous tone it gives throughout just gives the film a rather bland vibe. It could have easily been a strongly toned film, with its nightmarish dark imagery throughout, but it feels like Disney wasn't able to compile the film in the best way in time for it to reach the potential it had. That being said, I enjoyed the film for what it was. It was interesting to watch, and it takes its story very seriously, of which I found to be interesting- despite it being a much slower pace than the first. The acting is very well done, and the look of the film is incredible. Between the imagery, set design, and costumes- you will effortlessly be impressed by all the style of this film alone- which is brilliantly conceived. In the end, it's the editing that weighs this film down as a whole, making it glimmer instead of purely shining like it could have.

","First off, I have to say that I went charging into the movie theater not having a clue what this movie was going to be about. I wanted to see it because Thor is my favorite Marvel series, and I didn't have any expectations set besides hoping this Thor would have a lot less romance than the last Thor and that the movie would spend most of its time anywhere but Earth. I was pleasantly surprised. Most of the movie took place on Asgard and other planets. Of course there was romance, but I felt like it had its place and didn't interfere with the plot. Darcy and Ian's little romance was lighthearted enough that it was enjoyable to see. After Jane was taken to Asgard, my biggest fear was that she was going to somehow end up immortal by the end of the movie so she could live with Thor, since Odin had brought up several comments on how Jane's life would be over in a flash compared to Thor's. While the bit about the ""the entire universe hangs in the balance"" is so old it has mold growing on it, I liked how the movie didn't end right after the Aether was extracted from Jane. To me, this gave more strength towards Thor's character flaw. He created an elaborate plan just to get Jane off of Asgard and even chose to work with Loki, yet he still failed and Loki (seemingly, at the time) paid with his life. I felt that Malekith should have been elaborated on more; he would have been a more interesting character if we knew who he was and why exactly he wanted to commit evil deeds. Besides this, the movie was fantastic. Although Kurse was a bit hard to take seriously because his helmet-thing bore close resemblance to a warthog in my eyes. The music fit well with the scenes, the deaths and Loki's supposed death were emotional enough for me (although I felt like Thor's reaction towards his brother's death was rushed; he and Jane took off after Thor watched Loki die in his arms). Loki's humor was brilliant, although I don't quite understand why we had to keep watching Erik running around nude on the television — we saw it once and I think once got the point across well enough. I thought the funeral scene was beautiful and emotional at the same time, and I can never get enough of Asgard's night sky. I also liked how Heimdall was given more of a part in this movie; he's a cool character who didn't get enough screen time in the original Thor. I also happened to see this movie in 3D and I'm a person who wears glasses and does not own contacts, so I usually resent going to see movies in 3D, but this movie was so worth it and I would actually go to a 3D showing again.",/review/rw2972870/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_The_Dark_World_2013

","The sequel to what was the worst film in the MCU managed to achieve something: it stole that title from it's predecessor. Despite a hokey narration that sets up the plot, 'Thor: The Dark World' starts off promisingly with a good action sequence and re-introduction to Asgard, but it soon becomes clear that the film is aimless. Far too much time is spent with the uninteresting 'Earth characters', and the pacing is terrible. Even when the action finally begins, it's boring. Sure, the special effects look good, but we don't care about them because we don't care about the characters. On top of that, the film has what is probably the worst villain of the entire MCU and it has horrible cinematography. At least it has a better handle of tone than the first and the camera is held straight.

","The second installment of the saga of the God of Thunder is rocking awesome!!! I haven't had so much fun in a movie theater since THE LORD OF THE RINGS. It's that good. The Hobbit on the other hand isn't near close. Thor is nothing like the other Marvel movies about super heroes. This one is a totally different animal. It is up there with the big boys-Star Wars, Star Trek and The Lord of The Rings. I could tell that the movie crew spent a good amount of time to make it right. This is not a fast production for easy cash ins. This one is The Real Deal-A True Movie Magic! I was a bit afraid that the second one is not going to match the quality of the first one. I mean how do you top the scene where Thor is being cast out of Asgard by his father Odin. The level of acting delivered by Anthony Hopkins was just awe inspiring! Well, the second one has few of those scenes and it just keeps delivering. How long has it been since I wanted to see a movie over again. Thor and Thor 2-Tthe Dark World are an instant classic and as I love to say: Do yourselves a favor and see those two movies! I recommend regular projection over 3d screening since the film was originally shot in 2d and was meant to be viewed in 2d. It is cheaper too. Actually if you go to a morning projection in any theater you will pay close to nothing. I payed only $6.00! If you don't want to pay that you can always rent it off of the RED BOX kiosks for a dollar and some cents(the movie will take a few months to be available to rent).

His loved one is cool Jane Foster played beautifully by talented Natalie Portman. But the most lovable character remains his cunning, clever, cool, likable evil brother Loki played by Tom Hiddleston. In fact he is my second favorite villain after Joker of The Dark Knight in todays superhero universe. Visual effects vary from fantastic to excellent to mind-blowing. Stakes are much higher this time, but movie never tries to take them too seriously. In fact there are lot of funny situations and one liners but this fun was overdone in the messy climax.

","An American fantasy adventure; A story about an ancient weapon, the Aether, which is found by a woman who becomes its host, forcing a Norse mythological God of Thunder, Thor, to bring her to Asgard, a distant planetary body, before the weapon is used for intergalatic mayhem. The first film had some interesting and at times amusing backstory. This installment is weighed down by over-explanation, a convoluted plot, and poor editing. Some action scenes prove too fast for the viewer to enjoy - splendorous CGI worlds that the production's visual artists went to so much trouble of imagining and realising on screen were lost to frenetic and choppily edited scenes of fighting. The film is tongue-in-cheek as much as it is far-fetched - characters who habitate in London have no need for intergalatic travel because an intergalatic threat comes to them. However, the main problem is a lack of tension in the story. Thor is not vulnerable enough for the audience to believe that he is not going to win the day. Altogether it is an overwrought production - pounding music, incessant battle scenes, spacecraft kinetics, all to force audience distraction from the modes script. When you've seen the 'high striker' a couple of times at the fair you need something new and Thor lacks dimension when he's expected to carry the whole film without much new backstory extended to him.

","So a year on since the Avengers assembled and Loki has been in prison while Thor is making peace in the Nine Realms while the Bifrost was being rebuilt. So after all that is explained in the first 10 minutes we get to the story line which revolves around a Dark Elf known as Malekith and his search/revenge plans. Christopher Eccleston did a very interesting role although after watching I think he didn't own it, other people could have done it as well, if not better. That didn't ruin it though as another, unexpected, plot point revolves around Loki and the issues of trusting him which make for some very twisty and questionable scenes. I'd have to say I enjoyed the parts set on Earth more rather than in space for some reason, but all in all I liked how it looked although some elements I had seen before in other media. There were of course references to past films as the Tesseract got a mention as did New York. So my final thoughts are this: the special effects were great, the plot was OK but I've seen better, and all-in-all I have the same feel about it as the first, it didn't wow me but neither was I bored, it was just in the middle.",/review/rw2972870/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_The_Dark_World_2013

","Most importantly, The Dark World felt like a post-Avengers story, both plot-wise and in the characters' arcs, whereas Iron Man 3 felt like it could have been told before the Avengers with little difference. Hemsworth again vanishes into his role, and Hiddleston is as slimy as ever. The humor was probably some of the sharpest and least forced of all Marvel's movies so far, with everyone really upping their game. I loved the change from Shakespearean drama to Lord of the Rings-style fantasy; it really allowed for some epic locations and battles, while overall showcasing some new sides to Asgard and the universe in general. The use of various color palettes was genius, changing from greys to greens to oranges and browns really differentiated the worlds and tones. The plot mechanisms also gave way to some of the most inventive and thrilling battle sequences I've seen. If Man of Steel dragged a bit for you in the battles, you'll probably feel the opposite here. In fact, the entire film clips along briskly and could stand an extended cut. I was just sad when it ended; I wanted more. Some clever twists and turns kept me completely invested in the characters and story. Unfortunately, an undeveloped villain left a lot to be desired, and prevents it from ranking as Marvel's best for me. But for sheer exhilaration, it parallels Marvel's The Avengers and Man of Steel, earning bonus points for the change to outright fantasy genre Thor belongs in, as well as some brilliant tie-ins to Viking culture. There were also some very appreciated nods to the first film, and a scene that will take you so off guard you'll need the movie to pause just to recover - in a good way.",/review/rw2972870/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_The_Dark_World_2013

","Thor: The Dark World is being considered the worst in the whole MCU franchise by many, but I personally think it was far more entertaining than many others.

","Many people criticize Marvel for not exploring a more serious tone in their productions, but at the beginning of the second phase they ended up trying to do this with some films, in some moments it worked and in others not. And with Thor, did it work? Unfortunately I have to say it didn't work. Exploring a darker side of space and making Thor a more serious character is indeed a very good idea, but one that was poorly executed. The film has plenty of jokes as usual, but at times it really struggles to be truly dark. The problem is that they try to do this only by making the photograph darker and a generic villain looking menacing. If the film could develop a scarier story with more terrifying scenarios, it would be much better.",/review/rw2972870/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_The_Dark_World_2013

","Thor: The Dark World is the 8th installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A universe that is an incredible feat in movie-making. Sure, not all the movies have been mind blowing but that doesn't change the fact that what Marvel/Disney is doing is changing movies, more notably the big blockbuster films. They have these intertwined films in a way that we've never really seen before, it's all one big universejust like a comic book. And I love it. As for this 2nd installment in the Thor franchise, it's pretty good, is it the best of the Marvel Cinematic Universe? No, not really. But, it is certainly an improvement over the 1st film. The movie opens with an opening narration just like the first one about the Dark Elf Malekith who wants to destroy the universe using a weapon named the Aether. This takes place a long time before the days of Odin's rule and involved Odin's father, Bor. Time passes after the Dark Elves have failed and we turn back to Thor in present day.

","When the original Thor was released back in 2010, it had everything, gutsy action sequences, humor, heart, you name it, it had it. Thor was a thoroughly enjoyable comic book adaptation. Now, Thor: The Dark World has just been released and while it maintains some awesome action sequences and some humor to keep it going, it does lack some of the emotion that made its predecessor so good. Not by any means is Thor: The Dark World a bad film, quite the contrary, it is a very well made film and features some of the coolest action sequences we've seen in 2013. However, this sequel seems to dwell on the coattails of the original and never seems to fully stand on its own two legs. Featuring one awesome performance from Tom Hiddleston as Loki, the rest of actors seem to fall beneath him and end up being lackluster compared to him. Chris Hemsworth does what he can with the role but there isn't too much more that he could do with the character of Thor that he didn't do in the original, so therefore, I can't fully put him at fault. The rest of the cast ends up being an afterthought when the end credits roll. The biggest failure of Thor: The Dark World is that it tries to best the original by adding more action and less story (something that sequels are infamous for). Now, while the action sequences are undeniably cool and entertaining, there isn't much more to it. The threat doesn't feel real in this outing and that brings the film down from where it could have been. With that being said, the bright side is that the action sequences are so well done and Hiddleston is outstanding as Loki, I can't fully disregard this film. As for the holiday season coming along, Thor: The Dark World is an awesome outing to take the family to. Other than that, it is pure eye candy and there isn't anything wrong with that.",/review/rw2972870/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_The_Dark_World_2013

Still, Thor: the dark world has enough humor, story, and good plot/action to overlook at this slight problem... I want to note down that toward the beginning we have a series of events that reminds deeply of the phenomenas described in the novel 'Roadside picnic' of the strugackij brothers, the original story that inspired Tarkovskij's eternal sci-fi classic, Stalker; therefore I really appreciated that maybe unwanted reference.

","The Odinson returns in his second solo venture, more grandiose than the last, but still very close in narrative make-up to its predecessor, despite a change of director. Kenneth Branagh declined the offer to helm this second installment while female director Patty Jenkins was fired early on, at which point Game of Thrones director Alan Taylor took over the reins, and quite successfully so. The Shakespearean overtones are nevertheless kept in, only enlarged by his Martinian experience with grand halls, epic battles and conniving siblings, all too similar in nature to the subject matter so far. After leaving the Avengers and returning home with his captive brother Loki, Thor (Chris Hemsworth more beefed up than ever) has been kept busy for two years fighting rampaging marauders and other dangers to cosmic stability across the Nine Realms. Meanwhile, his human love Jane (Natalie Portman) also hasn't taken time off in search for her divine boytoy by using every scientific means at her disposal. On investigation in Britain, she stumbles upon a portal to another place where she is infected by the Aether, a dangerous, ancient material that is the key energy source of the largely extinct Dark Elves that once battled the Asgardians for dominance in times immemorial, and lost. Sensing the Aether has awoken, the few remaining members of this shadowy race prepare for another shot at universal power grabbing under the leadership of the wrathful Malekith (Christopher Eccleston wearing creepy make-up). When they unexpectedly assault Asgard and kill Thor's mother, the distraught wielder of the powerful hammer Mjölnir disobeys his heavenly father's commands and recruits his untrustworthy brother Loki (an impeccable Tom Hiddleston, again playing the trickster god with the usual vigour that makes him the most fascinating Marvel villain of them all) to defeat the Dark Elves before their nefarious plans for Jane and the universe are brought to their catastrophic conclusion. The only bond that shares them at this point in their overly tumultuous relationship is the mutual love for their mother's memory: otherwise there is no trust or love lost between them. Will Thor manage to save his girlfriend and everything else, without ending with a knife in his back at the hands of his seemingly imbalanced brother, or crushed by the ever stronger Malekith? It will remain to be seen during a bombastic battle in the British capital (instead of set in the States, as has been usual in Marvel movies thus far).",/review/rw2972870/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_The_Dark_World_2013

","The first Thor was a fun, entertaining movie, that featured interesting characters and a very interesting story (I simply love myths and legends), along with good acting and a great villain. It wasn't a masterpiece, but nobody should expect too much of a superhero movie: they are all made to entertain with enjoyable sci-fi mumbo jumbo and some fan service for the female public – which is kind of unusual, since men are the main target audience of superhero movies, and we haven't had any relevant/good female superhero movies recently (or even ever?). But I digress; the important thing here is that the first Thor was good and – according to the superhero movie rule – the sequel should have been even better: was it? Thor: The Dark World starts by telling a myth about Dark Elves, their lord Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) and how he wanted to send the whole Universe into darkness by using a strange substance called the Aether, but was defeated by Asgardians. In the present, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is still waiting for Thor (Chris Hemsworth) to return after two years, and investigates all anomalies she encounters. Such an anomaly makes her invisible to Heimdall (Idris Elba) for some time, so Thor, worried, comes to take her to Asgard, where they discover that the Aether runs through her veins and is slowly killing her. Chaos ensues as Dark Elves attack Asgard and Thor has to team up with Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to stop them.",/review/rw2972870/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_The_Dark_World_2013

Personally in comparison of my favorite hero in the avenger team Thor comes at last,,,,my favorite is cap America then iron man then hulk and then Thor,,,,and i haven't liked the first part of Thor much,,,,yes it was not bad but was not very good also .... But its sequel is really interesting,,,,.... The story starts in the same manner in which iron man 3 has started,,,,after the event of the avenger in new York....Thor is back to Asgard with Loki,,,,of coarse Loki was kept in prison....In the same time in some other part of the world,,,,the king of darkness was planning something bad.... The plot of the movie was not much interesting as compared to captain America or the avenger with some physics here and there etc.....But was good enough to hold u to your seats,,,,Whats actually rise your interest while watching the movie is the screenplay,,,,how a not so interesting plot was shown in an interesting form,,,,that's the strength of marvel comics,,,,they don't give enough strength on the plot as DC comics does,,,,instead of that they make there screenplay interesting,,,,and Thor 2 has a lot of humour jokes which will make u laugh rolling down your seat in the whole movie.... No doubt the action sequence are good too,,,,i haven't seen the movie in 3d but it was good in 2d too.... The best thing in the movie was the character of Loki(remember the villain from the avenger)....This time he was in the right side helping Thor but for his own profit,,,,and i guarantee u this man has a high sense of humour and is the most charming and 2nd most interesting villain (after joker from dark knight) in all time Hollywood movie....The chemistry between Thor and Loki is too good.... Natalia Portman is an Oscar winner actress,,,,she can do a superhero's love lady role with closed eyes,,,,so she was good enough too.... Yes Thor is not up to the mark like the avenger but it will have enough interesting stuff to make u engage till cap America 2 and the avenger 2 will come.... I will go for 3.5 out of 5 ,,,,....

The sequel, though by no means lacking in the laughs department, takes a darker approach to the continuity, with considerably more action than its predecessor. The acting is still commendable across the board, but it is Tom Hiddleston who delivers the breakout performance, perfectly showcasing the pent-up rage Loki has against the world that has exiled him. This time, Asgard is under seige by an ancient enemy known as the Dark Elves. The action has a sort of stormtroopers-vs.-Ewoks vibe, as the Dark Elves cut down the sword-wielding Asgardians with energy-based projectile weapons.

","This entry in the MCU did much more to advance Loki's character than Thor's, and I'm fine with that because Loki is the most loved/hated, complicated and misunderstood villain/anti-hero in the MCU. In Dark World, Loki had the greatest character arc, from being imprisoned and indifferent to his family, and of questionable loyalty and trustworthiness, to agonizing the death of his mother, and ultimately saving Asgard although remaining mysterious and mischievous throughout. We last see Loki on a great setup for the opening of the third installment. Good humor throughout the film, especially from Professor Selvig. The romance between Thor and Jane Foster was unfortunately a little flat but honestly I think that has less to do with the screenplay and a lot to do with Natalie Portman's acting (she's gorgeous, just not exactly the most convincing actress). I'm not sure how Thor's love life plays out in the comics, I'm sure he ends up with Jane Foster, but I think they should have kept things more interesting with Sif, somewhat of competition for Thor's heart, except Sif never even had a chance which is really a shame, script-wise; a missed opportunity. We don't see anything new from Thor in Dark World, just some additional humbling-down that we saw from him in the first Thor movie when he started off so arrogant, spoiled and entitled, and now he's decided that he'd rather be a superhero than king.",/review/rw2972870/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_The_Dark_World_2013

","Thor was one of my favorite of the Marvel Phase 1 movies. I loved it's fun mix of fantasy and real world adventure and thought Hemsworth made a noble and very likable hero. And now the Norse God turned superhero is back in his second solo adventure and a welcome return it is. Thor: The Dark World opens 5000 years earlier with an alignment of the planets being taken advantage of by the Dark Elves and their leader Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) to unleash a weapon called The Aether which will convert all the worlds into dark matter where only the Dark Elves may exist. Thor's grandfather Bor (Tony Curran) defeats the invaders and they are assumed destroyed and The Aether is hidden away never to be found... or so Bor hoped. But, in the present, the worlds are aligning again and the long dormant Malekith and the remaining Dark Elves seek to destroy all once more and, as fate would have it, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) stumbles upon the hidden weapon and it is absorbed within her. Now hunted by Malekith, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) brings Jane to Asgard against Odin's (Anthony Hopkins) wishes and must somehow find a way to stop Malekith, banish The Aether and save the woman he loves and all the known worlds... and the only one who can help him is his devious step brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) imprisoned in Asgard's dungeons by Thor's own hand. This second solo adventure is this time directed by Game Of Thrones and Deadwood director Alan Taylor who creates a much grittier and down to Earth version of Asgard then the bright and magic kingdom-ish version we saw in the delightful first feature directed by Kenneth Branagh. It's still recognizable as Asgard and it blends perfectly with the first Thor but, we get to see far deeper into the city and into it's halls and pubs and get a more lived in and functional look at Thor's homeland. The tone of the film is also darker at times and that was a nice change from the upbeat first film and Avengers but, so not to get too dark or grim, the film is punctuated with a lot of fun and humorous sequences especially those involving Darcy (Kat Dennings) and Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard), the latter's trip to Stonehenge being especially hilarious. I thought the humor and the darker story elements were blended just fine and there was plenty of action and strong drama throughout till the big free-for-all ending set in London where Thor and Malekith finally get to throw down. And the action and special effects do not disappoint, they are top notch as all the previous Marvel films. The budget is on screen in all aspects from sets to costumes to FX. Taylor gets good work from all the cast. There are some nice character moments in between the drama and destruction and all the actors are now very comfortable in their roles and work very well together. Hemsworth is once again a noble hero who has grow since his first visit and the battle in New York. He and Portman still have a nice chemistry together and I liked their scenes especially when Thor has to explain where he's been for two years. Dennings gets a bit more screen time and handles it well getting some of the bigger laughs and Hiddleston is once again scene stealing as Loki. It was also nice to see Rene Russo get a big scene and have a bit bigger part this time and Hopkins is still endearing as the weary but, majestic Odin. We also get some nice scenes with supporting characters Heimdall (Idris Elba), Sith (Jaimie Alexander), Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Fandral (now Zachary Levi) and Hogun (Tadanobu Asano) but, those expecting expanded roles from this bunch will be disappointed. Newcomer to Thor's world Christopher Ecceleston, is OK as villain Malekith but, he really doesn't make a strong impression or stay with you after the film is over. To me his somewhat tepid villain is the film's only real stand out weak point. Taylor's interpretation of Don Payne and Robert Rodat's script is highlighted by a moody score by Brian May and some nice cinematography by Kramer Morgenthau. Overall, Thor: The Dark World is a very entertaining follow-up that gives us enough of the action, drama and suspense we are looking for and takes it in enough of a different direction to keep it fresh but, not straying too far to alienate us. It's not perfect, as stated the villain could have been stronger, there are a few slows spots here and there especially in the first half and earlier on we can tell there was a bit of editing to manage the running time but, for all the entertainment we get, those minor flaws can be overlooked. A fun and worthy sequel to both Thor and The Avengers and certainly less schizophrenic then the mixed bag that was Iron Man 3. As with all Marvel films stay through the entire credits for not one but, two additional sequences and keep an eye out for a couple of really fun cameos. Another solid bit of entertainment from Marvel and Disney.",/review/rw2972870/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_The_Dark_World_2013

Natalie Portman returns as Jane Foster as well who finds what is called Aether which is used by evil beings known as dark elf's that Asgard once fought and defeated, which is placed inside her, that also forces Thor to bring her to Asgard to extract it before it's used by the dark elf's to destroy the nine realms. Anthony Hopkins returns as Odin and honestly this is probably my favorite performance of him portraying the character. Tom Hiddleston is definitely the standout character Loki that is dealing with the consequences of his destruction of New York , while also slowly coming around to help Thor against the dark elf's. Christopher Eccleston who plays the villain Malekith I thought was alright, but is probably one of my only cons I have with this film and the dark elf's itself. To me, I felt they weren't as menacing as they were intending to make them be, but in the end, they made it work for the film. I was also glad we got to see a little more of the world of Asgard and it's side characters in action such as Heimdall played by Idris Elba, Sif played by Jaime Alexandra, Fandral who has been recasted and played by Zachery Levi, and Volstagg played by Ray Stevenson. Overall, Thor: The Dark World is far from the worst MCU film as it's explores more of the world of Asgard, it's characters, and sets up the MCU for what's to come.

","The strain of intense serialization takes a toll on ""Thor: The Dark World,"" the eighth film in Marvel's on-going cinematic universe. Natalie Portman is back as Thor's earthly romantic interest, Jane Foster, which necessitates a slightly awkward part-explanation, part-avoidance of why Thor seemed to forget she existed during the events depicted in ""The Avengers,"" in which Jane did not appear. Coming up with a compelling story that is about 70% a continuation of ""Thor"" and 30% a continuation of ""The Avengers"" and fits into the larger, on-going MCU story line that is supposed to culminate somewhere down the road paved with Infinity Stones is a tall order, and the multiple writers don't quite pull it off. Neither, however, do they completely fumble, and Alan Taylor's serviceable direction as well as a solid cast most of whom we're familiar with do a good job of smoothing over the rough spots as much as possible. The cast is really the best feature -- Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston are by now so comfortable with each other that it is easier that ever to believe these two were raised as brothers, it's good to see Portman again and Kat Dennings as Jane's sister is more of an asset to the story (and slightly less annoying) than she was in ""Thor,"" Rene Russo as Thor's mother gets more to do, and there are a few pleasant if minor additions to the human side of the story, including Jonathan Howard and Chris O'Dowd.",/review/rw2972870/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_The_Dark_World_2013

","The Marvel Universe is without any doubt one of those Hollywood hypes I just can't get my head around. What is it that makes people fall in love with those superheroes who are no more than embodiments of the American value-system? And, even more so, why are the bad guys always in business with (semi-)communists, (Arabian) terrorists or evil (Russian or Asian) scientists? The clichés are too much for me. Maybe it's because I'm European. But that doesn't explain why so many Europeans dig this franchise. So maybe it has nothing to do with all that and it's just plain old Hollywood: looking for the greatest common divisor to capitalize on, in other words the best commercial formula for the highest profit. When realizing this it isn't all too bad to watch those Marvel films, 'cause it's only Hollywood numbness and as a viewer you just need to lower yourself to that level. It then also becomes possible to measure those movies against each other. When doing so the pattern - for me - gets quite clear: the second phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World, Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy) is way better than the first one (which only had The Avengers that distinguished itself).

","Thor the dark world is by far the goofiest of the marvel films thus far. Also the most head scratching. It makes you wonder what they were trying to achieve and what was the point. It's a mishmash of all fantasy franchises before, themes of lord of the rings, star wars, game of thrones, and even pirates of the Caribbean. Its shot very dark with amazing looking villains who look extra evil. Irritatingly not used to their full potential. Being so dark they also shoehorn out of place humor that is confusing and mostly misses its mark. This film also has some of the best visuals and effects in the entire marvel universe.

","Although Thor, the namesake of the movie series, is masculinity incarnate; there is little doubt that the audience is not really impressed by the hammer brandishing deity - likely because Thor pales in comparison whenever the arch villain Loki makes an appearance. Perhaps one should congratulate Marvel on the success of creating this charismatic evil character who even dominates The Avengers, not to mention the spawning of countless fanfiction and secondary creation. Marvel needs to work on the storyline as it is stretching thin, what is the remote probability of all this new dark energy targeting Thor's ladylove as a host, out of zillions of beings to choose from the vast universe with the nine realms? The plot feels flimsy to begin with, and though the brilliant coup and contracoup actions by the brothers near the end are exciting, the actual final scene is an inevitable anticlimax and seems like child's play.

If you expect Shakespearean depths... well if the fact that its a movie based on a comic book based on North mythology chewed by Uncle Sam didn't give you a hint its might not be your type of movie, i don't know what would have? For most of the part the film dose good with what its aims for... i think (i mean i never read any Thor comic book which i could compare it too)It has its moments, even though there are things that are pretty easy to figure out like the romance between Daisy and the intern. And sometimes the movie is stupid like when you put so much focus on Loki can not be trusted. Like 4 characters say ""he will betray you"" than 4 characters tell him ""i will kill you, if you betray Thor"" and Thor admits it he counting on Loki trying to betray him, and says like 2 times he dose not trust him. There plan depends on Lokis ability's of creating illusions. And its not like he did something terrible twice... oh wait he did. So after this much build up not even going ""hm... maybe i should really check if his really dead, or not just let him lay on the ground"" is the stupidest thing you can do. Its like Batman putting the Joker in a room with innocent people and going ""they will be fine"" If you just want some fun without too high expectations you probably will like it.

","Thor: The Dark World is a movie I have been waiting for a long time. I really enjoyed the first (no matter how average people thought it) and the trailer for the sequel looked awesome. And I hoped it was awesome. Was it awesome? Almost. This movie takes place a few years after The Avengers. The nine realms are at peace until all of a sudden, evil is released. Best synopsis ever. As plots go, it's pretty good. It stays true to the superhero formula and has a couple of plot twists. One is a complete surprise, one is completely predictable. However, there are a lot of plot holes in this movie. Often in the movie, I was scratching my head thinking, ""Wait, how would that work?"" That kind of detracts from the movie a little. Now, I'm going to be straight with you. For the first forty minutes or so, I was thinking, ""Okay, this movie is having a hard time going anywhere."" Yeah, it starts out rough. The beginning of the movie starts out rather dull. It had a hard time pulling me in and keeping me invested. But, when things started going down and punches were thrown, that's when things got interesting. It turned out to be a fun movie, but I wish it had the same charm from the beginning. Speaking of charm, this movie is very funny. It's the funniest Marvel movie since The Avengers (which isn't saying much because the only other Marvel movie that came out after The Avengers is Iron Man 3, but it's still the funniest). There were chuckle moments and even moments that had me laughing out loud. However, there were some jokes that felt stale. Most of them came from Kat Denning's character. I think she's very cute, but she didn't really have that much of a point in this movie. The action is what you'd except in a superhero movie; action packed awesomeness. And that's what this movie has. It was just cool seeing Thor wipe out a bunch of people with his hammer. IT'S SO SATISFYING! Overall, this movie is good. It isn't quite as good as the original Thor, but I still enjoyed it. It's definitely a worthy successor to The Avengers and it's definitely worth checking out.

","It was around this time that I had become a massive fan of Thor, even making him my favourite among the Avengers. So, I was excited for this film because of that and because, from the trailers and marketing, we were going to get some incredible Thor action... Suffice it to say, this is probably the most forgettable film in the MCU, but still not a terrible film.
POSITIVES!
It was really in this film that both Hemsworth and Hiddleston knew the ins and outs of their respective characters. Hemsworth is a much better performer in this film bringing elements we saw in the first film and the grownup character we saw in The Avengers. Hiddleston is just a terrific performer and, as a character, has had a terrific growth. There are some very terrific visual effects when it comes to the entertaining action sequences involving Thor and his hammer, Mjölnir. There's the vastly engaging costume design in the returning characters but within those action sequences you have the background with its practical and character design. The sound within those sequences is all very strong and present. And another great score from Brian Tyler that really fits that character and world.
MIXED!
Now when it comes to the plot and story of the film, it would be a negative, but it revolves around what would later be known for building up to Infinity War. The reason it would be a negative is because the story is just dull. Made even more so by the actors and filmmakers involved. Moving to the art direction of the film, even though it is immaculate and terrifically built it adds to my thought process of the Thor franchise having a very inconsistent tone as this is a lot darker than the film prior.
NEGATIVES!
Let's start off with the writing of the film. Like I said, this film is perhaps the most forgettable entry in the MCU. Nothing about the entire story sticks with you after the viewing. That's why this is a very difficult movie to review. This film doesn't care about building any other character besides Thor and Loki. The antagonist of Malekith for instance is the worst villain in the MCU because audiences know nothing about him. Christopher Eccleston gives it his all in the role, but the writers don't care about him because he is not Thor or Loki. All the humour is mishandled. Thor's weak supporting cast is still that. The ""chemistry"" between Thor and Jane is non-existent and even Natalie Portman feels as if she doesn't care. I forgot to mention Kat Dennings in the first movie, but as the comedic character she is terrible. Moving onto directing. Patty Jenkins was meant to direct this, and she wanted to focus on the relationship between Thor and Jane and add to that Shakespearean tone that the first film set up. Taylor is known for Game of Thrones (and ruining Terminator even more) and this feels like an offbeat and uninteresting GOT episode.
CONCLUSION!
So, Thor: The Dark World (also a boring title) is an extremely mediocre. Although it has its impressive devices within the filmmaking process, it fails to capture what makes an MCU film fun and engaging. And instead aims for a darker approach that upsets the tone the MCU has cemented and goes against what the first Thor accomplished in tone and storytelling. In the moment the film can be enjoyable with its action sequences and where the film takes the characters of Thor and Loki, everything else, afterwards, falls flat in comparison.",/review/rw2972870/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_The_Dark_World_2013

","Thor: The Dark World. Now with most new movies I review this review may contain SPOILERS so read at your own risk. Thor: The Dark World improves on many flaws of the first Thor, like probably my biggest problem with the first Thor was that the 9 realms were way to polished and neat in this movie the realms look more like actual places that have dirt and muck. And also Asgard looks much more Viking-like and that makes a whole lot of sense considering the Norse mythology was created by Vikings. In this movie Thor got to do more Thor-like things with his power, and be more of a hero. Thor The Dark World also threw in more creatures they all looked pretty cool especially the secondary villain Kurse, he was big, and violent a real Challenger to Thor sadly I felt he didn't get enough screen time. Thats one of the problems with the movie, the villains were really cool but had no were near enough screen time, like Malekith, great design from adapting a comic to a movie, cool powers, good threat, worthy enemy, threatening but in the end he was only on screen for like 17 minutes, I fell they should've cut out parts of the Earth scenes and replaced it with more Malekith and Kurse scenes. On Earth there were two characters in particular that the whole movie could have doe without, the two interns (I know they probably have names but I didn't care enough to remember them) they annoyed the crap out of me, I hated them really took the movie down a notch. But out of the negatives there were some positives that outweighed them, the character of Thor was much more heroic and godlike, Loki's back and he's good in the movie and doesn't overstay his welcome, the fights were great very imaginative especially the final fight with portals and realm jumping. Now some cameos that I noticed of course Stan Lee had one and it was great as all the rest, and the one that's probably the best is a Captain America cameo, I wont tell you when were or how it happens but man it's cool. So in the end Thor: The Dark World is better than the first but this is still a flawed movie, but even with the flaws Thor The Dark World gets an 7.5 out of 10.

","I'm one of the few nerds in this world who wasn't terribly impressed by the first Thor movie. I didn't hate it. I didn't even really dislike it. It was a movie that was just there. A one word rating for it would be meh. When Avengers came out I was pleasantly surprised by how much more entertaining the Thor and Loki characters were. They started to grow on me. While I'm not quite sold on Thor as a stand-alone super hero, I love Loki as a stand-alone villain. I'm going to say it right now and save you some trouble; this movie is very much worth your money! If you stuck around after that last statement, instead of just going out and throwing your money at some teenager with a poor complexion, then let me tell you why this movie is so great. It really breaks down two three things. The first is the Amazing visual effects. Thor: The Dark World is much more in the production style of Avengers, than the first Thor. It had big ambition, big talent, and an even bigger budget. These amazing VFX are only highlighted by some great cinematography, and amazing locations. Iceland (as an alien planet) was the most amazing of them all. The second was the story line. Thor: The Dark World focuses on an agent race of evil elves that are in search of a substance that can destroy all nine realms by throwing them into eternal darkness. While the elves were goofy looking, they made for a formidable foe. I won't lie, the script won't win any awards (except maybe something goofy like an MTV movie award), but it's fun! Fun counts for a lot. The third and final aspect that made this film so great was Tom Hiddleston. The man who plays Loki is an amazing actor, and portrays villianry at near Tim Curry levels. Hiddleston has an amazing career in front of him. Go see ""Thor: The Dark World,"" wait through the credits (there's two stingers), and enjoy the large amounts of fun that is the Marvel universe. You wont regret it, and you'll be prepared for the next Avengers movie. http://watchplayread.com/thor-dark-world-worth-money/",/review/rw2972870/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_The_Dark_World_2013

","The sequence of Thor don't have a plot/screenplay, character's development and universe construction. Not even a good director would save.
I prefer to believe that Yorst hindered the work of Markus and McFeely, because they have a well known comic story to adapt and write the screenplay, but they delivered a story without context, development and sense of logic.
The acting was good, but the construction of the characters over the movie didn't make it possible to understand what was the meaning of that acting. With reservation for the performance of Tom Hiddleston, Rene Russo and Anthony Hopkins that could get up a little bit of political critique, Marvel-standard and strength to the movie.
Alan Taylor is capable of conduct a plot and make some good material of it (as we could see in GoT over the years). So, we can not point fingers if the movie is a failed of screenplay or direction, but the cinematographic environment couldn't be created by the constant breaking of sequences and missing/weak spots.

744,10 April 2014,millmat,7," A worthy, if not slightly weaker installment in the Marvel film franchise.
","""Thor: The Dark World"" is the Marvel film that made me realize the element of the franchise's success. It's the movie's preference to not take themselves too seriously. Sure, there's still good character development and drama, but the movies still know that the premise is nothing that serious, and manages to have fun with itself, and in the process, lets the audience get in on that fun too. They are as much fun too laugh at as they are to be entertained. Despite not reading any of the comics, I liked the first ""Thor"" movie, so I looked forward to seeing this one. This movie takes place in London (a decision I find pointless, but that's just me). Jane Foster, while awaiting the return of Thor, discovers that she's possessed by a mystical element known as the ether. Because of this, a group of dark elves from the titular dark world, are sent out to kidnap Jane and use the ether's power to rule the world. Now it's up to Thor to stop the elves, all the while trying to decide what to do about his brother, Loki. Something I find that the film does a very good job at is telling a three-act story. The first third of the movie reintroduces as to all of our favorite characters, and the dilemmas that they're all facing. None of it is boring, and I was content in seeing where it would be going. Unfortunately, the second act doesn't shine as much. After Thor saves Jane, he takes her back to his home world, Asgard. Here, we take in the lavish art direction by John Bush, almost reminding me of the ""Ave Maria"" sequence from Fantasia. And yet, I still feel bored. This goes on for awhile. It finally starts to pick itself up during a well paced fight scene between the asgardians and the dark elves, and, without giving too much away, someone dies. One of the other characters had previously built up drama between them, leading to some actual drama. And finally, the final act gives us practically what we want. A great final battle, well paced action, and plenty of brushed on humor. ""Thor:The Dark World"" is a worthy, if not weaker, edition of the Marvel film franchise. The plot is very engaging, the comic relief for the most part is very funny, and as always, the action scenes are some of the best I've ever seen.

","Thor: Dark World is a sequel to not only the original Thor but also the Avengers. Thor: Dark World picks up right as avengers finished so Thor is back in Asgard with Loki in tow they imprison him then time passes and Thor has brought order back to the nine realms. But the real story begins when Malekith played by Christopher Eccleston reawakens. They explain his back-story with some quick exposition in the very beginning. He and his ship of dark elves are attempting to awaken and control an ancient artifact so they can plunge the nine realms into eternal darkness. Suffice it to say Thor is not interested in the idea of eternal darkness so he sets about stopping it with the help of an unlikely ally. Now with my assessment of Thor: Dark Worlds Action, Acting, Story, and Visuals. Starting with action now if you have seen the original you know there was minimal action there were about 3-5 action sequences in the whole movie. Thor: Dark World quickly fixes that almost every scene is action packed leading up to a fantastic final fight between Thor and Malekith involving worm holes between the realms. So during the final fight they are tackling and hitting each other through wormholes which was a fantastic way to break up the possible monotony of the standard ""THOR SMASH"" which is pretty hard to avoid when making a movie about a character whose main weapon is a hammer. So the final fight is definitely something to look forward to incredibly enjoyable and surprisingly funny. Next the acting, it was very solid good performances all around although Tom Hiddleston really stole the show as Loki delightfully smarmy and smart-alecky throwing witty verbal barbs at Thor when ever they share the screen. The back and forth between Hemsworth and Hiddleston is incredibly enjoyable. I feel I must commend the writers for almost all the Marvel comic movies they do a fantastic job inject humor into their movies in a way that feels very natural and rather than distracting from the story in fact add another layer. Story wise the movie is torn straight from the marvel comics I am almost 100% sure 90% of the world had no idea who Malekith the Betrayer was before this movie. Yet they did a great job introducing him and he proved a very worthy adversary for the mighty thunder god. The story followed a fairly standard story arc although there were a few I didn't see that coming moments. Visually this film was incredible the special effects are getting so good now days that you rarely see a big movie with sub par effects. OVERALL Action 5 out of 5 Stars Acting 4 ½ out of 5 Stars the half is for Hiddleston Story 3 out of 5 Stars it was pretty standard story line with a few surprises Visuals 4 out of 5 Stars standard visuals good though",/review/rw2972870/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_The_Dark_World_2013

The pairing of Tom and Chris as Loki and Thor is always great viewing and sadly there is not enough funny duo action. It has been noted that the film is a lot shorter than most and a fair few good scenes have not made the final cut, mainly Loki, Loki and Thor and Thor and Frigga.

","Thor: The Dark World is a Marvel action fantasy film that director Allen Taylor takes you on an adventure with the god of thunder to save his beloved, Jane Foster, from the evil that consumes her. Following in the expectations of all Marvel movies, Thor: The Dark World is packed with amazing actors and actresses, a setting that helps you feel as though Asgard is a real place, and a well-developed cast. What more could you ask for? For starters let's talk about the fact that all Marvel movies have these actors that fit each part perfectly. It almost seems like they are all planted in a garden and perfected until it is time for their shot in a movie. For instance Chris Hemsworth, who just happens to be 6'4"" with a godlike body, becomes Thor in the movie. No matter what other character he plays in any other movie, we will forever be known as Thor, the god of thunder. Another example would be Tom Hiddleston, who also just happens to be 6'4 with a villain like persona, transforms into Loki, the god of mischief. These two men will never escape the identity of Thor and Loki, unless they are some other type of species like Anthony Hopkins. When Anthony Hopkins plays a character, you only see him as that one character, during that one movie. During the movie it didn't click in my head that he was Hannibal Lector, all that I saw was Odin. The cast for this movie was unbelievable, not only were the men amazing but the women were fantastic. (Spoiler alert) Kate Dennings plays Darcy Lewis the intern of Jane Foster, who decides she needs an intern herself. Speaking of their relationship Jane decides it's time to start dating, so obviously something would go wrong that Darcy would need to crash her date, eat some of their breadsticks, and convince her to leave.

","Thor 2: The Dark World Director: Alan Taylor Writers: Christopher Yost, Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely, Don Payne, Robert Rodat, Stan Lee, Larry Leiber, and Jack Kirby Cast: Chris Hemsworth (Thor) Natalie Portman (Jane Foster) and Tom Hiddleston (Loki) Rating: 2.5/5 Review: Wow. That was horrible. OK-not horrible but still really bad. Well, plot wise anyway. If you want to look at the portrayal of the female characters, its negative star worthy. So the movie, on the surface, was what I've come to expect these days-meh plot, lots of CGI, a healthy mix of comic relief, and romantic scenes at the wrong times. Female Character Portrayal: GOD WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED HERE. Let's see 1. Jane and Thor make kissy faces at each other the entire time 2. Frigga (Thor's mom) does some cool stuff and dies. Great. Kill off your only strong female character 3. Sif is hardly in it and has little control over the rebellion in the beginning. 4. Darcy is saved by the intern and makes out with him. THIS IS THE MOVIES BIGGEST PROBLEM TO ME. GUESS WHAT DARCY. HE SAVED YOU BECAUSE HE IS A DECENT HUMAN BEING. NOT BECAUSE HE HAS FEELINGS FOR YOU. AND YOU DON'T OWE HIM ANYSORT OF SEXUAL OR ROMANTIC INTERACTION BECAUSE HE SAVED YOU. YOU OWE HIM YOUR THANKS. THAT'S IT. F YOU MARVEL. So the plot: Like I said-meh. Aether is in Jane. Dark Elf guy wants it. Dark Elf guy gets it. There a big battle. The End. You may like this stuff, but I don't. Its formulaic and thus boring, and there is little to no character growth. I found myself so bored that I was discreetly checking Tumblr in the middle of the movie. Then something mildly interesting would happen and I'd start watching the movie again. Then I would get bored and feel the urge to read something. The closest book was These Broken Stars. I would have rather read that then watched a good portion of the movie. And I am NOT a fan of that book. There were a few good scenes and a few misplaced ones. Let's start with the misplaced. The newscast about Erik running around naked. Should have waited to revel that tidbit until the scene were Intern and Darcy found out. I guess Marvel was going for dramatic irony but it would have been a tad bit more suspenseful if we hadn't known. The kissing scene in Asgard. Let's see, the Aether is dangerous, no? Maybe you should work on getting it out and away from the Dark Elf guy instead? Or maybe have a conversation that doesn't end in kissing? I get that they missed each other, but they need to get their priorities straight. OK so now let's cover the good scenes. Far and few between. And usually didn't last for more than a second. The bit about Erik stripping and latter not wearing pants ""because it helps him think"" were funny. And the one where everyone told Loki ""if you betray him I'll kill you"" and then he replied ""Evidently there will be a line"". Then Loki died. Nice and dramatic. Shame he didn't stay dead. As a write this, I hear the future fangirls and fanboys gasping. But Loki! You say. He's misunderstood! Inner pain! His character has depth! No no and no. he is not misunderstood. He does have inner pain but that is no excuse. And yeah depth, but still. Doesn't necessarily make him a good guy. Reasons he is not misunderstood: 1. He consorted with the Frost Giants 2. He killed 80 people in one day 3. Enslaved Hawkeye and several other members of SHIELD 4. Tired to enslave the entire human race. This includes you. And you family and best friends. And probably would have let your pet starve. And this would mean no more Breaking Bad (or whatever show it is you watch) 5. Destroyed a large portion of NYC 6. Made all of Asgard vulnerable to attack from the Dark Elfs. 7. Got his mother killed. (Only person to care about him by the way) 8. Stabbed Thor. This guy is not be trusted. 9. Handed Jane over to the Dark Elfs. 10. He possibly killed Odin. 11. He is now ruling Asgard without anyone knowing what's what. Sounds pretty evil to me. You know what Loki is? A serial killer and a traitor to Asgard. He possibly killed Odin-WHO ADOPTED HIM AND RAISED HIM AS HIS OWN. EVEN THOUGH LOKI IS A FROST GIANT, ONE OF ASGARDS GREATEST ENEMIES . But he had a plan! No he didn't. Five thousand things could have gone wrong and he would simply do whatever he had to in order to survive. He doesn't care about anyone except his mother. And she's dead thanks to him. (Actually, I don't think he cares about his mother. It was for some sick emotional appeal) Nothing excuses what he has done. Nothing. The plot twist with Odin was just random. WTF? How? How did he survive? Doesn't matter. He manipulated Thor and will likely manipulate everyone else in the next movie. Loki is a bad guy.",/review/rw2972870/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_The_Dark_World_2013

Would the protection of their Queen be so lame? I don't get it.

","Thor: The Dark World, is one of the best 2013 Marvel movies. It gives you smiles, tears, & jaw dropping moments. If you love Marvel movies & have not seen this movie I recommend seeing it. No spoilers here, so it's 10 out of 10 for me. I loved it and all of the other Avenger movies. I hope you like this review and enjoy every MARVEL movie out there like me. Not all MARVEL suck. They have gotten better over the past years. I don't see why you wouldn't want to waste you money on this movie. Iron Man, The Hulk, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow & Hawkeye are for sure the best MARVEL heroes out there. You can for sure trust me on that. :)",/review/rw2972870/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_The_Dark_World_2013
824,2 March 2014,AllanCompressor,8," Another fantasy/sci-Fi film exceeding reviews
","This film falls into the class of fantasy/sci-films FAR better than critics would lead you to believe. This is far more ambitious than the original Thor, with a far more clever script. Tom Hiddleston can always be relied upon for solid villainy; he is appropriately used. Christopher Eccleston is a well known British actor who has impressed me in everything he has done since Shekhar Kapur's Elizabeth. The dynamic between Thor and Jane Foster is less interesting than between Thor and Loki. The whole plot about how dark elves are trying to commandeer this protean ""Aether"" to somehow re-immerse the universe into ""dark matter"" probably had actual experts like Sean Carroll rolling their eyes. But who cares? A British stage actor plays a bad guy trying to destroy the universe, while the good guys try and stop him. This is a solid escapist film with lots of good actors having fun, and more than a fair share of witty moments. This film could have probably fallen short with inferior editing. I feel this stands as a legit film independent of the Avengers' juggernaut. Two other fantasy/sci-fi films also, IMHO, which far better then critical reviews were the Hobbit (lots of a abuse: why??) and, surprisingly, Oblivion. I finished this film very pleasantly surprised with how well it worked.",/review/rw2972870/?ref_=tt_urv,Thor_The_Dark_World_2013
