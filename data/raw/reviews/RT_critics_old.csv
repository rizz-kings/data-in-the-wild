ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Jeffrey Peterson,False,"Sep 7, 2023","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a film that also manages to balance VFX spectacle and groundedness in its third act. And although the conclusion feels slightly rushed, the ending is better than that of many MCU films we’ve seen lately."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Lee Zumpe,False,"Aug 23, 2023","It may feel like the director ordered a truckload of kitchen sinks to throw into this chaotic, complicated-yet-dumb, serious-yet-silly, imperfect extravaganza, but he still manages to serve up an astonishing tale."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Cris Parker,False,"Aug 16, 2023",While I still like the film overall. Every MCU movie now just becoming setup for the next is making characters like Ant-Man lose some of their charm.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Sarah Vincent,True,"Aug 16, 2023","the two-dimensional supporting characters and bloated, derivative universe-building feel like pink filler for too long before flashbacks reveal Janet and Kang’s time together and give us some pique of interest."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Rick Bentley,True,"Aug 9, 2023",The errors are easy to miss because the script and all of the acting performances are drenched in a goop of CGI characters that obliterate everything in their path.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Manuel São Bento,True,"Jul 25, 2023","Excessive, repetitive, unnecessary dialogue driven by exposition, along with a lack of stronger tonal balance and an underdeveloped narrative devoid of true stakes - character arcs are almost non-existent - make this an overall very inconsistent watch."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Matthew Creith,True,"Jul 25, 2023",This is yet another Marvel movie where the tired trope makes its way into driving the plot: A character does something foolish which creates havoc for their world while most of the original cast is separated from one another the bulk of the time.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Hector A. Gonzalez,True,"Jul 25, 2023","For most of its run-time, it feels like a filler episode of an anime, with only its climax operating as a narrative “threshold”."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Zach Pope,True,"Jul 25, 2023","Ant Man And The Wasp Quantumania  The film’s first act kicks off as a badass Star Wars Adventure BUT slowly tires out towards the middle. Fun? Absolutely! Exposition heavy? Yes!
A mixed bag overall"
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Pramit Chatterjee,True,"Jul 23, 2023",Marvel isn’t in the business of telling stories. They are in the business of selling action figures. That’s why you have so many characters wearing brand-new but hideous-looking costumes frolicking around to pad the runtime.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Brooke Obie,False,"Jul 20, 2023",Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a good time.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Chris McCoy,True,"Jul 12, 2023",This movie looks bad.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Mattie Lucas,True,"Jul 5, 2023","Everything about it is phony and flat from the start, visually unappealing and narratively aimless."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Charles Holmes,True,"Jun 27, 2023",The supposedly limitless storytelling device has been pushed to its narrative limits. Just look to Quantumania for proof.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Victor Pineyro,True,"Jun 24, 2023",Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror is almost the only great thing about this quasi-animated film that was supposed to bring life to a most expected quantum realm. [Full review in Spanish]
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Matthew Pejkovic,False,"Jun 16, 2023",Creative world building and a compelling villain performance from Jonathan Majors helps 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania' deliver as a solid superhero movie.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Pete Vonder Haar,True,"Jun 2, 2023","Like it or not, this is the ouroboros the Marvel Cinematic Universe has become. Kang's backstory may be a little more convoluted than Thanos's, but in the end he also just wants to ""burn the broken worlds"" to create a better one."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Matt Brunson,True,"May 31, 2023","The Marvel Cinematic Universe’s Phase Ho-Hum ended with the release of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, and Phase Shoulder Shrug kicks off with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Justin Brown,True,"May 28, 2023","This feels like a ""stepping stone"" film that came off like a ""Star Wars"" rip-off. This didn't move the needle for the MCU or these characters."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Brandon Collins,True,"May 28, 2023",I wasn't a big fan of this movie and some of the performances. I was surprised with how low the stakes in this story were. Kang was wasted and Michael Pena was greatly missed.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,David Hogan,True,"May 23, 2023","While it had some pleasing visuals and some strong performances from Paul Rudd and others Quantumania still managed to fall flat. It’s not a bad film, it’s not a good film, it’s firmly in the extremely mundane middle…"
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Eddie Harrison,True,"May 22, 2023","…this film’s action sorely lacks the ingenious charm offered by the super-scale skirmishes seen in the first two Ant-Man films, and the result is incomprehensible gibberish…"
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Kip Mooney,True,"May 20, 2023",All you’ll find is another building block of content that will come out quarterly but leave no lasting impression.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Jared Mobarak,False,"May 19, 2023",It's a two-hour-long computer-generated video game that stays afloat because of two things: Rudd's comic timing and Majors' acting clinic.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Allison Rose,False,"May 17, 2023","Visually, Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania is incredible, with precise details and colors exploding everywhere on screen."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Susan Granger,True,"May 3, 2023",Be thankful you didn't squander your money at the box-office! This atrocious escapade is one of the most worthless entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Sean P. Means,False,"Apr 23, 2023","Appropriately for the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s tiniest heroes, the charms of “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” are small, but still satisfying,"
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,John Serba,True,"Apr 19, 2023","The general color-drenched too-muchness of it all might be tolerable if the plot wasn’t such a by-the-numbers slog, alternating hyperkinetic action sequences with draggy recitations of exposition."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Michael Ward,True,"Apr 16, 2023",...this trip into Quantumania is a missed opportunity.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Nathaniel Rogers,True,"Mar 24, 2023","Most unfortunate of all, the usually reliable Paul Rudd coasts through this one, wearing his charisma like an old shirt that he forgot to wash and iron before putting on, assuming we'd just love seeing it (and him) again."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Eric Webb,False,"Mar 20, 2023",Quantumania has the goods. It lets Majors take new big bad Kang out for a joyride without feeling like he’s just slumming it in an Ant-Man picture.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,MontiLee Stormer,False,"Mar 18, 2023","The MCU spent Phase 4 showing a sprawling universe at some point, they’re all going to have to come together to beat the crap out of each other. We’ve got a whole multiverse to sit down to, so let Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania be that appetizer."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Stacey Yvonne,False,"Mar 17, 2023",I love Marvel and understand the implications the film is supposed to have as it ushers in Phase 5. What I’m at a loss to understand is just why this task was laid at the feet of Ant-Man.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Bruce R. Miller,True,"Mar 15, 2023","Because audiences warm to Paul Rudd’s humor, his third stand-alone Ant-Man outing should have gone for the laughs, not some convoluted mythology that explains nothing."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Brian Gill,False,"Mar 14, 2023","Far from the best the MCU has to offer but fun, energetic, and quirky enough to overlook its flaws. Also: Jonathan Majors."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Dan Tabor,True,"Mar 13, 2023","While Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania’s overwhelming onslaught of half baked CGI and hamfisted performances may be the bulk of the film’s over two hour runtime, one performer who isn’t sleepwalking to his payday is Jonathan Majors."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Victoria Alexander,True,"Mar 8, 2023",A disastrous mess with the Ant population expanding. Even the family gardener has a suit which means Scott Lang’s role is reduced to carrying everybody’s luggage.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Kristen Maldonado,True,"Mar 8, 2023","You have a great cast that gets lost in an overstuffed story. There's no emotional connections, so many of the characters just didn't get enough screen time, and the goals of what they're setting up with Kang feel too abstract."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Tim Brayton,True,"Mar 4, 2023",I cannot imagine ranking it anywhere other than dead last out of the 31 features presently constituting the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Ineye Komonibo,True,"Mar 3, 2023",Clumsy storytelling and underdeveloped characters unfortunately prevented it from being the spectacular strong start that Phase 5 needed it to be.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Piers Marchant,True,"Mar 3, 2023","Quantumania is a lifeless, mirthless CGI saturnalia that dispenses almost entirely with the emotional core of its characters. In its place, Peyton Reed and his production team have resorted to the worst sort of empty spectacle filmmaking."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Sameen Amer,True,"Mar 2, 2023","The whole thing seems to be built almost entirely on cliches and tropes, with no gravity, no sense of impact or consequence."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Frantz Jerome,False,"Mar 2, 2023","As a standalone movie, it falls squarely right in the center of worth it and not worth it to see in theaters."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Edward Porter,True,"Mar 2, 2023","Despite a smattering of jokes, Peyton Reed’s film just isn’t as much fun as the others."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Jay Horton,True,"Mar 2, 2023",With very small powers come no real responsibilities.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Joel Harley,True,"Mar 1, 2023",Not even Rudd’s effortless charisma can save the characters from feeling lost against a background of grey-brown sludge and unremarkable landscaping.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,tt stern-enzi,False,"Mar 1, 2023","I liked this film a lot, the fun and the humor are still there, but the stakes are definitively raised."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Cris Kennedy,False,"Mar 1, 2023","... While the film has a bunch of things to pick apart, it's aesthetic and visual enjoyability isn't one of them."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Vera Wylde,False,"Feb 28, 2023","I thought this was fun, entertaining, visually interesting, the characters worked well, and the villain is spot on. Is it amazing? Is it top tier? No, I don't think it was ever going to be. But I don't regret my time with it."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Lael Loewenstein,True,"Feb 28, 2023",[Jonathan Majors] elevated the material and was in a realm altogether... [But the movie] was too drunk on its own mythology.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Tim Cogshell,False,"Feb 28, 2023","Jonathan Majors is just outstanding. He's in a different movie, giving a Shakespearean performance in what is otherwise... well, it's Ant-Man."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Susan Kamyab,False,"Feb 27, 2023","""Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania"" is going to be lower on the MCU movie list. But, with its thrilling action sequences and funny one liners, this sequel makes for an enjoyable 
blockbuster that's worth catching on the big screen."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Sheraz Farooqi,True,"Feb 27, 2023","ANT-MAN & THE WASP: Quantumania feels more like a Disney+ special than a film.

It’s messy, overindulgent on weak CGI, and humor falls flat. Jonathan Majors is great as Kang but Marvel seemed more focused on creating a 2-hour trailer for something better."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Matt Neal,False,"Feb 27, 2023","Quantumania swings big, but forgets the small stuff, to its own detriment."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Jackie K. Cooper,True,"Feb 25, 2023",A movie about Ant-Man & Wasp would do well to focus on Ant-Man & Wasp.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,J. Don Birnam,True,"Feb 25, 2023","In a universe with 20+ films, one of them has to be the worst, and Quantamania is a strong contender for that inauspicious title, lacking any emotional mooring or reason to care whatsoever"
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Sarah Marrs,True,"Feb 25, 2023","Ant-Man is for wacky capers and comic relief in Avengers movies, not exposition-heavy narrative centerpieces responsible for setting up the next three years of cinematic storytelling."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Joe Friar,True,"Feb 25, 2023","31 films deep in the MCU means there are bound to be a few duds. The barrage of overblown effects and a story devoid of emotion makes this entry a bottom dweller. The good news, Phase 5 can only get better."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Sarah Ward,True,"Feb 24, 2023","Anyone who fears that too many blockbusters are becoming too similar won't feel fortunate while watching... The MCU is going massive on Kang, patently; if only it'd kept the Ant-Man pictures small."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Paul Salfen,False,"Feb 24, 2023","More sci-fi than superhero flick this time, taking cues from Star Wars and gets really fantastical. While it may not be the best in the series, it's a totally fun installment and one that's worth seeing on the big screen."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Rich Cline,False,"Feb 24, 2023","All of this makes the plot feel both murky and corny, while the action is less than convincing. Still, the cast is on fine form, finding moments of emotion alongside the snarky relationship humour."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Emmanuel Báez,True,"Feb 24, 2023",A prologue that desperately seeks to make the irrelevant relevant. [Full review in Spanish]
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Candice McMillan,True,"Feb 24, 2023","The Quantum Realm is strikingly similar to that other space movie, if not a chintzy reproduction whose heavy CGI work is like lipstick on a space boar."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Jim Judy,True,"Feb 24, 2023","I can't remember ever wanting to walk out during a press screening of any post-2008 Marvel movie, but I had the urge this time around and wouldn't have missed much had I followed that impulse."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,M.N. Miller,False,"Feb 24, 2023","Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania is pure, indulgent escapism that never forgets comic book movies are supposed to be fun."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Alistair Harkness,True,"Feb 24, 2023","The ensuing plot is mostly gibberish, full of universe-threatening stakes that are too easily overcome."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,JD Duran,False,"Feb 24, 2023","After three movies, and a couple of Avengers appearances, we finally get a Scott and Cassie movie."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Sandie Angulo Chen,False,"Feb 24, 2023","Is it worth watching this to keep up with the MCU? Sure. It's hard not to root for the ""little guy."" But this movie is ""just fine"" instead of particularly funny, thrilling, or memorable."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,John Urbancich,True,"Feb 23, 2023",Crawls instead of buzzes.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Jake Wilson,True,"Feb 23, 2023","The more appealing thing about the whole enterprise is the mental image of these former A-listers hanging out between takes, swapping stories of the old days and competing over who least understands the script."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Terence Johnson,True,"Feb 23, 2023","By virtue of placing a character that is nearly street level with a universe threatening opponent, you have to make the movie rise to meet it. However Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is largely stuck in needing to be bigger."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Micheal Compton,False,"Feb 23, 2023","Portrayed by Jonathan Majors, Kang is an intense menacing presence who gives the MCU the jolt it has sorely needed since Avengers: End Game."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Erik Kain,False,"Feb 23, 2023","nt-Man 3 is a fun if predictable superhero movie that gets a few big things wrong, but bounces back on the strength of its leads, with both Paul Rudd and Jonathan Majors knocking it out of the park."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Kenneth R. Morefield,False,"Feb 23, 2023",A return to what Marvel does best ... teasing the next movie.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Chris Wasser,True,"Feb 23, 2023","Rarely has a film about a family in peril been so utterly devoid of suspense. The problem, it seems, is that Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania exists as part of a larger enterprise."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Josh Rosenberg,True,"Feb 23, 2023",One good scene can't fix a film overloaded with so much plot -- and so many characters -- that you'll actually wish everyone slowed down to tell their corny jokes.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Dwight Brown,True,"Feb 23, 2023",The thrill is gone. The Marvel Universe shoots a blank. A tiny one.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Matthew Turner,False,"Feb 23, 2023","The stand-out element is Majors, whose unsettlingly cool, calm and collected performance as Kang will have you eagerly anticipating his next MCU appearance."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Nick Johnston,False,"Feb 23, 2023","As another Merry Marvel Continuity Exercise, it could be a lot worse. At least they have a compellingly-acted villain again, even if they aren’t quite sure what to do with him on the way to their destination."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Alejandra Martinez,True,"Feb 23, 2023","'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania' is the weirdest, most fun movie of the three. Yet, it's bogged down by serving as another stepping stone on the road to Marvel's Multiverse Saga."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Rene Sanchez,False,"Feb 23, 2023","An uneven mix of comedy and action that lacks epicness, but thrives on introducing a dangerous new villain. [Full Review in Spanish]"
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Erin Maxwell,True,"Feb 23, 2023","The film covers no new ground, offers no new concepts. and introduces almost nothing fresh in the way of storytelling or character development. Rudd and Reed made a solid duo in the past, but this time around the formula stands out more than the charm."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Mark Jackson,True,"Feb 22, 2023",It's nice Hollywood's been scouring metaphysical and cosmological texts and translating them into comic book popcorn entertainment (The Quantum Realm!) but the over-usage of CGI as a lazy replacement for the craft of good storytelling is tedious.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,TK Burton,False,"Feb 22, 2023","There are some truly fun pieces to it, some genuinely inventive and impressive visuals, and a mostly likable cast. But it doesn’t do enough to separate itself from the blurred, messy palette that the MCU has become to truly stand out. It’s… fine."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Nick Hasted,False,"Feb 22, 2023","Tentatively pushing into broader fantasy cinema, it retains frissons for those of us who did grow up having our imaginations blown open by Jack Kirby."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Robert Roten,False,"Feb 22, 2023","As far as superhero action movies go, this one works well enough. There is plenty of action and plenty of imaginative eye candy. The acting is good. The soundtrack is also solid. It should prove to be a popular addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Kevin Carr,False,"Feb 22, 2023","It suffers from some script problems in the first half, but it ultimately delivers a bonkers but exciting gateway to the next Marvel phase."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Thelma Adams,False,"Feb 22, 2023","The visuals are so busy, the jokes so tame, the homilies so overfamiliar, the only option is surrendering to the chaos. But those pros Pfeiffer and Douglas up the game with an interstellar Romancing the Stone vibe."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Courtney Lanning,True,"Feb 22, 2023",The lackluster writing and typical Marvel clichés don't allow for Rudd's effortless charm to carry the character.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,John Rocha,False,"Feb 22, 2023","Thoroughly enjoyed Ant Man And The Wasp: Quantumania. Jonathan Majors is a superstar with Michelle Pfeiffer matching him beat for beat. The world building of the Quantum Realm is stunning. It has the right mix of humor, emotional stakes, action, and awe."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Ruben Peralta Rigaud,True,"Feb 22, 2023",Talent can't hide the fact that the movie gets less and less interesting as it progresses.  [Full review in Spanish]

ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Annie Banks,True,"Feb 21, 2023","While an ant can lift  5,000 times its own body weight, there's little to support here."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Mihir Bhanage,False,"Feb 21, 2023","Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania takes you on a fun adventure. And, as always, stay back for Easter eggs in the mid and post credit scenes."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Jason Shawhan,True,"Feb 21, 2023","This film is silly and messy and pretty and trippy, and though it fulfills the obligations of vweepy laser fights, digital everything, and several different varieties of product placement, it’s not going to reshape the marketplace."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Joseph Garcia,False,"Feb 21, 2023","One of Marvel's most visually inventive films with fantastical world-building, and the franchise's most imposing villain yet in Kang the Conqueror."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Tim Brennan,False,"Feb 21, 2023","Nearly immediately, director Peyton Reed stomps on the gas, plunging our itsy-bitsy heroes into chases, fistfights, battle sequences and other assorted setpieces."

ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Carla Renata,False,"Feb 21, 2023",The real badass presence of Jonathan Majors  and Michelle Pfeiffer going toe to toe in the mulitverse will keep audiences on their toes and salivating for more.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Cody Leach,False,"Feb 20, 2023",Quantumania maintains the quirky fun of the Ant-Man movies and is a great introduction to Kang but it struggles with massively combating tones. It's solid entertainment but the MCU bag of tricks have become redundant and exhausting.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Rosa Parra,True,"Feb 20, 2023",“Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is a visual exposition filled with childish jokes and underwritten characters. Phase Five has me asking why I should root for the little guy when there’s a titan like Majors portraying Kang.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Wenlei Ma,False,"Feb 20, 2023","A superhero epic of gargantuan proportions that overwhelms and overstimulates, but still manages to deliver some human emotions despite the CGI circus."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,James Berardinelli,False,"Feb 20, 2023","The overall narrative is pedestrian but offers enough flashes, bangs, and general weirdness for those who prefer to sit back and absorb such things."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Gabi Zietsman,True,"Feb 20, 2023","On the whole, Quantamania lacked heart because the actors didn't really have anything to work with, and it felt like Disney/Marvel didn't really care about the film at all."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Tim Grierson,False,"Feb 20, 2023","""Quantumania"" has greater stakes and a grander canvas than the more lighthearted previous chapters of the Ant-Man saga, and the film mostly negotiates the tricky tonal shift -- even if the results are more predictable than spectacular."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Patrick Hicks,False,"Feb 20, 2023","QUANTUMANIA takes the us deep into a micro-verse in this action-adventure space opera, introducing us to a strange new world and bringing a new big bad to the MCU, while reminding us all that it's never too late to stop being a dick."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Matt Hudson,True,"Feb 19, 2023","After an encouraging start, Quantumania succumbs to mediocrity when it had the chance to propel the MCU forward effectively. Jonathan Majors is great, but the movie is anything but."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Stephen Silver,True,"Feb 19, 2023","A dire and crummy movie, one of the worst ever produced by Marvel."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Dan Buffa,True,"Feb 19, 2023","Part 3 plugs all of it back into Feige and company’s plan, an increasingly bland one. Maybe it’s Marvel fatigue or a simple case of sequelitis, but the magic in these films has ceased to exist."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Cory Woodroof,True,"Feb 19, 2023","It feels like Marvel is starting to spin its wheels a bit, with this Ant-Man movie a weird blend of refried Guardians of the Galaxy and a far-less interesting extension of what Loki was doing with all the multiverse hubbub."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Rendy Jones,True,"Feb 19, 2023","That’s what I like about these Marvel films, man. I get older, and they stay the same."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Wendy Ide,True,"Feb 19, 2023","The film’s main asset is Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror: his performance, with its velvet-soft line deliveries and unfathomable, boundless rage, is the magnetic core of this incoherent effects-dump of a movie."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Víctor López G.,False,"Feb 19, 2023","Without, apparently, greater airs than entertain and offer a different experience within the recen moth-eaten offer of Marvel Studios, 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania' sets a fantastic start for the Phase 5."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Adam Olinger,True,"Feb 19, 2023","There is a universe out there where Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a good movie.
It ain't this one."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Mel Valentin,False,"Feb 18, 2023","Undermined like too many recent MCU entries by murky, muddy visuals ... an under-motivated, underdeveloped super-villain, a script light on humour and long on family drama, [the film] at least benefits from an unsurprisingly strong cast"
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Dustin Chase,True,"Feb 18, 2023","Nothing more than a desperate money grab for Marvel, overplaying an already weak minor character, to bide time for the next phase."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Akhil Arora,True,"Feb 18, 2023",Jonathan Majors is great but his Kang—the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s next big bad—suffers in a film that looks fake and struggles to sketch an arc for its growing ensemble.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Ruth Maramis,True,"Feb 18, 2023","Despite strong performances from the cast, 'Quantumania' is dull and exhausting to sit through. Marvel’s glory days might be behind us and I’m really not looking forward to the rest of Phase Five."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Matthew Lickona,True,"Feb 18, 2023","And yet, there it was, that thought, overarching and overwhelming: “I didn’t feel a thing.”"
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Sara Michelle Fetters,True,"Feb 18, 2023","Ant-Man’s return is notable for the villain and not a lot more, meaning this sequel shrinks into the back of the memory rather quickly, disappearing into the multiversal content void almost as if it never existed in the first place."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Mark McPherson,False,"Feb 18, 2023","Despite an uneven tone, Quantumania mostly works as an enticing superhero adventure, despite how hard it veers away from Ant-Man’s previously zippy nature."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Christopher Machell,False,"Feb 18, 2023",Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania may be lacking in any discernible drama or emotional stakes but it is easily one of the most solidly entertaining and spectacular of Marvel’s ‘Phase 4’ run of of film and TV.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,David Lynch,True,"Feb 18, 2023","It’s a troubling thing for a franchise to be this much at an impasse when everyone involved insists, fingers apparently crossed behind their backs, that they’re finally forging ahead."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Doug Walker,True,"Feb 18, 2023","The world is an amazing spectacle, but the writing feels 20 years old."

ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Nicole Ackman,True,"Feb 18, 2023","Despite a nice family dynamic between the Langs and Pyms, the lack of clarity around new villain Kang and the subpar visual effects make the film a lackluster addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Valerie Kalfrin,False,"Feb 17, 2023","ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA leaves some unanswered questions, and its action scenes rely more on fisticuffs than clever size-shifting props and fight choreography. It’s still a fun outing with likable characters, just not a fantastic voyage."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Rick Marshall,False,"Feb 17, 2023","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania opens up another new, wonderfully weird avenue for adventures in the MCU, but the film’s ambition occasionally outpaces an otherwise fun cast and the intriguing concepts it teases."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Jeffrey Lyles,False,"Feb 17, 2023","A solid film that happens to have Ant-Man and The Wasp in it as opposed to being a good Ant-Man and The Wasp film, but it does provide a course correct of sorts while providing needed focus to the saga’s ultimate threat."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Joe Lipsett,False,"Feb 17, 2023",Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a solid mid-tier MCU entry. One simply wishes that the film didn’t exist principally to set-up the villain/conflict for the rest of the Phase 5. Did we really need a two hour film just to introduce Kang?
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,M.V. Moorhead,False,"Feb 17, 2023","The visuals, however derivative, are elegant, witty and well-executed, and the glamorous cast is in pleasant form. Rudd's sly, subtle clowning is always good company, and he carries the movie effortlessly."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Ray Pride,True,"Feb 17, 2023","Another drab apocalypse, but with charming fellow passengers to pass the time in charming fashion as noxious clouds swirl, and dim tapestry keeps unfurling in lieu of landscape... the slurry of action is just more Marvel mayhem."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Mike McGranaghan,True,"Feb 17, 2023",Ant-Man and the Wasp is two hours of the last 20 minutes of most Marvel movies. Even viewers who haven’t experienced MCU fatigue may find themselves feeling it this time.

ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Erik Childress,True,"Feb 17, 2023",The Ant-Man films have been a palette cleanser for audiences involved in the Marvel Universe.

ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Devesh Sharma,False,"Feb 17, 2023",The film is strictly made for die-hard Marvel and Ant-Man fans. Watch it for its special effects and imaginatively constructed landscape and creatures. Don’t go looking for drama and you won’t be disappointed.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Stephen Romei,True,"Feb 17, 2023","Some of the Marvel (and DC) franchises do feel a bit past their use-by date. “It’s never over,” Kang says at one point. He speaks the truth, for better or worse."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Vincent Mancini,True,"Feb 17, 2023","The MCU has become an emotional Ponzi Scheme. You're expected to watch not because this will make you feel something today, but in the hopes that this continuity will matter somewhere down the line."

ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Tatat Bunnag,True,"Feb 17, 2023","The dialogue and the screenplay are some of the worst I've experienced recently from an MCU film. However, once Jonathan Majors's character Kang comes into the play during the third act, things get slightly more interesting."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Aniruddho Chakraborty,False,"Feb 17, 2023","It may seem that Quantumania loses some of its soul by serving the multiverse saga set up for the MCU, which we saw happen with Iron Man 2. However, the film is still a great one-time, big-screen watch..."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Lisa Johnson Mandell,True,"Feb 17, 2023",This is the film that's supposed to usher in the next phase in the Marvel Universe? It's a weak attempt to establish Kang the Conquerer (Jonathan Majors) as the next super villain of Thanos-sized proportions. Kang (and Majors) deserve a better launch.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Chris Joyce,False,"Feb 17, 2023","While the story isn’t as compelling as it could be, thanks in part to some choppiness of the narrative, the overall arcs are engaging and this really sets up a villain who’s a powerful threat."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Ryan Syrek,False,"Feb 17, 2023",Nothing in “Quantumania” is outright bad. I’d watch it a hundred thousand times before watching “Avatar 2” ever again. Nobody tell James Cameron I said that. He’s got “Make that guy disappear” money for sure now...

ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Eli Glasner,True,"Feb 17, 2023","This is the Marvel way: The studio recruits actors and directors for their distinctive qualities, but over time the thing that stuck out  gets filed down, until they're just part of the machine.  Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is more of the same."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Abbie Bernstein,False,"Feb 17, 2023",A mostly fun journey into the tiny-verse.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Ian Thomas Malone,True,"Feb 17, 2023","Quantumania represents an embarrassing low point for the MCU, a soulless cash-grab that debases the very idea of cinema itself.

ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Radheyan Simonpillai,False,"Feb 17, 2023",Jonathan Majors is giving an emotionally acrobatic performance that this franchise does not deserve.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Christopher Lloyd,False,"Feb 17, 2023","The storytelling's a bit unmoored, but Paul Rudd shines in a colorful cantina of weird alien creatures and Jonathan Majors gives a charismatic pathos to Kang the Conqueror.

ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Keith Garlington,True,"Feb 17, 2023",This is another entry that fails to muster excitement or move things forward in a meaningful way. It just exists – a gear in a moneymaking machine that is starting to lose its steam.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Andy Lea,True,"Feb 17, 2023",There are some zippy set pieces where our heroes use their size-shifting suits to bat away Kang’s brittle stormtroopers. But the plot is formulaic and the dialogue largely witless... I’ll probably remember this as “the Baskin-Robbins One”.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Kevin A. Ranson,False,"Feb 17, 2023","Marvel’s “Rick and Morty”... no longer intended for the casual moviegoer... the MCU demands you keep up... Edited to the bone to avoid Eternals-like running time and over-exposition, Quantumania comes up short in emotion and extreme for spectacle."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Jeff Mitchell,True,"Feb 17, 2023","It’s ‘Quantumania’ not The Who’s ‘Quadrophenia’.  Although after watching this film, two tracks from a different album come to mind: ‘Won’t Get Fooled Again’ and ‘Baba O’Riley’."

ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Maggie Lovitt,False,"Feb 17, 2023","One of the best MCU films in recent history because it doesn’t take itself so seriously. It delivers fun, light-hearted, and sometimes juvenile humor all the while delivering weighty plotlines and exceptional performances."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Michael Burgin,True,"Feb 17, 2023",Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania feels less like it’s a small part of a bigger plan and more as if it’s being forced to work against its own interests to serve a grand design.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Ryan Silberstein,False,"Feb 17, 2023","Quantumania feels like pulling a random comic book from a box and going along for the ride. It’s not pushing the form further or playing with genre, but it is a fun adventure with great characters."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Felix Vasquez Jr.,False,"Feb 17, 2023","I quite enjoyed the absolutely phantasmagorical action of “Quantumania,” but like “Iron Man 2,” it would work so much better if it didn’t feel like a simple buffer before we get to the more urgent affairs with the Avengers."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Johnny Gayzmonic,True,"Feb 17, 2023","When all was said and done, I walked away feeling unsatisfied...If not for a dedicated and highly professional cast, it’s possible this film may have gotten lost inside the relentless cogs of the MCU machine."

ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Josh Wilding,False,"Feb 17, 2023","Despite being an example of why a movie shouldn’t be shot almost entirely in The Volume, every time Jonathan Majors steps on screen as Kang, Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania is an epic tale to astonish and a monumental chapter in the Multiverse Saga."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Peter Travers,True,"Feb 17, 2023","The once playful runt of the Marvel litter has come down with a case of bloated excess and despite likable Paul Rudd as Ant-Man and a pow villain in Jonathan Majors, the third time is not the charm for a sequel that ignores its own rule -- less is more."

ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Nell Minow,False,"Feb 17, 2023","The title says it all because the story is more about the place than about what happens there.

ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Richard Crouse,True,"Feb 16, 2023","Rudd’s charisma brings a lightness of touch, and he provides some genuinely funny moments in the film.

ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Jordan Hoffman,True,"Feb 16, 2023",The movie winds up being confusing (a sin) and dull (a bigger sin.)
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Chase Hutchinson,True,"Feb 16, 2023","The only part of Quantumania that is memorable is Majors who, without spoiling, will likely have more of a role in future films to come. One just hopes they're better than this one."

ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Brandon Avery,False,"Feb 16, 2023","The Ant-Man films are always funny, but Marvel often feels it's necessary to throw in random forced jokes during the most serious moments, which nearly kills the third act.

ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Korey Coleman,True,"Feb 16, 2023",Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania feels like it's trying to be a Marvel movie. The jokes are played up too much. Not everything needs to be funny.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Jorge Rivera Rubio,True,"Feb 16, 2023","Trying to be many things; a movie about family, an explosive start to Phase 5 and the arrival of its great villain, it achieves little of all that, because its tone varies too widely between dense, weird and messy.

ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Jack King,True,"Feb 15, 2023","To introduce Kang, really, is all Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania exists to do. In and of itself, it's a boring story devoid of meaningful stakes."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Kristian M. Lin,True,"Feb 15, 2023","This movie wants to give Scott more dramatic weight, but the thematic heaviness doesn’t suit the series or director Peyton Reed.

ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Adam Graham,True,"Feb 15, 2023","Everything besides the introduction of Kang feels perfunctory, and an MCU entry (this is No. 31, if you're keeping score) has never felt so rudderless."

ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Jason Escamilla,True,"Feb 15, 2023","After a promising first act that featured some relatable family conflict, the film falls apart by dividing our characters up in a contrived and inconsequential realm that had absent thrills and jokes that didn’t land."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,John Lui,True,"Feb 15, 2023","The Quantum Realm offers dazzling eye candy, but the novelty does not last. And the lack of freshness continues with a threadbare plot that tries to distract from the fact this film exists mainly to introduce a new Marvel movie phase."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,John Wenzel,True,"Feb 15, 2023","There's so much to sift through and occasionally like: a visually inspired subatomic set piece, bits of the roiling family tension among actors who are much better than their scripts.

ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Doug Jamieson,True,"Feb 15, 2023","While there's a kooky, psychedelic feel that echoes Star Wars and Guardians of the Galaxy, it falls under the weight of its own ambition and loses sight of what made its two predecessors so breezily enjoyable."

ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Carson Timar,True,"Feb 15, 2023",Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania starts Phase 5 off with a flop as a dull story and questionable execution causes the film to be a wildly worthless miss.

ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Dave Lee,True,"Feb 14, 2023","A big, dumb blockbuster that can't decide whether it's a crazy comedy or a gritty drama.

ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Robert Kojder,True,"Feb 14, 2023","Jonathan Majors should be referred to as “the defibrillator” because his intense performance gives the film desperately needed life. But the film is still unsatisfying, emotionally thin, and inconsequential"
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,JimmyO,False,"Feb 14, 2023","Funny, heartfelt, and exciting, and the villain is a worthy foe. Pfieffer and Majors shine.

ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,David Fear,True,"Feb 14, 2023","Quantumania is somehow heavy without feeling substantial, almost desperate in its dourness. Even scattered with occasional wisecracks, it makes Eternals feel positively breezy by comparison."

ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Lupe Rodriguez Haas,False,"Feb 14, 2023",The third installment is the busiest movie of this Marvel trilogy with tons of distracting CGI environments.

ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Brian Lowry,True,"Feb 14, 2023","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania works on one key level, establishing Kang the Conqueror as a truly formidable and worthy villain.

ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Lindsey Bahr,True,"Feb 14, 2023","Majors is certainly chilling and captivating, but Kang seems like a mismatched foe for a standalone Ant-Man film and the result is a Quantumania that is trying to be too many things."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Rachel Leishman,False,"Feb 14, 2023","Quantumania, as a whole, is a solid third movie in Scott’s franchise and a nod to relationships and science, and brings us a fresh take on his daughter, Cassie Lang."

ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,A.A. Dowd,True,"Feb 14, 2023","Quantumania is proof, if we still needed it, that bigger isn't always better. In growing to typical Marvel size, it shrinks away the fun."
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Austin Burke,False,"Feb 14, 2023","Quantumania starts out on a messy note. The story and VFX are all over the place until Kang enters the picture.

ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Carla Hay,True,"Feb 14, 2023",It's a quantum mess. It’s bad enough that it recycles tired clichés of Marvel movies. This uneven superhero movie also rips off 1977’s Star Wars in many ways. Jonathan Majors’ standout performance can’t save this substandard spectacle.
ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,DarkSkyLady,False,"Feb 14, 2023","Though the stakes feel lackluster, and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania trudges along at times rather than galloping at a clip, Marvel’s goodwill might make the film worthwhile."

ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania,Fico Cangiano,False,"Feb 14, 2023","The best entry of the trilogy. Higher stakes, dangers and repercussions within the trippy Quantum Realm and for the rest of the MCU. Jonathan Majors is fantastic as Kang, the next big villain for Marvel. [Full review in Spanish]"

ant-man-and-the-wasp,Khal Davenport,False,"Apr 24, 2019",A hilarious action-packed adventure with great replay value. It's mindless enough to suck you in without making your head hurt with insipid plot lines and hilarious enough to keep you invested.

ant-man-and-the-wasp,Preston Barta,False,"Mar 30, 2019","Ant-Man and the Wasp lands the occasional knee-slapping banter and has a playful energy, but it doesn't leave a lasting sting. Evangeline Lilly is the MVP."

ant-man-and-the-wasp,Robert Roten,False,"Jul 18, 2018","A light, funny action film, this is not as dark as many Marvel films. Usually, in these films, the heroes are trying to save the world. This time, the stakes are more modest. It is more of a personal journey, which is a nice change of pace."
ant-man-and-the-wasp,Proma Khosla,False,"Jul 16, 2018","Ant-Man and the Wasp is a family film - about nuclear families, grieving families, broken families, found families. It's about fighting for the safety of your family."
ant-man-and-the-wasp,Damian Levy,False,"Jul 16, 2018","It's a funny, charming, and perfectly fine movie to make you forget about life for an hour or two. Still, for those looking for something more, this movie is not that. It's a Saturday-morning cartoon, brought to life."
ant-man-and-the-wasp,José Martín,False,"Jul 16, 2018","Ant-Man and the Wasp is far from being among the highlights of the genre..., but the good thing is that it does not pretend [to be], because it is aware of its inconsistency within the MCU universe. [Full review in Spanish]"

ant-man-and-the-wasp,Jeffrey M. Anderson,False,"Jul 13, 2018","White it may seem to have very little at stake - it's not the emotional powerhouse that some of the other Marvel movies are - it's a sheer joy, a breath of fresh air."

ant-man-and-the-wasp,Amanda Mazzillo,False,"Jul 12, 2018","Ant-Man and the Wasp blends the superhero film with comedy without feeling disjointed. More jokes landed than in most films of this combination of genres, which makes this more like a superhero comedy than a superhero film with comedic relief."
ant-man-and-the-wasp,Perri Nemiroff,False,"Jul 11, 2018",The stellar ensemble has no trouble nailing the humor while keeping suspense high and conveying some serious stakes. It's a unique and highly entertaining ride I can't wait to go on again.

ant-man-and-the-wasp,Amelia Navascues,False,"Jul 11, 2018","If this movie were a carbohydrate it'd definitely be about as complex as white bread. But admittedly, it is pretty interesting if you've ever been curious what a literal small and low stakes MCU movie looks like."
ant-man-and-the-wasp,Katherine Monk,False,"Jul 11, 2018",[The movie] makes us feel small and gives us the thrill of what it would feel like to be that tiny. It's a cartoon take on Gulliver's Travels - which is the delicious gimmick at the heart of the Ant-Man franchise... and impossible to resist.
ant-man-and-the-wasp,Sarah Knight Adamson,False,"Jul 11, 2018","Unquestionably, the recognition of The Wasp/Evangeline Lily's superhero's name in the film's title is an intelligent choice--along with the choice to center on family."

ant-man-and-the-wasp,Nathanael Hood,False,"Jul 10, 2018","Ant-Man and the Wasp is, after all, a film about protecting and sacrificing for one's family, and it's love that binds such relationships together. And perhaps, Reed suggests, it's love that binds the rest of us as well."

ant-man-and-the-wasp,Eric D. Snider,False,"Jul 6, 2018","Cheerfully (and fittingly) small in scale, with personal stakes rather than fate-of-the-world stuff and a director who doesn't pretend it's anything more than that."

ant-man-and-the-wasp,Mark Daniell,False,"Jul 6, 2018","But for the most part, the two hours you'll spend running around with Marvel's Ant pals is fun and doesn't have the same emotional investment Infinity War or even Black Panther did earlier this year.

ant-man-and-the-wasp,Sandra Hall,False,"Jul 5, 2018","[Ant-Man] gets by on his propensity for knockabout humour, his child-like enthusiasms and the company he keeps. He's likeable, his films are kid-friendly, and that's about it."

ant-man-and-the-wasp,Kristen Lopez,False,"Jul 4, 2018","Actually, the events of Ant-Man and the Wasp don't tie into Avengers: Infinity War, and this creates a weird respite, reminding audiences of the entertainment derived from past Marvel features like Thor: Ragnarok and Spider-Man: Homecoming."
ant-man-and-the-wasp,Jake Coyle,False,"Jul 4, 2018","[""Ant-Man and The Wasp""] is pretty much exactly what I'd want in a superhero movie: a funny cast, zippy action scenes and not an infinity stone in sight."
ant-man-and-the-wasp,Steph Cozza,False,"Jul 3, 2018",Ant-Man and the Wasp is a classic Marvel superhero film but also a fresh palette cleanse to the MCU we've known for so long.

ant-man-and-the-wasp,Dann Gire,False,"Jul 3, 2018","Ant-Man and the Wasp runs nearly two hours, but its merry mix of deft one-liners, visual gags, restrained action sequences and subatomic protoplasmic spectacle never drags, especially with Rudd's witty, confident performance."
ant-man-and-the-wasp,Steven D. Greydanus,False,"Jul 3, 2018","I'm not ashamed to say that I most enjoyed ""Ant-Man"" when it felt like a sequel in spirit to ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids."" ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" doubles down on that vibe and then some."

ant-man-and-the-wasp,Peter Canavese,False,"Jul 3, 2018","A good time at the movies... If the first film felt more carefully laid out, the sequel succeeds in stoking some Pixar-style emotion in its family dynamics..."
ant-man-and-the-wasp,Laura Clifford,True,"Jul 3, 2018","This terminally boring, by-the-numbers installment is credited to five screenwriters and all they've come up with is an inverse game of hot potato with the usual assembly of players (the good guys, the bad guys, the law and a wild card)."
ant-man-and-the-wasp,Britton Peele,False,"Jul 3, 2018","It's fun, it's funny, and it's got such lower stakes than Avengers: Infinity War that it's practically the equivalent of a relaxing Sunday afternoon in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
ant-man-and-the-wasp,Bill Goodykoontz,False,"Jul 3, 2018","We'll get back to the fight against Thanos soon enough. Enthusiasts can resume arguing over various aspects of Marvel minutiae then. For now, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is a nice break."
ant-man-and-the-wasp,Soren Andersen,True,"Jul 3, 2018","There's a lot going on here, which leads to a whole lot of gassy exposition to explain it all, including two separate scenes in which two different groups of good guys are tied to chairs while villains bloviate on the intricacies of the plot."
ant-man-and-the-wasp,Jim Slotek,False,"Jul 3, 2018","Turns out there is a plot device more annoying than time travel - quantum. But the make-it-up-as-we-go-along story aside, Reed still has a flair for using toys at his disposal - glitchy shrinking/growing devices, sight gags, Scott's giant ant pals, etc."
ant-man-and-the-wasp,Simon Miraudo,False,"Jul 3, 2018","The funniest part of Ant-Man and the Wasp is the fact Marvel followed their despairing Avengers: Infinity War cliffhanger with a disposable side-adventure. Are they having a laugh? Yes, and loving it."

ant-man-and-the-wasp,Richard Brody,True,"Jul 2, 2018","The earlier film's freewheeling, low-key loopiness is replaced by a dull and dutiful plot that, with its forced references to other Marvel installments, squeezes the action to fit the franchise."
ant-man-and-the-wasp,Glen Weldon,True,"Jul 2, 2018","What came naturally, and perhaps accidentally, the first time out feels practiced and artificial here. The rhythm is, slightly but persistently, off."

ant-man-and-the-wasp,Beth Accomando,False,"Jun 29, 2018",This focus on family and extended family gives Ant-Man and The Wasp a little more heart than most superhero films.

ant-man-and-the-wasp,Jonathan W. Hickman,False,"Jun 28, 2018","Showcasing Marvel's funny, family-friendly side, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is just fine. And given the heavy narrative that played out in ""Infinity War,"" it's a tiny reprieve from all the death and destruction."
ant-man-and-the-wasp,Tasha Robinson,False,"Jun 28, 2018","It's a movie that understands all the variances of scale, and takes the audience along for the ride as they constantly change."

ant-man-and-the-wasp,Fred Topel,False,"Jun 27, 2018","A sequel... is automatically more interesting because it is building off the history of another movie. This proves true with Ant-Man and The Wasp, but not because it's the sequel to Ant-Man, rather because it's the sequel to Captain America: Civil War."
ant-man-and-the-wasp,Will Leitch,True,"Jun 27, 2018","Occasionally agreeable but ultimately disposable, [it's] a bauble that feels less like a fun side journey and more like a waste of everybody's time."

ant-man-and-the-wasp,Travis Hopson,False,"Jun 27, 2018","What the film does best, though, is entertain us with a kinetic romp through the Marvel Cinematic Universe without being held down by it."
ant-man-and-the-wasp,Jacob Knight,False,"Jun 27, 2018","Ant-Man & The Wasp is a triumph not because it sees its heroes saving us all from oblivion, but because they desire the same comfort their audience does when they're possibly doomed to the void: a gentle embrace from those closest to them."
ant-man-and-the-wasp,Eric Franklin and Caitlin Petrakovitz,False,"Jun 27, 2018","The movie is fun, lighthearted and scaling the list of sequels, but the stakes to see it aren't as high as Infinity War."

ant-man-and-the-wasp,Bilge Ebiri,True,"Jun 27, 2018","It's disjointed, and cluttered, but it's also entertaining in spurts. Is that enough? Just about, and not quite."
ant-man-and-the-wasp,Darren Franich,True,"Jun 27, 2018",This is one of those Marvel products peddling self-aware detachment as a defining narrative strategy...It feels less like a feature film than a meme somebody made about an Ant-Man trailer.
ant-man-and-the-wasp,David Crow,True,"Jun 27, 2018","The basic necessities of narrative momentum are given the requisite focus and care that in better properties can produce exceptional Marvel entertainments... but in the case of Ant-Man, words like ""basic"" and ""requisite"" are always the ceiling."

ant-man-and-the-wasp,Ignatiy Vishnevetsky,False,"Jun 27, 2018","Ant-Man And The Wasp is arguably even more of a straightforward comedy, to the point that it doesn't even have a primary villain."
ant-man-and-the-wasp,Germain Lussier,False,"Jun 27, 2018","Ant-Man and the Wasp is a crowd-pleaser of a film, and a reminder that great characters and fun scripts are what make enjoyable comic book movies-not just a huge shared universe."

ant-man-and-the-wasp,Dan Jolin,False,"Jun 27, 2018","There's no getting away from the fact that Ant-Man And The Wasp, as fun as it is, lacks the sheer, mind-blowing heft of Infinity War... In this new era of Marvel over-achievement, it really does feel like a lesser work."

ant-man-and-the-wasp,Justin Chang,False,"Jun 27, 2018","You might wish the whole movie had found a way to go quantum; you'll certainly long for more Pfeiffer, who has too few scenes but invests each of them with her usual luminosity."

ant-man-and-the-wasp,Peter Martin,True,"Jun 27, 2018","As noted, it's fine and zippy and moves, constantly, almost like the magic card tricks that are introduced early and remain a touching point, a reminder that this is one joke that is not to be taken too seriously."

ant-man-and-the-wasp,Garrett Green,False,"Jun 27, 2018","Ant-Man and The Wasp is a great breather that was sorely needed after Infinity War. It makes me appreciate Avengers more while allowing me to breath, kick up my feet, and just have fun for two hours."
ant-man-and-the-wasp,Alex Abad-Santos,False,"Jun 27, 2018","Ant-Man and the Wasp is an airy, nimble piece of filmmaking: Reed's confidence to unapologetically embrace weirdness gives the franchise its distinctly playful spirit."

ant-man-and-the-wasp,Tim Grierson,False,"Jun 27, 2018","Improving on the lackluster 2015 original, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is winningly modest, no small feat for a film which is part of the gargantuan Marvel Cinematic Universe."

ant-man-and-the-wasp,Michael Phillips,False,"Jun 27, 2018","Rudd is such a friendly, likable presence; he sets this movie's pace, while Lilly's fiercely committed Hope/Wasp acts as the perfect counterweight. Rudd's scenes with Lilly and with Fortson make the movie matter in human terms."
ant-man-and-the-wasp,Courtney Howard,False,"Jun 27, 2018","Ant-Man And The Wasp surpasses the original by miles, functioning best when it embraces its sheer absurdity and loopy lunacy."

ant-man,Sean Axmaker,False,"Apr 14, 2023","This is a superhero film as a caper comedy adventure and that’s part of the charm. There’s a lack of bombast and epic scale, refreshing in a genre that keeps trying to top itself."
ant-man,Keith Garlington,False,"Aug 19, 2022",“Ant-Man” is an easy movie to digest. It dabbles in promising areas and has its share of fun scenes and cool visual effects. But it also squanders a lot of its potential by traveling down well-worn and overused paths.

ant-man,Hosea Rupprecht,False,"Sep 13, 2021","If you're a big fan of the ever-expanding Marvel cinematic universe, you'll love the addition of Ant-Man to the mix. If you're just out to see a movie and pick this one because it sounds weird and the show time is right, you're in for some laughs..."

ant-man,Kelechi Ehenulo,True,"Jul 17, 2020","It's not horribly bad because I've seen worse. However it doesn't do anything special to really set it apart from other comic book films. In the end, it can be a bit forgettable."
ant-man,Allen Almachar,False,"Jul 15, 2020","The performances of the main cast, the refreshing display of Ant-Man's abilities, Michael Pena's superb comedic role, and a weird yet dynamic finale make this a superhero blockbuster worth checking out."

ant-man,Christie Cronan,False,"Feb 4, 2020",The recurring theme of the importance of a father/daughter relationship is really touching.
ant-man,Chris McCoy,False,"Jan 10, 2020","For the sections of its 117-minute running time when it's focusing on its core plot, Ant-Man is a good time at the movies."
ant-man,Grethe Kemp,True,"Jan 8, 2020","It's all so formulaic, so intentional, so transparently focused on a specific audience to milk a specific dollar."
ant-man,Siddhant Adlakha,True,"Dec 15, 2019","Paul Rudd brings a boyish charm to any role he plays. His ""Aw, shucks!"" demeanor is perfect for the film's version of Scott Lang, though this iteration of the character is also trapped in a story that can't decide what it wants him to be."
ant-man,Debbie Lynn Elias,False,"Dec 8, 2019","Paul Rudd puts the ""A"" in Ant-Man. Affable, likeable, down to earth...There is a softer heroic element to the story and film overall which is brought to life by the authentic Jimmy Stewart ""aw shucks"" persona of Rudd."
ant-man,Katie Smith-Wong,False,"Nov 19, 2019","Ant-Man perfectly ties into the current stage of the cinematic universe, while playing on the strengths of making a great lead character."
ant-man,Brandon Davis,False,"Nov 13, 2019","Ant-Man is a super hero heist movie with all sorts of emphasis on super. Rich characters, a formidable villain, and fun references to the wider Marvel Universe make Ant-Man one of Marvel's biggest spectacles to date."
ant-man,Kate Rodger,False,"Sep 7, 2019","This feels like Marvel's most intimate film to date, and wrapped in the kind of fun that Guardians of the Galaxy delivered in spades."
ant-man,Josh Wilding,False,"Sep 1, 2019","Even those who nitpick Marvel's approach to their movies are sure to find something to love in Ant-Man, while fans will undoubtedly adore each and every second. A funny movie with a lot of heart, it's one of Marvel Studios' best origin stories."
ant-man,Sean Collier,False,"Aug 23, 2019","Ant-Man is a fine and entertaining chapter in the story. It's often funny, it has a great cast ... and its effects are impressive."
ant-man,Ryan Syrek,False,"Jul 9, 2019",Ant-Man is great; an optimistic jaunt with plenty of cleverness and oodles of joy. Yet another feather in Marvel Studio's increasingly peacocked cap.
ant-man,Mattie Lucas,False,"Jul 5, 2019",One of the most thoroughly entertaining films Marvel has yet produced and shows the superhero genre still has a few tricks up its sleeve to keep from giving us the same old song and dance over and over again.
ant-man,Andrew Daley,False,"May 7, 2019","Making the best of a bad creative situation, Ant-Man has emerged unexpectedly as the best non-superhero superhero film in cinemas. Marvel's next film has big shoes to fill."
ant-man,Mae Abdulbaki,False,"May 2, 2019","Ant-Man is entertaining for what it is, but is average on the scale of all the Marvel films so far. Its action is fantastic, Ant-Man's abilities pretty cool, and the setup for future films solid enough."
ant-man,Rachel Wagner,False,"Apr 26, 2019",Part of what makes Ant-Man work is they have assembled an incredibly charismatic and likable cast.
ant-man,Julie Crawford,False,"Apr 17, 2019","Despite the suit and the Lilliputian size, Rudd manages to be his likeable self, which compensates when the action lags."

ant-man,Micheal Compton,False,"Jan 23, 2019","This is an origin story with plenty of origin, but also a sly kind of humor that sometimes gets pushed aside in all these comic book films."

ant-man,Johnny Gayzmonic,False,"Oct 31, 2018","It's deceptively exciting, genuinely funny, and has a nostalgic aura about it that harkens back to the campy/serious Jack Kirby days of Marvel Comics."

ant-man,Andre Meadows,False,"Mar 2, 2018","It's not bad, but it's definitely a movie that has lost its way in the process of business/movie making. You can see what this movie could have been. You'll still enjoy it, it's just a shame."

ant-man,Matthew Bond,False,"Oct 30, 2017","Yes, it's funny at times and nearly always entertaining but, helped by a terrific cast and a thoughtfully constructed screenplay, Ant-Man has enough gravitas and drama to keep an open-minded adult audience entertained, alongside its target younger market."

ant-man,Sarah Marrs,False,"Oct 14, 2017","Ant-Man is a very enjoyable movie on its own merit. Paul Rudd's everyman charm is put to good use as Scott Lang, but Michael Pena walks away with the best parts of the movie as Scott's former cell mate, Luis."

ant-man,John Lui,False,"May 24, 2016","The plot is as basic as it gets and in its antagonist-protagonist set-up, almost an exact copy of the Spider-Man-Green Goblin situation. But who cares? When you have a cast delivering comedy this strong, plot would only get in the way."

ant-man,Marija Djurovic,False,"Apr 6, 2016","The previous anonymity of miniature-sized superhero who dates back to the 60s, doesn't prevent it from becoming one of the most entertaining and successful combinations of action and comedy in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
ant-man,Theresa Smith,False,"Mar 7, 2016","Funny, engaging and entertaining, Marvel's latest superhero movie is by far their most kid-friendly. While there is scary action galore, it comes in managable comprehensible bites and Paul Rudd's Scott Lang/Ant-Man is a genial character."
ant-man,Emine Yildirim,False,"Feb 29, 2016","Rudd is indeed the right man for the job, for at all times he seems at peace with himself, wearing a slightly mischievous grin and speaking in soft tones that make you want to pour your heart out to him as if he were your very old friend."
ant-man,Martin Roberts,True,"Feb 26, 2016","So Ant-Man is an admirable but flawed attempt to expand the Marvel canon. The script is far from Marvel's best and, considering the film aims to be light hearted, lacks the laughs that bolster so many of these films."
ant-man,Jordan Raup,False,"Feb 22, 2016","Delighting with inventive setpieces and an affable lead in Paul Rudd, Ant-Man is eccentric enough to amuse, but can often feel watered-down in execution."

ant-man,Emily St. James,False,"Dec 14, 2015","Ant-Man has its charms, but they're frequently lost beneath a story that feels like a patchwork job. It's a fun watch, but also a frustrating one."
ant-man,Jason Best,False,"Dec 13, 2015","Rudd's humorously self-deprecating persona works wonders with the material and he gets terrific support from Michael Peña, who takes [a] stereotypical Latino sidekick role... and makes it fizz with good-natured fun."

ant-man,Alex Leadbeater,False,"Nov 6, 2015","As fun as you expect from Marvel, but really misses Edgar Wright."
ant-man,John Beifuss,False,"Nov 5, 2015",Marvel's signature gigantism is reversed with agreeable results.
ant-man,Eric Melin,False,"Oct 7, 2015","One of the biggest pleasures is its overall subversion of the superhero genre. It still feels like a Marvel product, and it suffers from a typically one-dimensional bad guy, but it also has a lot of fun turning expectation on its head."
ant-man,Walter Chaw,False,"Sep 8, 2015",any film that references The Incredible Shrinking Man so beautifully deserves its moment on the stage.

ant-man,David Keyes,False,"Aug 19, 2015","When you get right down to it, there is something rather amusing about watching a protagonist the size of a fingernail doing ambitious stunt work while he attempts to survive dangerous obstacles."
ant-man,Richard Roeper,True,"Aug 14, 2015","[Ants are] pests, and that's just a weird place to start for a superhero, especially if he never strays too far from his origins."
ant-man,Mel Campbell,False,"Aug 14, 2015",Ant-Man is entertaining because it uses big-movie tricks without big-movie hyperbole.
ant-man,Wesley Lovell,False,"Aug 12, 2015","Pick a formula. Include a wonderful actor. Make everything work in spite of the unoriginality that's working against it. You get ""Ant-Man."""

ant-man,Christian Toto,False,"Aug 12, 2015",For once the bad buzz and worse trailers were wrong. This hero deserves a movie all his own.

ant-man,Brad Keefe,False,"Aug 6, 2015","Director Peyton Reed has a lot of fun with the concept, though epic battles on tiny scales can be a bit less breathtaking."
ant-man,Josh Terry,False,"Aug 5, 2015","Ant-Man is this year's Guardians of the Galaxy. It focuses on a peripheral, wisecracking member of the Marvel Universe, adding a generous dose of humor to its superhero action."
ant-man,Ken Hanke,False,"Aug 5, 2015","Cheeky, good-natured, clever and even a little on the subversive side, Ant-Man is that rarest of comic-book movies -- one that manages to be personal and doesn't take itself too seriously."
ant-man,Leigh Paatsch,False,"Jul 31, 2015","Both an entertaining and eminently disposable superhero movie, Ant-Man rounds out Marvel Studios' much-vaunted 'Phase Two' of its masterplan to maintain world domination of mainstream cinema."
ant-man,Josh Hylton,False,"Jul 31, 2015","I'm not entirely convinced the character will mix well into the overall Marvel Cinematic Universe when he inevitably starts to crossover into other superhero films, but as a standalone adventure, ""Ant-Man"" is undeniably entertaining."

ant-man,Tim Brayton,False,"Jul 25, 2015",The most typical film yet made in the now 12-picture Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is up to the individual viewer to decide if that's a compliment or a vicious & lacerating criticism.

ant-man,Reagan Gavin Rasquinha,False,"Jul 24, 2015",Rudd's Lang is refreshingly self-effacing and charming. Pena is flat-out hilarious.

ant-man,Rebecca Cusey,False,"Jul 21, 2015","Like its predecessor, ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" ""Ant-Man"" plays with the Marvel universe without upending it. It manages to make fun of the superhero genre while still fully embracing the emotions that make the genre powerful."

ant-man,Glenn Lovell,False,"Jul 18, 2015",Macro-Marvel ... wisely marketed at the small fry. It's closer to 'Antz' than the mutant radioactive variety (in 'Them!').

ant-man,Bob Bloom,False,"Jul 17, 2015","With the likable Paul Rudd buffed up to portray Scott Lang, former cat burglar-turned-superhero, ""Ant-Man"" has a self-deprecating and witty edge."
ant-man,Sergio López Aguirre,False,"Jul 17, 2015","In the end, Ant-Man is a film that entertains, thrills and closes Phase 2 of the MCU in a dignified way. [full review in Spanish]"
ant-man,Jenna Busch,False,"Jul 17, 2015","""It feels like the lead up to Yellowjacket was all cut out. I hope that's the case. Honestly, I expected him to say 'mwahaha' at one point."""
ant-man,Mike McGranaghan,False,"Jul 17, 2015","We've had so many superhero movies in the last decade that it's amazing one can still feel surprising. Ant-Man does. In that sense, it's a triumph."
ant-man,Oswaldo Betancourt Lozano,False,"Jul 17, 2015",You walk in with no expectations and leave satisfied. [full review in Spanish]
ant-man,Andrew O'Hehir,False,"Jul 17, 2015",In its medium-stupid and mismanaged fashion it's not so awful.
ant-man,John Nugent,False,"Jul 17, 2015",Ant-Man's unlikely charm is just enough to stop it from being squished at the cinematic picnic.
ant-man,David Sexton,True,"Jul 17, 2015",Ant-Man just isn't that great an idea and the film exists only because the Marvel machine is working so remorselessly through its massive back catalogue.
ant-man,David Edwards,False,"Jul 17, 2015","While boasting all the dazzling special effects we've come to expect from the Iron Man, Captain America and Thor series, this is Marvel in modest form - and small turns out to be beautiful."
ant-man,Owen Gleiberman,True,"Jul 17, 2015","The film isn't terrible but it makes earlier Marvel outings look like masterpieces. There's hardly a trope in it you haven't seen before, and done with far greater flair. It feels like making a mountain out of an anthill."
ant-man,Brian Viner,False,"Jul 17, 2015","When the essence of a story is shrinking (and enlarging), the computer-generated effects department had better be on top form, and here, predictably, they are."
ant-man,Steven D. Greydanus,False,"Jul 17, 2015","I enjoyed ""Ant-Man"" most as small-scale spectacle, a high-tech update on ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" cinema...The plot, it must be said, rewards not thinking about it."
ant-man,John Hanlon,False,"Jul 17, 2015",Marvel wins big by going small in its latest adventure.
ant-man,Sean P. Means,False,"Jul 17, 2015","One could take a magnifying glass to ""Ant-Man,"" but the results would be disastrous. This is a superhero movie to be enjoyed in the moment."
ant-man,Pete Vonder Haar,False,"Jul 17, 2015","The result is a lighter, more overtly comedic effort than most Marvel films, and Wright's influence is still all over the finished product."
ant-man,James Verniere,False,"Jul 17, 2015","Go Ant-Man, more fun than the last Avengers movie by a long shot. Converted 3D still looks awful, however."
ant-man,Will Leitch,True,"Jul 17, 2015","A fairly straightforward, conventional superhero story, where a mere mortal gathers the ability to be extraordinary and then becomes a hero. This is no way to sell me on a story about a guy who can make himself the size of an ant."
ant-man,Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat,False,"Jul 17, 2015",A rousing 3-D sci-fi adventure that celebrates the teamwork between a man on an important mission and a band of insects.
ant-man,Lisa Kennedy,False,"Jul 17, 2015","The cast is better than solid. Directed by Peyton Reed, the action is a zippy pleasure. The more Scott shrinks, the bigger the fun. The visual effects are witty, especially when he begins making allies of various ant colonies."
ant-man,Matthew Razak,False,"Jul 17, 2015",It's exactly what the MCU needs right now: a creative dose of fun.
ant-man,Sandie Angulo Chen,False,"Jul 17, 2015","Clever, funny, cool Marvel movie has lots of sci-fi action."
ant-man,Clint O'Connor,False,"Jul 17, 2015","Rudd's charm and easygoing sense of humor keeps us engaged, even though 'Ant-Man' is the least clever and ambitious of the recent spate of Marvel movies."
ant-man,Gary Wolcott,False,"Jul 17, 2015","Unlike the two-dimensional pages of a comic book, and unlike it's two-dimensional Marvel Comics movie character cousins, Ant-Man is three-dimensional fun."
ant-man,Greg Maki,False,"Jul 17, 2015","In more ways than one, ""Ant-Man"" is smaller than most of the rest of the MCU. The fate of the world is not immediately at stake, and that's a refreshing change."
ant-man,Rich Cline,False,"Jul 17, 2015","The increasingly stale Marvel formula gets a blast of fresh air in this rollocking adventure movie, which combines a steady stream of character-based comedy with action sequences that are integrated seamlessly into the plot."
ant-man,Mike Scott,False,"Jul 17, 2015","Ant-Man is a load of a fun, a light-hearted superhero heist film with a sense of humor and playfulness that will make you forget just how silly the whole thing is."
ant-man,Rob Thomas,False,"Jul 17, 2015","If you're worn out by superhero movies featuring apocalyptic battles in which cities are leveled, may I present ""Ant-Man,"" in which the climactic showdown takes place aboard a Thomas the Tank Engine train set. And not even the deluxe version."
ant-man,Monica Castillo,False,"Jul 17, 2015","It might take another Ant-Man movie (you know it's in the works) to see his character grow once the suit's luster has worn down, but the framework is there to create an interesting superhero."
ant-man,Willie Waffle,False,"Jul 17, 2015","I always thought this was the dumbest idea ever, and I was wrong."
ant-man,Jonathan W. Hickman,False,"Jul 17, 2015","The best thing about ""Ant-Man"" is that is starts small and stays that way."
ant-man,David Edelstein,False,"Jul 17, 2015","Ant-Man isn't much more than pleasant (Peyton Reed directs limply), but anything Marvel that doesn't feel Marvel-ish makes me smile."
ant-man,Barry Hertz,False,"Jul 17, 2015","Not just one of the more entertaining Marvel movies - infinitely better than Joss Whedon's overstuffed Avengers: Age of Ultron - but a genuinely fun and clever deconstruction of the genre, too."
ant-man,Adam Graham,False,"Jul 17, 2015","For a small movie, ""Ant-Man"" has a lot going on. Rudd makes it work."
ant-man,Anders Wright,False,"Jul 17, 2015","Yes, it's fine, but not much more than that. Which is good news for Marvel, which must have wondered if it had an Ant problem."
ant-man,Steve Crum,True,"Jul 17, 2015","'Ant-Man' will appeal mostly to ant-people. Translated: children. Factor in fans of Paul Rudd and Marvel superheroes, and you could have a box office community picnic."
ant-man,Dustin Putman,False,"Jul 16, 2015","Taking itself seriously without being too serious, the film proves fun all the same, confirming that it is possible to side with a superhero who is the size of a fingertip without once feeling the need to laugh at him."
ant-man,Jeffrey Lyles,False,"Jul 16, 2015",Guaranteed to feature 2015's best climactic battle atop a train set -- pardon the terrible pun -- 'Ant-Man' is freaking f-ANT-astic fun and the year's most pleasant surprise.
ant-man,Kurt Loder,False,"Jul 16, 2015","Not the Marvel misfire that fans of the titular tiny guy might have expected, but it's still lumpy and trifling."
ant-man,Christopher Lawrence,True,"Jul 16, 2015","There's a decent amount of fun to be had... But considering Marvel's stellar track record and the comedic wonderfulness of its star, Paul Rudd, Ant-Man is more than a little disappointing."
ant-man,Peter Rainer,False,"Jul 16, 2015","I wish the film had gone even further into loopiness. Like Ant-Man, the film, directed by Peyton Reed, comes in two sizes -- it's sometimes big on laughs but often small on risk-taking."
ant-man,Joe Gross,False,"Jul 16, 2015","Tou don't need to know the Avengers from the Justice League to enjoy this weird romp starring Paul Rudd as Scott Lang, a burglar with a heart of gold."
ant-man,Jake Coyle,True,"Jul 16, 2015","The result is a film not quite sure of itself, like it's wearing clothes a size too big."
ant-man,Stephen Rebello,False,"Jul 16, 2015","The thing has got big laughs, a real heartbeat, and a modesty of scale that, next to the mega machinery of most Marvel movies, is kind of a relief."
ant-man,Kirk Baird,False,"Jul 16, 2015",Ant-Man is fun but surprisingly conventional.
ant-man,Nell Minow,False,"Jul 16, 2015","There's nothing snarky or air quote-ish about the story, but there is a recognition that this is a superhero the size of a grain of rice. In this case, that's super enough."
ant-man,Randall King,False,"Jul 16, 2015","Another cog in the Marvel machine, it runs smoothly, with Douglas providing the necessary gravitas and Stoll giving emotional viability to his unbalanced villain."
ant-man,Steven Rea,False,"Jul 16, 2015","Although its origin-story machinations get the better of it, Ant-Man isn't a bust."
ant-man,James Berardinelli,True,"Jul 16, 2015","The attempts at overt comedy are hit-and-miss. The heist elements are derivative and not nearly as inventive as one might expect given the possibilities. The action sequences are variable and the dramatic moments... the less said, the better."
ant-man,Norman Wilner,False,"Jul 16, 2015","Ant-Man does some things very well, like letting Paul Rudd inhabit a comic-book character in precisely the same way Iron Man put a goatee on Robert Downey Jr. and called him Tony Stark."
ant-man,Chris Knight,False,"Jul 16, 2015","Mostly the film keeps to the lighter side, aided by Michael Peña in a comic-even-more-relief role, and by his criminal buddies Kurt, Dave and Gale."
ant-man,Daniel Barnes,True,"Jul 16, 2015","Ant-Man doesn't even try to break the mold, but at least it's less busy and bombastic than most Marvel offerings."
ant-man,Mark Dujsik,True,"Jul 16, 2015","Why, oh why, must these movies telling the story of the beginnings of a superhero do the same things over and over and over again?"
ant-man,Rafer Guzman,False,"Jul 16, 2015",Rudd's charm and an overall sense of silliness make for breezy summer fun. It's also Marvel's most kid-friendly movie yet.
ant-man,Andrew Lapin,True,"Jul 16, 2015","Pretending there's a more fascinating version of this film out there somewhere, like the Richard Donner cut of Superman II, is a great way to come to terms with how rote and unremarkable Ant-Man is."
ant-man,Steve Newall,False,"Jul 16, 2015",This is the most straight-forward and fun Marvel movie for ages.
ant-man,Nick Schager,True,"Jul 16, 2015","It's a film that always feels this close to being unique, and funny, and thrilling. Which is why when it misses its mark, over and over and over again, the sound of its failure resounds that much louder."
ant-man,Paul Mount,False,"Jul 16, 2015","Fast, fun-packed (but never frivolous) and riotously, raucously enjoyable."
ant-man,Linda Barnard,False,"Jul 16, 2015","Rudd is ideal for Ant-Man's aw-shucks, I'm not into this hero business playfulness. He gleefully riffs on it."
ant-man,Joe Morgenstern,True,"Jul 16, 2015","A film that will surely be popular, given Marvel's marketing might, but one that's woefully short on coherence and originality."
ant-man,Ty Burr,True,"Jul 16, 2015","This acceptably diverting superhero outing keeps threatening to break free and become something special, but in the end, there's just too much at stake. And that's a shame, especially for Paul Rudd fans."
ant-man,Richard von Busack,False,"Jul 16, 2015","When one of his pet ants is killed, Scott (Rudd) threatens the villain with a wee fist: ""You're going to regret this!"" This movie about shrinkage has a nice sense of proportion."
ant-man,Dann Gire,False,"Jul 16, 2015","Yes, Ant-Man awkwardly vacillates between broad comedy and earnest adventure, and Pena's cartoony sidekick seems to belong in some other less serious movie. But Ant-Man works. In spots, it works well."
ant-man,Joe Williams,False,"Jul 16, 2015","Everyone involved can proudly declare, ""Honey, I shrunk the Marvel Cinematic Universe."""
ant-man,Philippa Hawker,False,"Jul 16, 2015","This new feature takes issues of absurdity and scale to heart in many ways; it is modest as well as ambitious, and its title character is played by Paul Rudd, the most appealingly self-deprecating of actors."
ant-man,Ryan Gilbey,False,"Jul 16, 2015","Ant-Man is a salvage job but a good one. In common with Guardians of the Galaxy, it exhibits a B-movie nuttiness not permitted in the studio's flagship films: your Iron Man, your Avengers."
ant-man,Dana Barbuto,False,"Jul 16, 2015","'Ant-Man"" isn't your typical Marvel bombast. Instead of a sensory assault, it's more content with taking a quiet-and-quaint approach to introducing one of the stable's lesser-known superheroes."
ant-man,Erin Free,False,"Jul 16, 2015","As with all of Marvel Studios' movies, the action, humour and innate silliness is tempered with something a little more thoughtful and meditative, making for a highly entertaining mix."
ant-man,Gaspar Zimerman,False,"Jul 16, 2015","It is lighter and less pyrotechnic, more friendly and entertaining than other Marvel products. [full review in Spanish]"

ant-man,Jon Niccum,False,"Jul 16, 2015","""Ant-Man"" becomes the first Marvel movie to deliver a third act that's better than the first two."
ant-man,Alex Doenau,False,"Jul 16, 2015","Ant-Man is a neat package, that comfortably wears its connection to the Marvel Cinematic Universe without labouring the point."
ant-man,Michael Smith,False,"Jul 16, 2015","Despite a story that sometimes strains under cliches, several supporting characters shine and the action-humor combinations will leave you smiling always and laughing often."
ant-man,Nigel Andrews,True,"Jul 16, 2015",We start with carefree exhilaration. ... But - wages of bingemanship - we then proceed to boorish silliness and finally stupor.
ant-man,Jim Judy,False,"Jul 16, 2015","Thankfully never takes itself too seriously and isn't interested in bashing characters through buildings and streets like an out of control video game. (Full Content Review - Violence, Sexual Content, Profanity, etc. - for Parents also available)"
ant-man,Rick Bentley,True,"Jul 16, 2015",Director Peyton Reed tries to piece it together but there's just no way to make the scenes with Rudd seem like anything more than a rejected Saturday Night Live skit.
ant-man,Josh Kupecki,False,"Jul 16, 2015","Ant-Man is infectious, silly entertainment, a popcorn flick that knows what it is and does what it does to an intoxicating degree."
ant-man,Michael O'Sullivan,False,"Jul 16, 2015","The second half of this nearly two-hour film is a pure delight - fast-paced and funny and filled with special effects and humor as great as any recent Marvel movie, with the possible exception of ""Guardians of the Galaxy."""
ant-man,Chris Bumbray,False,"Jul 16, 2015",Colorful and creative. One of the better Marvel movies. Paul Rudd is perfectly cast.
ant-man,Peter Bradshaw,False,"Jul 16, 2015","There are some clever and nicely conceived sequences, and some bursts of wit - though given the writing firepower involved, there should really have been more wit."
ant-man,Luke Y. Thompson,False,"Jul 16, 2015",...it's understandable why Edgar Wright might have wanted to keep it insulated... - that Reed manages to make it feel that way most of the time even when it isn't is a deft feat indeed.
ant-man,Radheyan Simonpillai,False,"Jul 16, 2015","Just another run-of-the-mill Marvel origin story that surprises with bursts of flair and humor, as if remnants from Wright and Cornish's script managed to fight their way into the final cut."
ant-man,Laura Clifford,False,"Jul 16, 2015","It's ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" via ""Them"" crossed with ""Toy Story"" set in a super hero world."
ant-man,Robert Wilonsky,False,"Jul 16, 2015","Marvel hasn't made a movie this fun - this bright, this charming, this joyful -- since the first Iron Man, in which Robert Downey Jr.'s entitled smirk was its most lethal weapon."
ant-man,John Anderson,False,"Jul 16, 2015","Not only one of the more entertainingly human fantasies to come out of the studio, but it also defies the bedrock fanboy aesthetic that you don't want to merely watch the superhero-you want to be the superhero."
ant-man,Rex Reed,True,"Jul 16, 2015",Yawn.
ant-man,Frank Swietek,True,"Jul 16, 2015",The movie's almost self-deprecatory sense of tongue-in-cheek humility is matched by the fact that all the pleasures it affords are very small indeed.
ant-man,Ignatiy Vishnevetsky,False,"Jul 16, 2015","An enjoyable, intermittently inspired effects-driven comedy and a welcome antidote to the over-burdened world-saving that seems to define big-screen superhero stories."
ant-man,Vincent Mancini,True,"Jul 16, 2015","A movie that feels like it came off an assembly line, which makes it that much stranger when it keeps attempting comedy. Aw, look, the widget has jokes!"
ant-man,Josh Spiegel,False,"Jul 16, 2015","Although Ant-Man is superficially shackled to the necessities of the MCU, it's snappier, lighter, and sharper than Marvel's more overblown films of late."
ant-man,Daniel M. Kimmel,False,"Jul 16, 2015","For the comic book geeks, this is manna from cinematic heaven. As for the rest of us, this a lesser but fun effort."
ant-man,Peter Travers,False,"Jul 16, 2015",Glides us over trouble spots in tone and pacing. The little bastard from Marvel's second-tier gets the job done.
ant-man,A.O. Scott,False,"Jul 16, 2015","Like ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" last year's off-brand Marvel hit, ""Ant-Man"" dabbles in the bright, playful colors of the superhero spectrum, reveling in moments of cartoonish whimsy and smirky humor."
ant-man,Soren Andersen,True,"Jul 16, 2015","When your most memorable character turns out to be Thomas the Tank Engine, featured in two hilarious scenes, you know your picture about a tiny superhero has big, big problems."
ant-man,Joe Neumaier,False,"Jul 16, 2015","""Ant-man"" is proof that pretty good things come in small packages."
ant-man,Jeff Baker,False,"Jul 16, 2015","Rudd acquits himself well in his superhero debut, and the finished product is Marvel on Training Wheels, an introduction into the superhero universe for the youngest moviegoers ..."

ant-man,Bill Goodykoontz,False,"Jul 16, 2015","It chugs along happily enough, but never kicks into the higher gear you keep waiting (and hoping) for."
ant-man,Marshall Fine,False,"Jul 16, 2015",One of the summer's most entertaining... one of only a handful of comic-book movies to transcend the limits of that increasingly cookie-cutter genre.
ant-man,Matt Neal,False,"Jul 16, 2015","With its small-scale action and tongue-in-cheek irreverence, Ant-Man is a welcome relief from the large-scale destruction and save-the-universe shenanigans of recent superhero movies."
ant-man,Josh Bell,False,"Jul 16, 2015","A looser, funnier and lower-stakes story than Marvel's typical world-ending spectacles."
ant-man,Brian Orndorf,True,"Jul 15, 2015","Certainly someone with more action experience could do justice to the character's flexibility and sense of honor. In Reed's hands, ""Ant-Man"" feels about as small as its main character."
ant-man,Julian Roman,False,"Jul 15, 2015","'Ant-Man starts weak, but finishes strong. What starts as a drizzle becomes a hurricane of action and special effects as 'Ant-Man' kicks into high gear during its second half."
ant-man,Blake Howard,True,"Jul 15, 2015","Ant-Man isn't so much watching, as living through Weekend At Bernie's. Peyton Reed and co. come and parade the soulless and lifeless corpse of an Edgar Wright film."
ant-man,Matt Donato,True,"Jul 15, 2015","Ant-Man cares more about setting up the future than addressing the present, and for that, Paul Rudd's best efforts as the wise-cracking insect companion are overshadowed by what's to come."
ant-man,Kristian Harloff,False,"Jul 15, 2015","Poking fun at itself while still treating it's subject matter with respect is no easy task, but the stars handle it magnificently. ""Ant-Man"" is one of the most unexpectedly fun rides you can have in the MCU...or anywhere else for that matter."
ant-man,Mark Ellis,False,"Jul 15, 2015","The tie-ins with the MCU are abundant but we never feel like ""Ant-Man"" is leaning on it's big brothers too much; as a stand-alone movie this is the very reason I go to the theater at all: great action, big laughs and entertaining as hell."
ant-man,Joanna Langfield,True,"Jul 15, 2015","If you can hang in there an hour and a half, this latest Marvel installment does, finally, deliver. But why do we have to wait so long?"
ant-man,Blake Goble,False,"Jul 15, 2015","From the bongo-heavy heist music, to the deft sight gags, to little details like the scratches Scott Lang leaves while he's tiny, there's no shortage of great stuff to see and enjoy - no magnifying glass required."
ant-man,Travis Hopson,False,"Jul 15, 2015","Ant-Man fits neatly into the overall Marvel formula, even though it follows the beats of a traditional heist movie."
ant-man,Cary Darling,False,"Jul 15, 2015","As it dutifully marches toward its special-effects-driven conclusion, Ant-Man has enough charm to be engaging if not particularly memorable once the end credits roll"

ant-man,Kenneth Turan,False,"Jul 15, 2015","You can't have a good Ant-Man movie without a good Ant-Man, and in the genial and charming everyman Paul Rudd, the filmmakers have done it right."
ant-man,Matt Pais,False,"Jul 15, 2015","Funnier than Trainwreck and far better-told than Avengers: Age of Ultron, as most movies are."
ant-man,Mick LaSalle,False,"Jul 15, 2015","The best thing about ""Ant-Man"" is that, for much of its running time, it doesn't seem like a Marvel Comics superhero movie. The worst thing about it is that it eventually does."
ant-man,Glenn Kenny,False,"Jul 15, 2015","It's delightful and almost miraculous the way this movie manages to work as a comic heist picture on a huge scale, and with a comic science-fiction picture blended into it...while managing to cohere to the whole, you know, Marvel thing."
ant-man,John Gholson,False,"Jul 15, 2015",The finale is something else - a symphony of comedy and action mayhem that outclasses every single second that comes before it. Nothing else in the movie even comes close.
ant-man,Steve Tilley,False,"Jul 15, 2015","Ant-Man is an entertaining blend of a superhero origin story and a caper film, the funniest and most grounded Marvel movie to date."
ant-man,Peter Canavese,False,"Jul 15, 2015","With its playful use of scale, Ant-Man drops a dollop of Lewis Carroll whimsy on the usual clashes of good and evil."
ant-man,Jason Zingale,False,"Jul 15, 2015",A funny and fast-paced superhero film that serves as a welcome breath of fresh air compared to the typical end-of-the-world summer blockbusters.
ant-man,Matt Prigge,False,"Jul 15, 2015",If more of these would include nods to the Wallace and Gromit short 'The Wrong Trousers' then a future of endless Marvels wouldn't seem so grim.
ant-man,Jason Gorber,False,"Jul 14, 2015","Ant-Man is, well, OK, and maybe that's enough. I wanted more, and those moments where it looked like I was going to get it, only to have things not quite come to fruition, makes the film as frustrating as it is enjoyable."
ant-man,Simon Miraudo,False,"Jul 14, 2015","This is the sorbet. Imperfect and perhaps creatively-compromised, Ant-Man nonetheless reinvigorated me, and, for the first time in a while, made me ready for more. No small feat."
ant-man,Tony Hicks,False,"Jul 14, 2015","Like all great heroes, Ant-Man arrives in the nick of time ... for an entire genre."
ant-man,Bryan Bishop,False,"Jul 14, 2015","Powered by Rudd's goofy, good-guy sentimentality, Ant-Man filled me with something that's become a rather rare commodity in superhero movies: joy."
ant-man,Steve Persall,False,"Jul 14, 2015","Never thought I'd type this about a comic book movie, but Ant-Man needs to take itself more seriously."
ant-man,Jake Cole,True,"Jul 14, 2015","Half-assed mentions of the Avengers, as well as a few cameo appearances sprinkled both within the feature and in its credits stingers, exude less shame than a crowd-pandering politico."
ant-man,Roger Moore,False,"Jul 14, 2015","Comic book movies are getting pretty deep into the B-list. So whatever its B-movie charms, this one never feels like it can play with the big boys."
ant-man,Tom Glasson,False,"Jul 14, 2015","Funny, charming and very family friendly, Ant-Man is a solid debut for what will almost certainly develop into a meatier and more assured trilogy."
ant-man,Chris Stuckmann,False,"Jul 14, 2015","Ant-Man has a suitably small-scale story for its tiny hero, which was a breath of fresh air when compared to the other more bloated entries in the MCU."
ant-man,Michael Phillips,False,"Jul 13, 2015","The plot's the same old thing. Mad, mad, mad, mad science; imminent apocalypse; parent/child issues; blah blah blaggidy blah. The tone of Ant-Man, however, is relatively light and predominantly comic."
ant-man,Louise Keller,False,"Jul 13, 2015","Refreshingly simple and loads of fun, Ant-Man maximizes on its point of difference of its smallest super-hero by coating it with lots of laughter and a likeable vibe"
ant-man,Scott A. Mantz,False,"Jul 13, 2015","It has a big heart, it's a lot of fun, and that vibrancy is infectious."
ant-man,Ethan Alter,True,"Jul 13, 2015",The narrative is leaden and lumpy in a way that suggests prolonged script-tinkering.
ant-man,Katherine McLaughlin,False,"Jul 13, 2015",A charming and eccentric heist film with a great sense of humour.
ant-man,MaryAnn Johanson,False,"Jul 13, 2015","Marvel's tiniest hero stars in the Marvel Cinematic Universe's smallest movie so far, one that loses Paul Rudd's charm among familiar comic-book action."
ant-man,Andy Lea,True,"Jul 11, 2015","The comedy is muted, the action scenes are slick but forgettable and the character's USP is largely wasted."
ant-man,Poppy-Jay Palmer,False,"Jul 10, 2015","It's a heist movie. That's all it is, a fun heist movie with powers and explosions and awesome costumes and ant armies. It's also extremely well directed."
ant-man,Jeremy Aspinall,False,"Jul 9, 2015","In the end, it may be more comedy than grand superhero epic, but Marvel and Disney should still be laughing all the way to the bank."
ant-man,Geoffrey Macnab,False,"Jul 9, 2015","It is refreshing to encounter an action-adventure with a Lilliputian lightness of touch. The downside, though, is that Ant-Man seems very insubstantial fare by comparison with Iron Man, Captain America et al."
ant-man,Alan Scherstuhl,False,"Jul 9, 2015",Ant-Man is the first Marvel film - and the first of this summer's pixels-go-kablooey time-wasters - to get better as it goes.
ant-man,Robbie Collin,False,"Jul 9, 2015","Brisk humour, keenly felt dramatic stakes, and invention over scale. You know: small pleasures."

ant-man,Matt Patches,False,"Jul 9, 2015","[Snapping] from big to small to big to small, special effects transform Rudd into a micro-Bruce Lee. He appears to be having a blast. I know I was."
ant-man,Fred Topel,True,"Jul 9, 2015","The Ant-Man movie is nonstop exposition up until the third act, so about 90 minutes. What fan of anything would want a whole movie explaining how it works? You want to see it in action, not spend the whole movie trying to convince nonbelievers."
ant-man,Kim Newman,False,"Jul 8, 2015","Extremely likable, with a few moments of proper wonder."
ant-man,Kevin Harley,False,"Jul 8, 2015","Reed might lack the pop-art pizzazz and unruly ambition Wright might have provided (yes, that's a lot of ""mights""...), but he nails the comedy/drama/action balance and slam-dunks the set-pieces."
ant-man,Chris Nashawaty,False,"Jul 8, 2015","Reed and Rudd's film is proof that no matter how silly some ideas sound at first, good things often do come in small packages."
ant-man,Mike Ryan,True,"Jul 8, 2015",Even with such a weird concept about a guy who can shrink and then communicate with ants ... there's way too much that feels familiar here.
ant-man,William Bibbiani,False,"Jul 8, 2015",Clunky and strange but refreshingly simple.
ant-man,Matt Singer,True,"Jul 8, 2015",As generic as comic-book movies come.
ant-man,Richard Lawson,True,"Jul 8, 2015","You can see, especially in that final, hilarious mêlée scene, where Ant-Man could have gone right. (Where it could have gone Wright?) But the film is too timid to fully take the wilder turns, to become its own distinct creature."
ant-man,Catherine Shoard,True,"Jul 8, 2015","Watching it is like channel-surfing between Hot Fuzz, a duff early 90s Michael Douglas drama and the very schlockiest bits of Interstellar."
ant-man,Roth Cornet,False,"Jul 8, 2015","Ant-Man works within the framework of the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe, but also delivers a streamlined, fast-paced, lively and -- frankly -- utterly charming story."
ant-man,David Ehrlich,True,"Jul 8, 2015","Even the jokes that do work leave some laughs on the table, and the impulse to play things safe proves emblematic of a film that shrinks in the face of a challenge."
ant-man,Alonso Duralde,True,"Jul 8, 2015",Serves up jokes that don't land and thrills that don't thrill.
ant-man,Jon Lyus,False,"Jul 8, 2015","Not only working as an out and out comedy, Ant-Man proves its originality by being the first heist movie included in the Marvel franchise."
ant-man,Matt Looker,False,"Jul 8, 2015",It all adds up to a film that is just so much brilliant funtimes.
ant-man,Rodrigo Perez,False,"Jul 8, 2015","Marvel's ""Ocean's Eleven"" meets ""Iron Man"" mélange does have its fleeting pleasures, but is ultimately a minor, milder MCU effort."
ant-man,David Jenkins,True,"Jul 8, 2015","There's no sensitivity, no eye for movement, no feeling for the way a camera can create emotion out of nothing, no heart beating beneath its celluloid skin."
ant-man,Mark Hughes,False,"Jul 8, 2015","Marvel has done it again... It's delightfully unexpected in its willingness to scale down, yet in doing so shows us how remarkable and important the smaller things in life truly are, after all."
ant-man,Simon Reynolds,False,"Jul 8, 2015","Free of the bloated running time we've come to expect from summer movies, it's a hugely entertaining superhero comedy that's a refreshing break from Marvel formula."
ant-man,Justin Chang,False,"Jul 8, 2015","Succeeds well enough as a genial diversion and sometimes a delightful one, predicated on the rarely heeded Hollywood wisdom that less really can be more."
ant-man,Tim Grierson,True,"Jul 8, 2015","Jokey rather than funny, and a bit forced when it's trying to be sincere, Ant-Man has plenty of enthusiasm but not a lot of inspiration, Reed unable to conceive the film in such a way that it establishes its own niche in the big-screen Marvel landscape."
ant-man,Todd McCarthy,False,"Jul 8, 2015","Although the story dynamics are fundamentally silly and the family stuff, with its parallel father-daughter melodrama, is elemental button-pushing, a good cast led by a winning Paul Rudd puts the nonsense over in reasonably disarming fashion."
ant-man,Jordan Hoffman,False,"Jul 8, 2015","[A] lesser entry in the Marvel series, but hardly microscopic."
ant-man,Eric Eisenberg,False,"Jul 8, 2015",A better than average caper with some really great performances and unique style that also further expands on the breadth of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
ant-man,Edward Douglas,False,"Jul 8, 2015",It could have been a lot worse and that in itself is a small miracle.
ant-man,Scott Mendelson,False,"Jul 8, 2015","Ant-Man is thematically thin, but it uses its small size to its advantage, crafting a winning comic adventure with spellbinding special effects."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Keith Garlington,False,"Aug 19, 2022",I ate up the funny banter between each unique superhero personality. I loved the large-scaled action which seemed ripped straight from the pages of a comic book. I was interested in the future movie tablesetting.
avengers-age-of-ultron,Don Shanahan,False,"Aug 14, 2022","Raising the stakes and swinging for the fences like a good film sequel should, Joss Whedon pays off the Phase 2 initiative with both a new level of groundbreaking effort and a continued dedication to the master blueprint of a grander big picture."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Brian Eggert,False,"Jun 21, 2022","If there's anything really wrong with Age of Ultron, it's the degree to which it leaves you yearning for more."

avengers-age-of-ultron,Therese Lacson,True,"Oct 9, 2021","It seems [Whedon] was willing to tell the story at all costs, regardless of faults within the narrative and the universe."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Nikki Baughan,False,"Oct 4, 2021",An electrifying cast under the guidance of Joss Whedon and a cool storyline are irresistible even for a less-than-enthusiastic superhero fan like me.

avengers-age-of-ultron,Mike Massie,True,"Dec 4, 2020","The enemies are merely repetitive opportunities for over-the-top, realism-devoid, gravity-defying stunts and action sequences to play out, one after the next."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Tony Asankomah,False,"Nov 20, 2020",For the first time ....The Avengers were in Africa. CGI effects were well done and show how technology is advancing.
avengers-age-of-ultron,Richard Propes,False,"Sep 2, 2020",Avengers: Age of Ultron is a film that occasionally lives up to that simultaneous nerdgasm.
avengers-age-of-ultron,Kelechi Ehenulo,False,"Jul 17, 2020",Avengers: Age of Ultron is a good film but may fall short of your high expectations.
avengers-age-of-ultron,Allen Almachar,False,"Jul 15, 2020","I had a lot of fun with this installment, I just wish it wasn't so concerned with reminding us that there's more to come in the years ahead."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Fiona Underhill,False,"Jul 12, 2020","It's a funny, fantastic movie with the Avengers dealing with internal conflict (not least the fact that Tony and Banner basically created said enemy). Also, it is a film which will have lasting and meaningful consequences on the MCU."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Brent McKnight,False,"Jul 6, 2020","Big, brash, and overcrowded, but entertaining enough to satiate fans."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Damond Fudge,False,"Jun 29, 2020","Age of Ultron is super fun. It successfully grows from the seeds planted by the first [Avengers film], fertilized by the individual experiences the characters have had in their own, stand-alone adventures."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Yasser Medina,False,"Jun 26, 2020","What is appealing with Avengers: Age of Ultron is that, although it does not surpass its predecessor [The Avengers] in narrative terms, it almost always looks for a new pace of entertainment. [Full review in Spanish]"

avengers-age-of-ultron,Chris McCoy,False,"Jan 10, 2020","It's a sprawling epic that represents the best work the corporate Hollywood studio system can produce. With Whedon's work, that's not damning with faint praise, it's just a statement of fact."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Siddhant Adlakha,False,"Dec 15, 2019","Avengers: Age of Ultron is a big ol' action beat-'em-up between superheroes and robots. It also uses genre trappings to dramatize the creation of God and the Devil, in order to tell a story about why we create, and why our stories matter."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Debbie Lynn Elias,False,"Dec 8, 2019",[A] non-stop thrill ride of action and entertainment.
avengers-age-of-ultron,Katie Smith-Wong,False,"Nov 19, 2019","Overall, Avengers: Age of Ultron is a fitting sequel - funny, action-packed and a lot more balanced."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Josh Wilding,False,"Sep 1, 2019","Avengers: Age of Utron is proof that Marvel can do no wrong, and as they continue to add new players to the table and reshape this world in a way which keeps it feeling exciting and fresh, the future looks brighter than ever for the MCU."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Leslie Combemale,False,"Aug 5, 2019","Whedon delivers an uneven, if entertaining second installment that, like many superheroes, has both great strengths and hidden weaknesses."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Ryan Syrek,False,"Jul 30, 2019","Another thing people only do to comic book movies is compare them to each other. Nobody walks out of a drama like Boyhood and says ""Now rank all the dramas."" Age of Ultron is fun, ephemeral summer fare. As lame-o Hawkeye says in the film ""that's our job."""
avengers-age-of-ultron,Mattie Lucas,True,"Jul 5, 2019",It was almost inevitable that the Marvel Cinematic Universe would one day bite off more than it can chew.
avengers-age-of-ultron,Christopher Preston,False,"May 10, 2019","Age of Ultron has gloomier veins and deeper belly laughs, but The Avengers was an event."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Danielle Solzman,False,"Apr 19, 2019",Avengers: Age of Ultron is the penultimate film of Marvel's Phase 2 and paves the landscape for phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
avengers-age-of-ultron,Richard Trenholm,False,"Apr 16, 2019","With its vast cast, ever-accelerating action and cameos from the wider Marvel world, it has to keep doubling down on spectacle as it races to its epic conclusion."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Bernard Boo,False,"Mar 14, 2019","In reality, it's nothing more than the action-packed culmination of three years-worth of superhero solo movies, and that's fine by me."

avengers-age-of-ultron,Ed Travis,False,"Mar 1, 2019","For every moment of disconnect and excess, there's a humanizing moment, a hilarious exchange, or a team up crowd pleaser"
avengers-age-of-ultron,Paula Fleri-Soler,False,"Feb 26, 2019",It is once more a delicate juggling act which Whedon performs with aplomb.
avengers-age-of-ultron,Amanda Greever,True,"Feb 5, 2019","The Avengers don't seem cohesive, and we have weird attempts at character development."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Micheal Compton,False,"Jan 23, 2019","There is a lot to like, but ultimately a lot to digest -- making its grand scale both a blessing and a curse."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Emmet Asher-Perrin,False,"Jan 9, 2019","[W]hatever its flaws, Age of Ultron is better than a roller coaster, and gives MCU fans plenty to chew on."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Abbie Bernstein,False,"Dec 19, 2018","The movie embodies what we want in a Marvel film - it's smart, cool, full of vivid stunts and effects with well-delineated characters played by top actors."
avengers-age-of-ultron,James Clay,False,"Dec 8, 2018","AGE OF ULTRON isn't going to exceed the expectations of the first Avengers' film, but, it will be one a helluva carnival ride."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Colby Bryant,False,"Dec 7, 2018","I respect Whedon for not attempting a retread, but not all of his risks pay off."
avengers-age-of-ultron,PJ Nabarro,False,"Nov 3, 2018","The return of the Avengers crew, though bringing little new to the table after the 2012 series opener, Avengers Assemble, is an amiable enough hokum diversion for 2+ hours."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Zaki Hasan,False,"Oct 31, 2018","it didn't blow me away like the first one, but that's probably understandable given that there wasn't the same ""Holy crap, it's an actual Avengers movie! I haven't wasted my life!"" factor at play."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Johnny Gayzmonic,False,"Oct 31, 2018","If the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a collectible card game, Avengers: Age Of Ultron is the best booster pack you could possibly get"
avengers-age-of-ultron,Kirsten Acuna,False,"Oct 30, 2018","As good as ""Age of Ultron"" is, it just leaves something to be desired. Still, you'll get the action you crave, you'll get some witty one-liners, and you'll have a really good time."

avengers-age-of-ultron,Leona Laurie,True,"Aug 29, 2018","By far the worst movie in the MCU. Also, Why must Ultron have lips?"
avengers-age-of-ultron,Molly Templeton,True,"Aug 28, 2018","Age of Ultron goes big - big cast, worldwide destruction, giant robot army - but in the end, it feels like very little happened."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Lisa Johnson Mandell,False,"Aug 22, 2018","the film is highly entertaining, and I don't want to acid rain on anyone's parade. If you like Mavel's Avengers, you'll love Age of Ultron. It's an extra large helping of more of the same, with a radioactive cherry on top."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Pamela Powell,False,"Aug 21, 2018","For the most part, it's a high energy action film, delivering what Marvel fans expect."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Keith Reid-Cleveland,False,"Jun 12, 2018","The biggest hurdle for movies that reach the levels of success that The Avengers did is repeating something close to it in a sequel. Age of Ultron may have missed the mark, but it wasn't by much."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Scott Huver,False,"May 17, 2018","[""Age of Ultron""] had some pretty big, overshadowing boots to fill, but ultimately, the movie certainly has the right stuff - flaws and all - to win the day."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Mark Keizer,False,"Mar 26, 2018","(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Andre Meadows,True,"Mar 2, 2018",There so many plots in this movie and so many scene that are JUST there to set up future movies...It moves too fast.
avengers-age-of-ultron,Sebastian Zavala Kahn,False,"Jan 31, 2018","It works on its own terms, proving Whedon's skill at managing an epic story full of different heroes and villains. [Full review in Spanish]"
avengers-age-of-ultron,Robert Kojder,False,"Dec 2, 2017","Hawkeye makes a self-aware remark that none of this makes any sense, and you know what, he's right. There's also nothing to be ashamed of; at the end of the day it's grand fun"

avengers-age-of-ultron,Matthew Bond,True,"Oct 30, 2017","Hardcore fans will find enough to enjoy here, but I found the pace at times slow, the visual effects somewhat disappointing (particularly compared to The Winter Soldier) and the story less than engrossing."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Sarah Marrs,False,"Oct 13, 2017","The chemistry between the Avengers grounds it. At heart, it's a story about friends and friendship. A completely bananas story about friends and friendship, featuring a murderous robot."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Joanne Soh,False,"Sep 20, 2017","Age Of Ultron will make fans jump for joy, especially when it comes to tying up the loose ends of Thanos and the Infinity Gauntlet that the earlier Marvel movies had teased about."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Brigit Grant,False,"Aug 22, 2017","With delectable James Spader voicing Ultron, a robotic artificial intelligence programme, and an opening sequence with The Avengers battling a terrorist group in a frozen wood, Whedon has more than delivered on his promise."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Brooke Corso,True,"Aug 16, 2017","At 141 minutes, the sequel is almost even in length with the original, so why does it feel so much longer?"
avengers-age-of-ultron,Eleanor Ringel Cater,True,"Jun 27, 2017",This blockbuster sequel has a plot more convoluted than the Biblical begats. Knowing that the New Yorker critic Anthony Lane was stumped as well makes me feel slightly better. But it didn't make the movie-going experience any more enjoyable.
avengers-age-of-ultron,Abby Olcese,False,"Jun 23, 2017","That Joss Whedon is able to address the changing beliefs and needs of each of the characters in Age of Ultron is impressive to say the least. That he does so in a way that feels believable is, well, pretty marvelous."

avengers-age-of-ultron,Dwight Brown,False,"Mar 7, 2017","There is little in this film that is new, but that doesn't matter. The characters are still entertaining, the action scenes thrilling and near orgasmic, and the human relationships touching."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Camilla Long,True,"Feb 28, 2017","It really, really feels like the 11th exhausting film in the unstoppable ring cycle of movies based on the Avengers comic-book heroes -- a vast and increasingly dull series of blockbusters planned out, terrifyingly, as far ahead as 2019."
avengers-age-of-ultron,David Fontana,False,"Feb 24, 2017","Convoluted, messy, and over-stuffed, The Avengers: Age of Ultron also somehow manages to be an incredibly enjoyable ride. Each of the actors bring their A-game, and each of their characters has their own moment to shine."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Gavia Baker-Whitelaw,False,"Oct 24, 2016","While we do get plenty of funny or touching interactions between the main characters, the film feels poorly structured and overly reliant on gigantic action sequences."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Sonny Bunch,False,"Jul 14, 2016","It's too bad Avengers: Age of Ultron lacks dramatic tension and has a more or less nonsensical plotline, because its component parts are frequently entertaining."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Tara Thorne,True,"Jul 11, 2016","It's as entertaining as holiday fireworks: initially exciting, which fades; then just loud, and finally the sense of time wasted because everything you just watched was pretty, but utterly meaningless."
avengers-age-of-ultron,James Hadfield,True,"Jun 15, 2016","Whedon has already announced that he won't be on board for the next installment, and you can hardly blame him. These films don't require a director. All they need are bean counters."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Jason Bailey,False,"May 28, 2016","Several thrilling action sequences, a great many good jokes, and an unshakable sense that everybody is just going through the paces."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Russell Baillie,False,"Apr 27, 2016","This Avengers is darker, louder, stranger and soapier than the first one."
avengers-age-of-ultron,J. Olson,False,"Apr 8, 2016","As a deliberate extension of multiple brands all at once, as the latest lily pad to Marvel's next big thing, it's a solid success, if not much in the way of an evolution."

avengers-age-of-ultron,Emine Yildirim,False,"Feb 29, 2016",It's exactly what it intends to be: popcorn entertainment.
avengers-age-of-ultron,Martin Roberts,False,"Feb 26, 2016","It's to his great credit that the film feels like a Joss Whedon film. In other words, it has a character of its own, and after 11 films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, that's something to enjoy and appreciate."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Jack Giroux,False,"Feb 23, 2016",Age of Ultron is almost exactly the movie you expect.
avengers-age-of-ultron,Nick Hasted,False,"Jan 2, 2016","Avengers: Age of Ultron may drag and creak during its 2 1/2 hours. But it's still often thrilling, briefly moving cinema."

avengers-age-of-ultron,Scott Beggs,False,"Dec 31, 2015",I can't think of a movie with a higher action to non-action ratio. Or maybe I just don't want to.
avengers-age-of-ultron,Sherilyn Connelly,True,"Dec 31, 2015","Loud, fluffy, and rather unsatisfying."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Cris Kennedy,False,"Dec 11, 2015","Technically, the film is excellent, with seamless CGI, and top-notch performances throughout, though moments are dark (literally, squinting-to-see dark)."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Alex Zane,False,"Dec 11, 2015","Keeping a monster of a blockbuster on the rails, Whedon delivers an epic slice of superhero cinema."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Ron Yamauchi,False,"Dec 11, 2015","If you don't already love costumed adventurers, this outing won't give you any fresh incentive, but fans will learn more about their heroes."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Nick Dent,False,"Dec 11, 2015","Whedon's strategy is to keep the action constant, the banter clever, and to switch between characters before we have time to think about anything too deeply. When it comes to engineering plot, he's a genius who could give Stark a run for his money."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Matthew Turner,False,"Dec 11, 2015","In short, this is a hugely entertaining, superbly made blockbuster that delivers everything you could want in terms of action, humour, character and emotion and won't disappoint fans of the first film. Highly recommended."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Nathaniel Rogers,False,"Dec 11, 2015","Age of Ultron's first act is basically one long doozy of a set piece, which manages to give us time alone with every principle character and give them some connective tissue in battle together, too."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Violet LeVoit,False,"Dec 2, 2015","Everything a popcorn movie should be, with a little Renaissance grandeur on the side."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Katherine Monk,True,"Nov 21, 2015","Director Joss Whedon takes a big stick to the over-stuffed piñata of Marvel Comics' characters and successfully empties out all the candy, but leaves a landscape strewn with plastic wrappers and the promise of a pounding headache"
avengers-age-of-ultron,Felix Vasquez Jr.,False,"Nov 19, 2015",A remarkable and often fantastic follow up...
avengers-age-of-ultron,Alex Leadbeater,False,"Sep 24, 2015",Is Avengers: Age Of Ultron the point where the Marvel Cinematic Universe goes too far? Hel no! But ... it's hard not to feel it somewhat missed the mark.
avengers-age-of-ultron,Beth Accomando,False,"Sep 11, 2015","Whedon delivers enough fun, action, and engaging team banter that fans will exit pleased but perhaps not giddy with joy."

avengers-age-of-ultron,Ben Skipper,False,"Sep 1, 2015","Whedon returns to assemble his team once more in Avengers: Age Of Ultron, and the results are at the same time familiar, different and as thrilling as ever before."
avengers-age-of-ultron,David 'Mad Dog' Bradley,False,"Sep 1, 2015","It scarcely needs to be said that there's a certain lack of freshness here, and some plot developments from the original graphic novels that we really didn't need - although, of course, there's also some seriously cool Avenger-ing too."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Robert Horton,False,"Sep 1, 2015","Writer/director Joss Whedon balances comedy and derring-do with dexterity, and this sequel to 2012's top grosser doesn't stall the franchise."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Neil Rosen,True,"Sep 1, 2015","Incredibly expensive action scenes full of destruction go on for way too long with little context behind them, leading to overkill and boredom."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Nandini Ramnath,False,"Sep 1, 2015","This time, it has become darker for the fanboys and a little more interesting for the rest of us."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Helen O'Hara,False,"Aug 17, 2015",This is a film that unfolds with every re-watch and reveals more subtle little grace notes.
avengers-age-of-ultron,Kristian M. Lin,False,"Aug 14, 2015","This sequel also represents Whedon's last go-around with the Marvel heroes, and while it succeeds in many ways, it's enough of a comedown to suggest that he's getting off the carousel at the right time."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Josh Terry,False,"Aug 5, 2015","Like the first film, what makes the sequel work is how director Joss Whedon builds the action on this character foundation and injects it with just enough humor to make its personality radiate."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Robert Horton,False,"Jul 13, 2015",It's possible to approve of how such a billion-dollar apparatus can be this fast and breezy.
avengers-age-of-ultron,Norman Wilner,False,"Jul 13, 2015",That isn't to say I didn't enjoy myself. I just didn't feel Marvel trying to do anything different this time around.
avengers-age-of-ultron,Tom Meek,True,"Jul 13, 2015","There's something to be had here, with such fine actors and seamless interlacing into a mega fantasy world, but overall the embarrassment of riches doesn't quite pay dividends."
avengers-age-of-ultron,David Nusair,True,"Jul 9, 2015","Avengers: Age of Ultron firmly confirms its place as the nadir of the Marvel cinematic universe - which is no small feat, certainly, given that the studio's output has been almost uniformly terrible."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Michael Smith,False,"Jun 22, 2015",Avengers: Age of Ultron is a pure popcorn-powered blast to begin the blockbuster season but nothing deeper this time.

avengers-age-of-ultron,Eric Melin,False,"Jun 12, 2015","Like Greek gods before them, superheroes are our modern myths, so why shouldn't they examine issues of the classic texts in our time? The end credit sequence actually gives this idea a visual corollary, as it shows a giant Hellenistic statue."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Linda Cook,False,"Jun 10, 2015","It's not so much what they do, it's what the Avengers say that makes ""Avengers: The Age of Ultron"" worth seeing on the big screen."

avengers-age-of-ultron,Bruce Bennett,False,"Jun 6, 2015","The previous film is arguably the best superhero film ever so there was nowhere for a sequel to go but down...Surely audiences know this, yet expectations were other-worldy."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Daniel Barnes,True,"May 30, 2015","Whedon is pretty much locked into an overarching storyline and a bland house style here, so instead of bucking the system, he dutifully serves up more of the same bubble-brained gibberish and wanton destruction."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Greg Maki,False,"May 29, 2015","... The fact that ""Age of Ultron"" succeeds at all, even if not to the extent of ""The Avengers,"" is a major achievement."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Paul Chambers,True,"May 28, 2015","The latest ""Avengers"" movie plays its music loud from start to finish. Mindless action rules, punctuated only by super hero/villain quips."
avengers-age-of-ultron,John Beifuss,False,"May 25, 2015","Isn't Tony Stark/Iron Man, stumping for 'a suit of armor around the world,' basically a combination Klaatu/Gort, endorsing the plan for an Earth-patrolling fascist robot army proposed by the alien visitor in 'The Day the Earth Stood Still'?"

avengers-age-of-ultron,Sean P. Means,False,"May 16, 2015","Whedon's dense script runs the risk of feeling bloated, but his deft handling of characters and pacing ensure that everybody is where they need to be, and the audience is always right there with them."

avengers-age-of-ultron,Christopher Lawrence,False,"May 8, 2015","The Avengers, we're told, are greater than the sum of their parts. Avengers: Age of Ultron is not. But it still boasts some pretty incredible parts. And one heck of a party."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Perry Simpson,False,"May 8, 2015","Age of Ultron is a minute shorter than its predecessor, but it's a bigger movie in nearly every other regard."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Poppy-Jay Palmer,False,"May 7, 2015","It's difficult to sit through Age Of Ultron without feeling like a child. It's fun, touching, exciting, funny, enthralling, moving and spectacular, and it makes the fact that it could be Whedon's last MCU adventure even more upsetting."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Steve Persall,False,"May 7, 2015","... a comic book movie frequently begging to actually be a comic book, with panels allowing readers to pause and pour over fantastic detail that Whedon whizzes by... battle-rattling our senses from start to anticlimactic finish."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Bob Grimm,True,"May 7, 2015",Feels like a bunch of those scenes Marvel usually reserves for the credits. It's more concerned about future films than the one it is actually in.

avengers-age-of-ultron,Richard Roeper,False,"May 4, 2015","""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe."

avengers-age-of-ultron,Robert Roten,False,"May 3, 2015","Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film."

avengers-age-of-ultron,Matt Brunson,False,"May 2, 2015","The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory."

avengers-age-of-ultron,Diva Velez,False,"May 1, 2015","Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in."

avengers-age-of-ultron,Neil Pond,False,"May 1, 2015","The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed."

avengers-age-of-ultron,Will Leitch,False,"May 1, 2015","Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution."

avengers-age-of-ultron,Brent McKnight,False,"May 1, 2015","The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much."

avengers-age-of-ultron,Jeffrey M. Anderson,False,"May 1, 2015","[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on ""Age of Ultron,"" he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's ""The Avengers."""

avengers-age-of-ultron,Rebecca Cusey,False,"May 1, 2015","You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Jonathan W. Hickman,False,"May 1, 2015","The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem."

avengers-age-of-ultron,Eric D. Snider,False,"Apr 30, 2015","It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an ""event"" every time it's on, you know?"

avengers-age-of-ultron,Randall King,False,"Apr 30, 2015","Juggling movie stars, plot points and a massive amount of visual effects, Whedon manages to put together a sequel that is fast and funny. But befitting the robot of the title, this feels more like a machine than a movie."

avengers-age-of-ultron,Andrew Lapin,True,"Apr 30, 2015","It is, in short, more disposable than the mere mortal blockbusters it was designed to outpace. This should defy Marvel Studios mathematics. How can a movie with more stuff than its predecessors be less fun?"

avengers-age-of-ultron,Tony Medley,True,"Apr 30, 2015","When this finally ended I had an appreciation for how it feels to be unjustly convicted of a crime...and be released after 10 years when it was discovered you were not guilty.

avengers-age-of-ultron,Emily St. James,False,"Apr 30, 2015","Not everything about Age of Ultron works... But long stretches of it are as good as anything Marvel Studios has produced, suggesting a bolder, more ambitious vision for the studio going forward."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Garth Franklin,False,"Apr 30, 2015","Though advertised as a darker and more brooding follow-up, the real surprise of Ultron is how much in line with the first film's tone and structural beats this is."

avengers-age-of-ultron,Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat,False,"Apr 30, 2015",A Marvel blockbuster with more human touches than usual for this kind of fare.
avengers-age-of-ultron,David Edelstein,False,"Apr 30, 2015",The amazing thing about Avengers: Age of Ultron is that it's reasonably enjoyable while feeling less like a movie than an epic sowing of seeds for multiple Marvel properties.
avengers-age-of-ultron,Anders Wright,False,"Apr 30, 2015","It's to Whedon's credit that, among all the fighting and property damage, he makes just enough time to focus on the personal lives of some of his characters, but not so much that the movie gets bogged down by it."
avengers-age-of-ultron,David Frese,False,"Apr 30, 2015",There's still a thrill in seeing all of these comic book characters together in a movie. Even when it's just Ulysses Klaw.
avengers-age-of-ultron,James Berardinelli,True,"Apr 30, 2015",Age of Ultron disappoints not because it's irredeemably bad but because it fails to achieve the level of its predecessor in nearly every facet.
avengers-age-of-ultron,Lisa Kennedy,False,"Apr 30, 2015","Whedon & Co. provide more than enough glib jokes, FX spectacles and sweet human insights to make Age of Ultron a popcorn must for the rest of us in need of a little comic-book wisdom right about now."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Joe Gross,False,"Apr 30, 2015","Whedon is still Whedon, and the grace notes -- the snappy patter, the team dynamics, the ""man, that was cool"" moments -- go a long way."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Peter Rainer,False,"Apr 30, 2015",Writer-director Joss Whedon attempts to inject just enough human drama into these noisy proceedings to keep it from turning into a Transformers-style crashathon.

avengers-age-of-ultron,Joe Williams,False,"Apr 30, 2015","""Age of Ultron"" has self-aware laughs, grandiose themes and the best effects that money can buy. But at this point, it will take true vision to plot the umpteen sequels without getting trapped in a time loop."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Steven D. Greydanus,False,"Apr 30, 2015","Whedon's wit and invention are considerable...[but] the movies keep getting bigger, with diminishing returns. I find myself hoping against hope that Ant-Man will be really, really small."

avengers-age-of-ultron,Richard von Busack,False,"Apr 30, 2015","Joss Whedon again works out a way to make world-destroying forces colloquial, keeping the humanity in superhumans. Because of that humanism-it's a pessimistic film, certain that the sun is setting on the human race-Ultron works as mammoth entertainment."

avengers-age-of-ultron,Rick Bentley,False,"Apr 29, 2015",The action scenes are spectacular. But the slightly jumbled story and mob of new characters pulls focus from what makes the film work the best -- the original group of costumed characters.
avengers-age-of-ultron,William Goss,False,"Apr 29, 2015",It is the product of a machine perfectly evolved for the sole purpose of annihilating boredom.
avengers-age-of-ultron,James Rocchi,True,"Apr 29, 2015","Like the worst superhero movies, Avengers: Age of Ultron often feels like not-very-bright kids playing with action toys, holding them up by the ankles and making them fight or kiss or feud at whim and at length."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Amy Nicholson,False,"Apr 29, 2015","A middling film, yet it's so heavy with Joss Whedon's sweat that it never feels like a lazy cash-in --- which for a preordained summer megahit is an accomplishment."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Scott Renshaw,False,"Apr 29, 2015","Sometimes the super-heroism is just brightly colored junk food. And sometimes, it's a way of giving us a glimpse of how we flawed, messed-up, occasionally monstrous humans can sometimes prove ourselves worthy."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Kenneth Turan,False,"Apr 29, 2015","It would be silly to pretend that Avengers: Age of Ultron isn't good at what it does, that it's not proficient at delivering superhero thrills for those who crave them most."

avengers-age-of-ultron,Ty Burr,False,"Apr 29, 2015","The climactic act of ""Age of Ultron"" is full of colossal ka-booms and special effects, but it also has heft and reason and a bass-note of emotion."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Brad Keefe,False,"Apr 29, 2015","It's a little overstuffed and a little overlong. One thing it's not, even a little, is disappointing."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Brian Orndorf,False,"Apr 29, 2015","Whedon has pulled off an impressive feat here, sustaining the intensity of a ripping adventure yarn while digging into a few of the characters a little more deeply, finding fresh ground to cover in a more satisfying epic."
avengers-age-of-ultron,CJ Johnson,True,"Apr 29, 2015","Darker than its predecessor [and] far less witty ... Whereas Stark seemed to dominate the first film, here the emphasis is ... Hawkeye and Black Widow ... a negative in the case of Hawkeye and a huge positive in the case of Black Widow."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Rene Rodriguez,False,"Apr 29, 2015",Age of Ultron is all rush and sensation with little substance. But what a feeling.
avengers-age-of-ultron,Lev Grossman,False,"Apr 29, 2015","Like the first one, Avengers: Age of Ultron was written and directed by Joss Whedon, among whose many virtues is an indelible, infallible touch with character, which is important because in Ultron he has to introduce them at a furious rate."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Carla Meyer,True,"Apr 29, 2015","Ultron is too full, of action and CGI, while also being nearly empty of genuine thrills. A talented cast impresses throughout, but the action ultimately overwhelms it."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Matthew Lickona,False,"Apr 29, 2015","Whedon is mostly up to the task of keeping all his balls in the air, though he's not above using some glib speechmaking and ridiculous action to divert your attention and keep your questions at bay."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Fred Topel,False,"Apr 29, 2015",This is Joss Whedon's riff on the trope of a darker sequel. Joss Whedon never met a cliche he couldn't deconstruct so this is a wonderful approach to a shared universe superhero team up.
avengers-age-of-ultron,Mick LaSalle,True,"Apr 29, 2015","""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is supercharged and lifeless, frenetic and stone-cold dead, a barrage of action scenes that look fake, yet make you wonder if fake is the new real."

avengers-age-of-ultron,Damien Straker,True,"Apr 28, 2015",Age of Ultron is a Western about military service: it's a call to arms to protect American values like the family and the home from East European types and electronic threats to security systems.
avengers-age-of-ultron,Edward Johnson-Ott,False,"Apr 28, 2015","[I] loved most of the exchanges between the characters. Appreciated the Avengers' attempts to avoid destruction in population centers. The action scenes were very exciting and clever, but I had trouble keeping up with the visuals."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Justin Gerber,True,"Apr 28, 2015","Joss Whedon sets up the future of the Avengers for the Russo Brothers, but this is no longer exciting. It's exhausting."

avengers-age-of-ultron,A.A. Dowd,False,"Apr 28, 2015","Whedon gets the elastic physical reality of comic books, and he knows how to frame a shot as though it were a splash panel come to life... But by the fifth digital showdown, the endless CGI spectacle begins to feel a little numbing."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Antonia Quirke,False,"Apr 28, 2015",Ultron is slyly funny. And it manages to balance this sort of comedy (I hooted when the Hulk listens to Maria Callas on headphones) with the tendency towards the sort of whacko-labyrinthine operatic complexity inherent in comic books.

avengers-age-of-ultron,Matt Zoller Seitz,False,"Apr 28, 2015","""Age of Ultron"" proves that a movie with stealth fighter jets, levitating cities and Hulk-on-robot fisticuffs can be as freewheeling as a no-budget indie."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Michael Phillips,False,"Apr 28, 2015","Entertaining as much of ""Avengers 2"" is, especially when it's just hanging out with the gang in between scuffles (the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" lesson, learned), Whedon's picture meets expectations without exceeding them."

avengers-age-of-ultron,Peter Canavese,False,"Apr 28, 2015","Pure, uncut comic-book fantasy...Whedon tames the beast into something spectacularly epic, if a bit exhausting: bursting with destructive mayhem but grounded by interesting character beats, rife with dark implications but seasoned with good humor."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Matt Prigge,True,"Apr 28, 2015",At times it feels like it's a few handfuls of terrific actors away from being a 'Transformers' entry.

avengers-age-of-ultron,Pete Hammond,False,"Apr 24, 2015",It suffers from a bit of Transformersitis in laying on the action and effects too thick this time.

avengers-age-of-ultron,Jason Best,False,"Apr 24, 2015","There are only so many superhero smackdowns a body can take before it all becomes biff bam bore... the film is most entertaining when it finds the Avengers kicking back rather than kicking off, hanging around off duty and indulging in locker-room banter ."
avengers-age-of-ultron,David Poland,True,"Apr 24, 2015","It was like Whedon thought about the 1st film and felt it wasn't deep enough, not realizing that its success was its comic book shallowness. It was just fun for audiences."

avengers-age-of-ultron,Peter Travers,False,"Apr 24, 2015","Whedon takes a few wrong turns, creating a jumble when the action gets too thick. But he recovers like a pro, devising a spectacle that's epic in every sense of the word."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Luke Buckmaster,True,"Apr 24, 2015","When movies such as this come along which feel more like financial investments than stories, that's what you get: production line filmmaking in which human beings are incidental and even unnecessary in the face of computer-generated scale and spectacle."

avengers-age-of-ultron,Jeremy Aspinall,False,"Apr 23, 2015","Although there are some longeurs when Whedon feels bound to plot a pathway to Marvel's next tranche of potential blockbusters, the witty repartee between stars at ease in their superhero skin leavens the odd lull."

avengers-age-of-ultron,Garry McConnachie,False,"Apr 23, 2015",Whedon wastes no time teaming them up for a blistering opening sequence that is thrilling. Unfortunately that segment is a high point in a film that swiftly becomes an exercise in ever-diminishing returns bar a few moments.

avengers-age-of-ultron,Jenna Busch,False,"Apr 23, 2015","The fact that Marvel announced its entire slate a few months back takes a lot of the impact away. If we didn't know about a Black Panther film, the mention of Wakanda would have been mind-blowing. Instead, it fell flat."

avengers-age-of-ultron,Stephen Lambrechts,False,"Apr 22, 2015","Avengers: Age of Ultron is a perfect example of the kind of crowd-pleasing blockbuster that audiences expect in this day and age, though I don't think it will achieve classic-status like the first film."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Blake Howard,False,"Apr 22, 2015","Whedon weaves theses titanic characters and egos together to bind the bloated universe into a Long Island Iced Tea; the more you savour, the more you come to appreciate all the powerful and seemingly conflicting elements and motivations working together."

avengers-age-of-ultron,Jim Vejvoda,False,"Apr 21, 2015","Ultimately, Avengers: Age of Ultron can't recapture the charm and majesty of seeing Earth's Mightiest Heroes assembled for the first time. That said, it's still a lot of fun and offers plenty of great action and character moments."
avengers-age-of-ultron,Robbie Collin,False,"Apr 21, 2015","The result is a lot of everything, but the film never feels overcrowded: in fact, it's the interplay between the film's many different characters, rather than the blow-up-the-world crisis they're trying to defuse, that keeps you on the edge of your seat."

avengers-endgame,Diane Pershing,False,"Jun 17, 2019","For those of us who have been there from the beginning, the three-plus hours went by without me once looking at my watch. I enjoyed how it delved more deeply into the characters with terrific back-and-forth banter of old friends."

avengers-endgame,Brandon Zachary,False,"Apr 25, 2019","It's nice to see how unafraid the film is being a finale; Endgame makes the franchise's history, and legacy, part of its story. The MCU will continue after this, but its current era feels finished in a fitting way."

avengers-infinity-war,Jonathan Romney,False,"May 3, 2018","The conclusion of Infinity War is so shocking because it doesn't feel like a cliffhanger, more like a drastic wiping clean of the slate before the whole cycle starts again, with whatever reversal of fortune or comprehensive reboot it may be."
avengers-infinity-war,Robert Roten,False,"May 3, 2018","The title of this movie should be 'Avengers: Infinity War Part One,' because that is what it is. It is not a movie that stands on its own. It is a leaning monolith that would fall flat without 'Part Two' to lean against."

So if the first installment of the two-part culmination of all that effort seems a bit loaded, I'd say other critics need to put their nitpicky hats away.

black-panther-wakanda-forever,Jeff Mitchell,True,"Nov 11, 2022","The Chadwick Boseman/T’Challa tributes are memorable and beautifully crafted, but ‘Wakanda Forever’ is cluttered, slow, and largely conversational (during the first two acts), as the story attempts to maneuver around its star’s passing."

black-panther-wakanda-forever,Samuel Leggett Jr.,False,"Nov 11, 2022","Wakanda Forever is easily the best Marvel film since Avengers: Endgame. The scope, the camera work, the acting, and the raw emotions on and off screen can be felt throughout! This is the Marvel I’ve missed! I had one word in my heart all night; “WOW…”"
black-panther-wakanda-forever,Jim Judy,False,"Nov 11, 2022","The action is handled decently and the special effects are top-notch, but it's the less ""exciting"" material that makes the film work, namely that of the aforementioned grief that pulses throughout the film."

black-panther-wakanda-forever,Kristian M. Lin,False,"Nov 11, 2022","It’ll be up to wearisome nerds like me to point out the sequel’s shortcomings, but I’ll also say the movie helps us grieve the actor and the character both taken from us too soon. Don’t underestimate what that means."

black-panther-wakanda-forever,Roger Friedman,True,"Nov 11, 2022","Unfortunately, “Wakanda Forever” is a movie with a hole at its center. Boseman’s T’Challa is gone, and the movie doesn’t know how to get around that problem."
black-panther-wakanda-forever,Katherine McLaughlin,False,"Nov 11, 2022",Single tears or floods of sobs performed by a clearly deeply affected cast are shown in close-up to convey pain and sorrow in such a raw manner that it’s difficult not to get invested in this epic and often breathtakingly arresting adventure.

black-panther-wakanda-forever,Graeme Tuckett,False,"Nov 10, 2022","As always with Marvel -- particularly these films -- the design, costuming and choreography are all stunning. The music, by Ludwig Göransson and many collaborators, is the first Marvel score I've been tempted to buy."

black-panther-wakanda-forever,Frank Swietek,True,"Nov 10, 2022","Can be admired for its ambition, but it’s grindingly melancholy, with no sense of joy: the crushing mood of grief, as well as the emphasis on pointless, murderous conflict, make it difficult to enjoy on an elemental superhero level."

black-panther-wakanda-forever,Danny Leigh,False,"Nov 10, 2022","Tragedy has always been an easy win for Marvel, laying waste to worlds so that chiselled heroes can gaze damp-eyed into the middle distance. Now, real life has shocked the glib out of the operation. For the first time... the tears actually mean something."
black-panther-wakanda-forever,Donald Clarke,True,"Nov 10, 2022","Wakanda Forever is, ultimately, a weary drag. It is as if the James Bond franchise had gone straight from Dr No to Moonraker in one leap (but with fewer jokes)."

black-panther-wakanda-forever,Brent Hankins,False,"Nov 8, 2022","Superhero films are rarely imbued with this level of emotional resonance and gravitas, and even though it doesn't reach the heights of the original Black Panther, it's still head and shoulders above the MCU's other post-Avengers: Endgame offerings."
black-panther-wakanda-forever,Jeffrey Lyles,False,"Nov 8, 2022",Wakanda Forever makes for an emotional farewell to Boseman while carefully constructing a new path for the franchise.
black-panther-wakanda-forever,Sean P. Means,False,"Nov 8, 2022","[It] doesn’t try to make us forget the noble T’Challa and his portrayer, Chadwick Boseman. But, by the end, you’re at least assured that his legacy is secure."
black-panther-wakanda-forever,Juanma Fernández París,False,"Nov 8, 2022","The film carries the unnecessary burden of setting up future projects with certain key characters.

black-panther-wakanda-forever,David Gonzalez,False,"Nov 8, 2022","An emotionally powerful and cathartic cinematic journey of loss, grief, and moving forward. Tenoch Huerta, Angela Bassett, and Letitia Wright are the vibranium of the film: magnetic, powerful, and lasting."
black-panther-wakanda-forever,A.A. Dowd,False,"Nov 8, 2022","Why, with most of the old pieces in place, does Wakanda Forever feel—as so many sequels before it have—like it's reflecting the magic of its predecessor rather than entirely recapturing it?"
black-panther-wakanda-forever,Nell Minow,False,"Nov 8, 2022","This is a movie that would make T’Challa proud, and it is a worthy tribute to Boseman and to the Marvel writers and artists who first envisioned Wakanda and made us all want it to go on forever."

black-panther-wakanda-forever,Wendy Lee Szany,False,"Nov 8, 2022","A powerful tribute to Chadwick Boseman. Stellar and emotional performance by the cast.

black-panther-wakanda-forever,Ron Seoul-Oh,False,"Nov 8, 2022","Somehow Coogler and the returning cast of Letitia Wright, Lupita Nyong’o, Danai Gurira, Angela Bassett and Winston Duke did it, creating a film that is emotional, enthralling and most of all, unapologetic."
black-panther-wakanda-forever,Richard Lawson,False,"Nov 8, 2022","There is much to be admired here, a care for craft and detail on a higher plane than other Marvel fare.

black-panther-wakanda-forever,Justin Chang,False,"Nov 8, 2022",It’s telling that both the first “Black Panther” and this messier if seldom less engrossing follow-up are at their strongest when they resist or even flat-out ignore their franchise obligations.
black-panther-wakanda-forever,K. Austin Collins,False,"Nov 8, 2022",The movie isn’t always on such sure footing. But that’s almost appropriate: a messier movie trying to reckon with a messier range of feelings.

black-panther-wakanda-forever,Grace Randolph,False,"Nov 8, 2022",A fantastic sequel about grief and true leadership with Shuri's journey. Ryan Coogler handles the passing of Chadwick Boseman quite well. Plus Namor is a fantastic addition with the MCU! One of Marvel's best.
black-panther-wakanda-forever,Kirsten Acuna,False,"Nov 8, 2022","While full of breathtaking visuals, a few truly shocking moments, and another Grammy-worthy soundtrack from Ludwig Göransson, the sequel wastes a decent portion of its lengthy two-hour-and-41-minute runtime on setting up spin-offs."

black-panther-wakanda-forever,Aaron Perine,False,"Nov 8, 2022","Through the collective efforts of a cast intent on doing right by the man who started it all, the film percolates with purpose.

black-panther-wakanda-forever,Germain Lussier,False,"Nov 8, 2022","That Black Panther: Wakanda Forever works completely defies logic. The film juggles so many storylines, so many characters, and so many emotions... it’s seemingly too much for any one movie to handle, but Wakanda Forever does it."
black-panther-wakanda-forever,David Ehrlich,False,"Nov 8, 2022","For all of the film’s shuddery pacing... Coogler’s subthread of the MCU continues to operate at a significantly higher strata of thought, artistry, and feeling than the rest of Marvel’s assembly line."

black-panther,Namwali Serpell,False,"Feb 22, 2018","Rather than reflecting or distorting a world, this technology builds a world and then lets it fall away.

black-panther,Esau McCaulley,False,"Feb 22, 2018",Killmonger is such a compelling antagonist because audiences are left to wonder whether to see him as a criminal or the inevitable outcome of society's past sins.

black-panther,Robert Roten,False,"Feb 21, 2018","This is a big budget film directed by a black man, with a black superhero and a largely black cast. This kind of black power is something so rare in movies that it seemed like I was watching a foreign film, made in Wakanda, rather than Hollywood."

black-panther,CJ Johnson,False,"Feb 21, 2018","It's very long, but, unlike some of the Marvel movies, it's neither bloated nor convoluted. Instead, it's proud ... Thankfully there aren't a lot of references to other Marvel properties. Iron Man doesn't zip in and save the day. Can you imagine?"
black-panther,Luis Martínez,False,"Feb 20, 2018","It is paradoxical that both Letitia Wright and Lupita Nyong'o and, above all, the villain embodied by Michael B. Jordan, look more and are better than Black Panther himself. [Full Review in Spanish]"

black-panther,Aine O'Connor,False,"Feb 18, 2018","I confess to superhero fatigue but this diversity fest is refreshing -- it takes on race and gender, it's quite serious, both in terms of politics and lack of humour, but it is well made by director Ryan Coogler, [and] has lots of action and heart."

black-panther,Udita Jhunjhunwala,False,"Feb 17, 2018","The special effects, sets, costumes, music and production design are bombastic and overpowering at times.

black-panther,Anthony Lane,False,"Feb 16, 2018","Jordan has swagger to spare, with those rolling shoulders, but there's a breath of charm, too, all the more seductive in the overblown atmosphere of Marvel. He's twice as pantherish as the Panther."
black-panther,Peter Sobczynski,False,"Feb 16, 2018","Black Panther is more than good enough and not only does it live up to those sky-high expectations, it pretty much exceeds them.

black-panther,Armond White,True,"Feb 16, 2018","Black Panther turns racial politics into what Malcolm X called ""politricks"" . . . The media's enthusiasm for this bland action flick is maddening. The problem isn't one particular movie, but the celebration of the illusion of ""progress."""

black-panther,Rob Carnevale,False,"Feb 15, 2018",It is a landmark moment in blockbuster cinema that couldn't be more timely or more confident in its ability to be so.
black-panther,Ryan Gilbey,False,"Feb 15, 2018","[The] script adheres to the usual genre formula of tomfoolery, in-jokes, mythology and outright poppycock, but their knack for teasing emotional resonance out of standard scenarios gives them the edge over predecessors and competitors alike."
black-panther,Dustin Putman,False,"Feb 15, 2018","Destined to be celebrated, and for good reason; this may not be the first film featuring a black superhero, but it is groundbreaking all the same for being the first of this scale."
black-panther,Brad Keefe,False,"Feb 15, 2018","It's more than just an overdue step of onscreen representation. It's also a rollicking good blockbuster, even if it doesn't quite reinvent the wheel."
black-panther,Maren Longbella,False,"Feb 15, 2018","""Black Panther"" is so worth the hype."
black-panther,Radheyan Simonpillai,False,"Feb 15, 2018","A beautiful, hallucinatory sequence, as Killmonger reaches peak villain and assumes his powers, is the most dramatically fraught and heart-wrenching moment in any Marvel movie."

black-panther,Jonathan W. Hickman,False,"Feb 15, 2018","Forget a lethal presidential Twitter account, King T'Challa has drank some kind of tea made from a Heart-Shaped Herb enabling him to take on an army.

black-panther,Rob Hunter,False,"Feb 15, 2018","Like the best blockbusters it's flawed but ridiculously entertaining anyway, and like too few of them it's also so incredibly important."
black-panther,Michelle Alexandria,False,"Feb 15, 2018",Michael B. Jordan gives a hell of a performance. Maybe people will stop blaming him for FF and give him his due. Killmonger is one of the best characters Marvel has ever created. Stop using the Race card to promote this film.

black-panther,Robert Kojder,False,"Feb 15, 2018","If Wakanda, invisible to the naked eye yet brimming with futuristic technology that could better the entire planet, is a beautifully depicted metaphor for representation, then Killmonger is a manifestation of African-American pain past and present"
black-panther,Matt Donato,False,"Feb 15, 2018","Black Panther proves how representation can rejuvenate even the oldest superhero origin arcs, allowing Marvel a victory that still feels every bit a Ryan Coogler film."

black-panther,Joe Gross,False,"Feb 14, 2018","In Black Panther, Coogler and company have made a superhero picture that's twice as good, twice as smart, twice as fun to look at as any before it. May they get twice the credit and twice the box office."

black-panther,Kristian M. Lin,False,"Feb 14, 2018",The results are astonishing.
black-panther,Chris Knight,False,"Feb 14, 2018","Between Black Panther's Black Lives Matter subtext and its use of female characters as more than window dressing both in front of and behind the camera ... it seems as though Hollywood has, for one shining moment, caught up with the real world."

black-panther,Joanne Soh,False,"Feb 14, 2018","Letitia Wright steals the thunder as T'Challa's younger sister and Wakanda's tech and weapons genius. I would love to see her and Tony Stark in the same room, just to watch them out-geeking each other."

black-panther,Dann Gire,False,"Feb 14, 2018",These are no small ideas. This cogent screenplay serves up the obligatory superhero trappings -- but it addresses real-world issues of global propriety and responsibility with an underlying sense of gravity.
black-panther,Dom Sinacola,False,"Feb 14, 2018",Black Panther might be the first MCU film that could claim to most clearly be an expression of a particular director's voice.
black-panther,Peter Canavese,False,"Feb 14, 2018","Boilerplate Marvel, with a sleek, colorful look, cheeky humor, and familiar action beats...But Coogler brings enough to the table for a fresh vision, broadly appealing as well as inspirational in its representation for black audiences and women."

black-panther,Mick LaSalle,False,"Feb 14, 2018","Chadwick Boseman commands every moment of this film, radiating probity and purpose, and it's only later on that you realize that, with another actor, this wouldn't have been a sure thing."

black-panther,Moira MacDonald,False,"Feb 14, 2018","Coogler is a young filmmaker - this is just his third feature, following ""Fruitvale Station"" and ""Creed"" (two fine and very different films) - but he marshals this world with confidence and flair."

black-panther,Steve Persall,False,"Feb 14, 2018","Coogler delivers action with frenetic grace, keeping the violence more intimate than usual for a superhero movie. Less soulless metropolis crumbling and more face-to-face combat (although the armored rhinos aren't bad)."

black-panther,Stephen Romei,False,"Feb 14, 2018","Even if you are not a fan of superhero movies you may find the issues explored thought provoking. It is also action packed, well acted, dazzlingly shot by English cinematographer Rachel Morrison and... full of humour and self-aware wisecracks."

black-panther,Mara Reinstein,False,"Feb 14, 2018",Ryan Coogler has eschewed the familiar Marvel glut of smug in-jokes and mind-numbing CGI explosions to create a visually dazzling work of art.
black-panther,Shyama Krishna Kumar,False,"Feb 14, 2018","It's the kind of art that's aggressively theatrical, but not even for a moment does it feel performative."

black-panther,Cary Darling,False,"Feb 14, 2018","Visually, ""Black Panther"" is often spectacular...It's warriors with spears and force-field shields. It's aircraft that soar and swoop like birds over the Serengeti. It's ""Blade Runner"" in Dar es Salaam instead of L.A."

black-panther,Jim Slotek,False,"Feb 14, 2018","A Shakespearean flavoured tragedy to its backstory, with palace intrigue and hidden secrets. Where Serkis's maniacally-laughing Klaue is a bad guy who wears thin, Killmonger is one of the few movie villains I've ever felt sorry for."

black-panther,Rick Bentley,False,"Feb 8, 2018","Unlike a Tony Stark who can entertain with his dry wit or Captain America who dazzles with his passion for patriotism, Boseman must play both T'Challa as a man of great reserve. He's a warrior, but one who rules the screen with a quiet calm."
black-panther,Stephen Rebello,False,"Feb 8, 2018","Looking, sounding and feeling the way it does-wearing its anti-corporate, anti-fascist, anti-racist heart on its sleeve-it's a movie that, for sure, knows what's up."
black-panther,Tobi Akingbade,False,"Feb 8, 2018","But what no trailer could prepare us for is director Ryan Coogler's skills at perfectly weaving socio-political lessons on love, culture community, isolation, personal responsibility and identity in between some pretty dope fight scenes."

black-panther,Ed Power,True,"Feb 7, 2018","Black Panther spirals into a stodgy tale of internecine feuding, in which T'Challa is required to come to terms with the sins of past generations. What he doesn't get to do much of is jump around beating-up bad guys. That's a shame."

black-panther,Sandra Hall,False,"Feb 7, 2018","... it's a very rich buffet - geopolitical thriller, futuristic fantasy, coming-of-age story, African adventure with mystical overtones... it offers a wide variety of tastes and sensations but they never really come together to form a satisfying whole."

black-panther,David Kaplan,False,"Feb 7, 2018","The set designs are extraordinary, and the movie features a surprise ending --- especially for those who left the theatre prematurely --- with a timely message about international togetherness."
black-panther,Cameron Williams,False,"Feb 7, 2018","Proves a Marvel film can aspire to be something more; it has political bite, emotional depth, ethical dilemmas, and regal jostling, but it still manages to maintain a bombastic comic book aesthetic that's spectacular."

black-panther,Mark Hughes,False,"Feb 6, 2018","[A] tour de force, one of the smartest, most original action-packed blockbusters of the decade... bold and visually stunning filmmaking..."

black-panther,Kristian Harloff,False,"Feb 6, 2018","He is just getting better and better and knows how to develop characters in this emotional way that you're invested...this guy is a rising star. As great as every single actor is in this movie, Ryan Coogler, once again, is the star of this film."
black-panther,Tim Grierson,False,"Feb 6, 2018","Part spy thriller, part all-out battle and part social commentary, ""Black Panther"" is consistently propelled by tonal and thematic flourishes that break with the conventions that have defined the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
black-panther,Katherine McLaughlin,False,"Feb 6, 2018","The incredibly stellar cast is led by a majestic Chadwick Boseman, reprising the role of T'Challa and finding him at a cross-roads in his life."
black-panther,Emma Simmonds,False,"Feb 6, 2018","Yet it's The Walking Dead's Gurira who steals the show as the ferocious Okoye, gloriously swinging her spear in a billowing red gown."
black-panther,Liz Braun,False,"Feb 6, 2018",Black Panther is every bit as good as you were hoping. Actually -- it's better. A terrific screenplay from Ryan Coogler and Joe Robert Cole elevates this thing way beyond the usual boundaries of the Marvel Universe.
black-panther,Rodrigo Perez,False,"Feb 6, 2018","Once ""Black Panther"" gets out of its crouching position and goes on a sprint, it's an engaging ride that rarely lets up."
black-panther,David Ehrlich,False,"Feb 6, 2018","You believe in T'Challa, you believe in Wakanda, and you believe - maybe for the first time - that the MCU actually matters."
black-panther,Jake Coyle,False,"Feb 6, 2018",It's easy to lament how long it took to bring Black Panther to the big screen. But at least the wait was worth it.
black-panther,Jason Guerrasio,False,"Feb 6, 2018","Like ""Wonder Woman"" last year, ""Black Panther"" is a project that fans have been waiting decades to see. And just like ""Wonder Woman,"" it was worth the wait."
black-panther,Haleigh Foutch,False,"Feb 6, 2018","Production design, costumes, and of course, visual effects are all on point, and newly minted Oscar-nominee Rachel Morrison shoots every frame to embrace the sumptuous detail."

black-panther,Brian Lowry,False,"Feb 6, 2018","Black Panther pounces toward the head of the class in a way that should make the King, and his key subjects, a cornerstone of an already-formidable roster."
black-panther,Don Kaye,False,"Feb 6, 2018","The initial Twitter responses hailing it as a ""masterpiece"" go way overboard... [but Coogler] assembled one of the finest acting lineups ever recruited for a Marvel movie--or any genre outing, for that matter."
black-panther,Angie Han,False,"Feb 6, 2018","Black Panther perfects what the Marvel Cinematic Universe has always done so well: build a world so richly rendered, it's almost a letdown to reach the end of the film and realize it's time to return to our own reality."
black-panther,Olive Pometsey,False,"Feb 6, 2018","Black Panther isn't just levelling out representation in Hollywood, it's inspiring the next generation of real-life heroes, and that's what makes this film truly magnificent."

black-panther,Robbie Collin,False,"Feb 6, 2018",You can see [Michael B.] Jordan offhandedly weighing the line in his mind like a rock he's about to lob: it's one of many nicely judged moments of performance here from a wildly appealing ensemble cast without a weak link.
black-panther,Courtney Howard,False,"Feb 6, 2018","Not only does it live up to the expected levels of epic exhilaration, it surpasses them, digging its claws into real-world social and political profundity."

black-panther,Alonso Duralde,False,"Feb 6, 2018","When ""Black Panther"" works, it's thrillingly alive."
black-panther,Kevin Maher,False,"Feb 6, 2018","The director Ryan Coogler and a charismatic cast... turn racial clichés on their head and drag in some heavy Shakespearean conflict to create a vivid yarn that's entirely new, frequently startling and, at every step along the way, all Marvel."
black-panther,Kenneth Turan,False,"Feb 6, 2018","We didn't know we'd been yearning for it until it arrived, but now that it's here it's unmistakable that the wait for a film like ""Black Panther"" has been way longer than it should have been."

black-panther,Manohla Dargis,False,"Feb 6, 2018",Most big studio fantasies take you out for a joy ride only to hit the same exhausted story and franchise-expanding beats. Not this one.
black-panther,Conner Schwerdtfeger,False,"Feb 6, 2018","Ryan Coogler's Black Panther is one of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's most powerful, moving, and thematically resonant films to date. It's also one of its most uneven, when all is said and done."

black-panther,Joelle Monique,False,"Feb 6, 2018","Played by Letitia Wright, Shuri is a revelation. Wright steals every scene with her bright smile and perfect comedic timing."

black-panther,Marc Bernardin,False,"Feb 6, 2018","As a nerd and as a black man, I've been waiting for this movie for my entire life, whether I knew it or not. The fact that Black Panther gets so much right, but one crucial thing wrong, is both thrilling and maddening."

black-panther,Jimi Famurewa,False,"Feb 6, 2018","A giddily enjoyable, convention-bucking 134-minute epic that somehow manages to simultaneously be a comic-book blockbuster, a pulsating espionage thriller and an Afro-futurist family saga."
black-panther,Bryan Bishop,False,"Feb 6, 2018","It's gripping, funny, and full of spectacle, but it also feels like a turning point, one where the studio has finally recognized that its movies can be about more than just selling the next installment."

black-panther,Clay Cane,False,"Feb 6, 2018","Innovative, intelligent and empowering. When I was younger, all we had was Billy Dee Williams in Star Wars. Black and brown children need a movie like Black Panther to boost their imagination and help them to dream the impossible."

black-widow,Zach Pope,False,"Jul 26, 2023","It’s a near perfect prequel & in everyway dives deep into a character that has been the heart of the avengers for awhile. 
It might be a little too late & this film should of come right after Civil War…. But still with its heart"
black-widow,Manuel São Bento,False,"Jul 25, 2023","Black Widow beautifully honors the iconic Natasha Romanoff, who finally receives the respectful, worthy solo film that her unforgettable legacy always deserved. Scarlett Johansson shines one last time."
black-widow,David Gonzalez,False,"Jan 31, 2023","Black Widow is both complex and engaging as its focus on familial relationships leads to some of the most memorable moments thanks to its ensemble and, in turn, creates new characters for Marvel’s team to play with in their billion-dollar sandbox."
black-widow,Joseph Garcia,False,"Jan 8, 2023","Natasha and Yelena are... kicking *ss, getting dirty, and ribbing on each other for posing while fighting. But [they're] also compassionate enough to share a hug and cry. To me, this is the best female-led film in the superhero genre."
black-widow,Tom Shone,True,"Dec 6, 2022","Pugh is fabulous, by a long mile the best thing in the film, and for a few brief scenes it flares into life as that rare Marvel movie with no aspirations above street level."

black-widow,Zoë Rose Bryant,False,"Sep 1, 2022",Black Widow is a fitting finale for star Scarlett Johansson that simultaneously sets up captivating new characters to carry on her legacy.
black-widow,Keith Garlington,False,"Aug 17, 2022",The mostly self-contained story packs a surprising amount of heart and finally gives this long-running MCU character a proper send off.
black-widow,Erick Estrada,True,"Jul 21, 2022",There isn't a real opportunity for these big name stars to interact in an interesting way. [Full review in Spanish]
black-widow,Scott Phillips,False,"Jul 21, 2022","I tend to judge each new MCU installment by one simple criteria: was it entertaining? When it comes to Black Widow, my answer is Yes."
black-widow,Michael Curley,True,"Jun 10, 2022","Marvel Studios’ Black Widow was too little, too late for the MCU’s most popular female character..."
black-widow,Jessie Gender,True,"May 30, 2022","A lukewarm farewell to a character who never got to take center stage when she deserved to, and this film feels too-little, too late as a result."
black-widow,Jimmy Cage,False,"Mar 13, 2022","BLACK WIDOW is Marvels take on a somewhat silly, over-the-top retro Bond movie. Certainly not great cinematic art, but really entertaining and with a wonderful cast."
black-widow,Jeffrey Harris,False,"Mar 8, 2022","While far from being one of the best installments of the MCU, Black Widow is still a fairly decent outing, propelled by spirited performances by Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pughs characters."
black-widow,Victoria Luxford,False,"Mar 2, 2022","A Marvel film that is happy to be its own self-contained adventure. If this came in the build-up to Infinity War, it might have got lost in the shuffle. However, after two years away from the big screen, Johansson brings the universe back with style."
black-widow,Carson Timar,False,"Feb 22, 2022","For fans who simply want to see this character one more time on the big screen getting her long-deserved moment, the film delivers perfectly adequately."
black-widow,Collin Garbarino,False,"Feb 17, 2022","Marvel fans have longed for the release of Black Widow, the latest installment in the Avengers franchise, since at least 2015. Though its not perfect, many fans will consider this feminine superhero movie worth the wait."
black-widow,Wesley Lovell,False,"Feb 12, 2022","That said, if any film had to reinvigorate the box office for audiences, Im glad its this one, which proves once again to the risk-averse Disney that having a female protagonist can actually succeed."
black-widow,Jeff Nelson,True,"Feb 12, 2022","After fans have been waiting so long for Black Widow to get a solo film, it feels like a bit of a letdown for her to get overshadowed by a new character in her own film."
black-widow,Karen Rought,False,"Dec 20, 2021","Not only do we continue to see Natasha's physical prowess, but we also get to witness a more emotional side to the character. This was as much Pugh's movie as Johansson's."
black-widow,Cate Young,False,"Nov 5, 2021",But the bigger problem with the film is that it suffers from the girlboss-ification of female characters that has seeped into media over the few years.
black-widow,Julia Swift,False,"Oct 30, 2021",A fabulous director and two awesome stars battle their way through a wonky script.
black-widow,Damien Straker,True,"Oct 29, 2021","While it improves in the second half, Black Widow is too uneven and generic to recommend. Telling a story about freewill and liberation is ironically littered with too many artistic compromises."

black-widow,Andrew Kendall,False,"Oct 26, 2021","Johansson is good, better than she's been given the opportunity to be before with this role, but she - like Black Widow is still stunted in many ways by the vision the MCU has for Natasha which makes this feel more elegiac than energetic."

black-widow,Tatat Bunnag,True,"Oct 8, 2021",Natasha deserved a better memorial.
black-widow,Witney Seibold,True,"Oct 7, 2021",Bland spy hooey. Although Pugh is a standout.
black-widow,Chris Sawin,False,"Oct 6, 2021","Black Widow is worth seeing for Florence Pugh, the free-fall action sequence, and anything involving Taskmaster before it's revealed who is under the mask. The film mostly feels like it was done better by the films it was supposedly influenced by."
black-widow,Don Shanahan,False,"Oct 2, 2021",The rawness made for a spirited episode that every Marvel fan needs to listen to.
black-widow,Victor Pineyro,False,"Sep 30, 2021","It would've been amazing to receive this movie 4 years ago, now it's just too late. That doesn't mean it's not a worthy closure for a much beloved character. [Full review in Spanish]"
black-widow,Matt Hudson,False,"Sep 23, 2021",The positives do outweigh the negatives but it does frustratingly end up feeling middle-of-the-road in terms of the MCU output.
black-widow,David Walsh,True,"Sep 13, 2021",Black Widow is not as tedious and self-serious an entry as some of them. But that is setting the bar low.
black-widow,Mark Daniell,False,"Sep 10, 2021",What ensues is a film that isn't interested in planting seeds for future Marvel movies -- which is actually a refreshing change of pace.
black-widow,Akhil Arora,True,"Sep 3, 2021",Pugh is the only victory for this vanilla Marvel movie. [...] Fans are left wondering what could have been. And Johansson is left fighting a lawsuit against the world's biggest entertainment behemoth - a mission that seems too much even for Natasha.
black-widow,Rohan Naahar,True,"Sep 3, 2021",Black Widow achieves the unthinkable and dethrones Thor: The Dark World as the worst film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
black-widow,Zehra Phelan,True,"Aug 31, 2021","The spotlight should firmly be on her, or so you would have thought, but for all its acrobatic female kick-ass baddery poor old Natasha Romanoff has to share that limelight with her highly skilled ""family"" to bring down the patriarchy."
black-widow,Steven D. Greydanus,True,"Aug 28, 2021",Almost completely lacking in Black Widow is any sense of outrage over the grotesque violations of human rights and human dignity at the root of the whole premise of the film.
black-widow,Ian Thomas Malone,True,"Aug 23, 2021","The problem with Black Widow is that the whole ordeal feels like an obligatory afterthought, simply going through the motions with only a perfunctory sense of charm."
black-widow,Paul Whitington,False,"Aug 20, 2021","Black Widow has everything going on: dysfunctional families, sibling rivalry, a fatuous Russian superhero, a cackling Bond villain and an army of female assassins. What more do you want?"

black-widow,Damian Levy,False,"Aug 12, 2021","While humour is an important part of the film, it's used to serve the tragic story rather than undercut it."
black-widow,David Nusair,False,"Aug 12, 2021","...a relatively watchable endeavor that benefits from its agreeable, entertaining performances..."
black-widow,Rubén Rosario,True,"Aug 10, 2021","Diehard fans will likely find Easter eggs and winking references to Marvel Comics and MCU content to pore over, but other moviegoers should be able to call this stultifying slog what it is: a terrible film and a waste of a good cast."

black-widow,James Berardinelli,True,"Aug 6, 2021","Black Widow represents the MCU looking back when it should be moving forward. Everything about the movie seems small, even the big action set-pieces"

black-widow,Tiffie Starchild,False,"Aug 6, 2021",Marvel was still able to work their magic to make this a movie to get people invested.
black-widow,Brad Keefe,False,"Aug 6, 2021","Black Widow still is a refreshing spy thriller that delivers action that doesn't depend on superpowers, and MCU exploring tangential stories less tied to a big arc creates opportunity."
black-widow,Luke Parker,True,"Aug 4, 2021","Romanoff's positioning against a flagrant misogynist, combined again with the delayed timing of her long-awaited solo film, may feel dangerously close to tokenism."
black-widow,John McDonald,True,"Aug 1, 2021","This celebration of the nuclear family - a completely phoney nuclear family - is relentless. They're killers but also big softies, who look back nostalgically on those happy days spent undercover in Ohio."

black-widow,Bruce R. Miller,False,"Jul 31, 2021","""Black Widow"" spins an awfully good web."
black-widow,Eileen Jones,True,"Jul 30, 2021",Black Widow is a dumb movie that recycles the same Russophobic Cold War narrative Hollywood has been using for years. But it's just dopey enough and supplies just enough laughs that I couldn't be mad at it.
black-widow,Matt Neal,False,"Jul 30, 2021","An origin story without totally playing out like one, but also a hard-punching spy thriller with a strong central theme."
black-widow,Andrea Thompson,False,"Jul 30, 2021","At least it seems the baton is being passed to Pugh, who not only effortlessly holds her own opposite Johansson, but breathes life and emotion to her every role."
black-widow,Deborah Ross,True,"Jul 29, 2021","More women is its only decent idea. Otherwise, it's business as usual. Otherwise, it's all formulaic bish-bosh, smash-crash action scenes broken up by lame jokes and lame philosophising along the lines of: ""Your pain only makes you stronger."""
black-widow,Dan Buffa,False,"Jul 29, 2021",Cate Shortland's biggest feat here is taking a larger-than-life world and grounding it in high-stakes thriller fashion. It also gives Johansson the deserving spotlight.
black-widow,Tom Beasley,False,"Jul 29, 2021","Not only is it a thrilling couple of hours at the cinema, it well and truly anoints Pugh as Marvel's next bona fide megastar."

black-widow,Brandon Collins,False,"Jul 29, 2021",This was a very effective action thriller that provided some closure to this character in an endearing way. Also Florence Pugh killed this!
black-widow,Robert Roten,False,"Jul 26, 2021",What makes this movie stand out from the majority of action movies is that it is more character-driven than most. It is about family relationships as much as it is about the mission.
black-widow,Tony Black,False,"Jul 26, 2021",Black Widow unintentionally feels of a simpler time for this expansive universe. It should have been made five years ago.
black-widow,Sara Michelle Fetters,False,"Jul 26, 2021","Shortland does a solid job with the material, but even she isn't able to entirely gloss over how Natasha randomly keeps disappearing in her own movie or how what is supposed to be her story frequently focuses on other characters."
black-widow,Rosa Parra,False,"Jul 24, 2021",Brings a much-needed complexity to Natasha Romanoff giving her a well-deserved farewell. Pugh stands out as Yelena & provides a promising future for this franchise.

black-widow,Matthew Pejkovic,True,"Jul 24, 2021","Director Cate Shortland has said the goal for Black Widow was to make it gritty, grounded, and real. She should have aimed for engaging, entertaining, and comprehensible."

black-widow,Alex Hudson,False,"Jul 23, 2021","As a standalone action caper full of big booms and beautiful brawls, Black Widow has bite."
black-widow,Hosea Rupprecht,False,"Jul 22, 2021","Although Black Widow's story is not as gripping as it could have been, it deserves a place in the pantheon of female superhero movies, much like it's DC counterpart, Wonder Woman."
black-widow,Asia Frey,False,"Jul 21, 2021",Full of satisfying Avengers elements but also functions as its own compelling spy movie.

black-widow,Peter Canavese,False,"Jul 18, 2021","Great casting, a sluggish plot for a Marvel movie--a super hero riff on 'Red Sparrow.'"
black-widow,Jane Freebury,False,"Jul 18, 2021","A trio of strong female characters, a hint of real human drama and some action with true grit don't do this superhero spectacle any harm at all"
black-widow,Valerie Complex,True,"Jul 17, 2021","Director Cate Shortland has a sharp eye for directing action sequences, but the script is flawed."
black-widow,Amanda the Jedi,False,"Jul 17, 2021","Feels like part two for the movie we should have gotten years ago, but still a fun watch with great chemistry between Johansson and Pugh. Yelena is a prized addition to the MCU"

black-widow,Wendy Lee Szany,False,"Jul 17, 2021",Action packed! Great to see an espionage film in the MCU style. Florence Pugh shines in this film. Definitely deserves to be seen on the big screen.
black-widow,Laura Bradley,True,"Jul 16, 2021",It's a fun espionage thriller and Florence Pugh is a marvel. But didn't it also feel extremely phoned in?
black-widow,Daniel Chin,False,"Jul 16, 2021","Natasha Romanoff finally got her own movie, but while it served as a proper send-off for the first female Avenger, it also had one eye on what's next."

black-widow,Nick Johnston,True,"Jul 16, 2021","There's little wit in the writing or cleverness in the storytelling, which features a dull conflict as well as a vacuous, ill-considered villain."
black-widow,Joshua Axelrod,False,"Jul 16, 2021","While it may not be the crème de la crème of the MCU, Black Widow is more than worthy of being Marvel's first feature film to hit theaters during a time when people can actually watch it in that form."

black-widow,Bill Watters,False,"Jul 16, 2021","""Black Widow,"" dials it back from the galactic scale of mad titans and space gods fighting it out to a more manageable superhuman scale of Super-soldiers, assassins, and secret agents. It easily stands alongside the MCU's other solo outings."
black-widow,Nicolás Delgadillo,False,"Jul 16, 2021","The film may not be one of Marvel's very best, but it shows that the studio still has the ability to wow audiences on the big screen."
black-widow,Aviva Dove-Viebahn,False,"Jul 15, 2021","Black Widow may be an enjoyable romp on the surface, but as a triumphant send-off for Natasha Romanoff, it feels hollow: too little, too late."
black-widow,Rich Cline,False,"Jul 15, 2021","Thankfully, director Cate Shortland infuses rich dynamics in the relationships and a more character-based approach to the action."
black-widow,Mattie Lucas,True,"Jul 15, 2021","It should come as no surprise that a film churned out by the biggest entertainment conglomerate on earth, is in fact a de facto apologia for American exceptionalism."
black-widow,Germain Lussier,False,"Jul 15, 2021","The film's direction and performances give it a solid foundation and entertainment value that make it a flawed, by worthy, entry into not just the MCU, but the cinematic universe at large."""
black-widow,Shauna Fox,False,"Jul 15, 2021","While Black Widow was an entertaining and enjoyable spy thriller, it felt less about Natasha and her story, and more about her sister, Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh)."
black-widow,Matthew Passantino,False,"Jul 15, 2021","Shortland isn't afraid to set the camera in the middle of a fight and make the audience feel the punches being thrown, rather than keeping them as spectators on the sidelines."
black-widow,Kevin A. Ranson,False,"Jul 15, 2021",... feels too much like a back door pilot... (otherwise) a solid thriller in the James Bond vein featuring good actors doing a great job with the material given... making it look as good as modern technology can safely allow.
black-widow,Lina Lecaro,False,"Jul 14, 2021","You don't have to be a Marvel uber-nerd to enjoy the latest ""origin story"" based movie starring Scarlett Johansson. In fact, it's so well done, you kinda don't even need to know anything about Marvel to be entertained on a face-value level."
black-widow,Richard Trenholm,False,"Jul 14, 2021","Smart, sexy and perfectly cast, Black Widow barely has a story to speak of but still manages to be a huge amount of fun."
black-widow,Leigh Paatsch,False,"Jul 14, 2021","There is a welcome new emphasis on nuanced character development and a narkier, darker sense of humour that makes Black Widow a very welcome addition to the Marvel fold."
black-widow,Yasser Medina,True,"Jul 14, 2021",It is one of the worst MCU films I have ever seen. [Full review in Spanish]
black-widow,Ian Simmons,False,"Jul 14, 2021","Black Widow absolutely adheres to the spirit of Stan Lee's original vision for Marvel Comics, wherein relatable characters use incredible abilities to grapple with the human condition and issues of the day."
black-widow,Ed Whitfield,True,"Jul 13, 2021",It's as if someone ripped out the movie's uterus.
black-widow,Mark Jackson,False,"Jul 13, 2021","Martial arts-heavy ""Widow"" leans more towards ""Jason Bourne"" than Ironman palm-zapping, so you get a real-feeling fantasy flick instead of (as in the case of ""F9"") a fake-feeling ""real"" flick, which makes for a much more satisfying summer actioner."
black-widow,Gabrielle Marceau,True,"Jul 13, 2021","There is surprisingly little girl-power rhetoric here, as if the film itself was weary of years of female superheroes discourse."
black-widow,Peter Howell,False,"Jul 13, 2021",All the action set pieces and explosions happen on cue and [Shortland] handles character development better than most MCU directors.
black-widow,Tim Brennan,False,"Jul 13, 2021","While Black Widow doesn't represent the pinnacle of the MCU, it's still a worthy installment."
black-widow,Linda Cook,False,"Jul 13, 2021","'Black Widow' spins a tale of action, espionage ... and family."

black-widow,Sebastian Zavala Kahn,False,"Jul 12, 2021","There's no denying that ""Black Widow"" would have fared better if it was released 4 years ago. But it should still be able to satisfy most Marvel fans. [Full review in Spanish]"
black-widow,Edwin Arnaudin,False,"Jul 12, 2021",One of the best standalone MCU films.
black-widow,Hannah Rachel Abraham,False,"Jul 12, 2021",Black Widow is a well intentioned standalone film that does more to highlight Florence Pugh's star quality than serve as a fitting farewell to Marvel's first female Avenger.
black-widow,Candice McMillan,False,"Jul 12, 2021","There are still plenty of knives, guns, high-kicks and jumping-off-tall-buildings, but what Black Widow aims to do and, ultimately succeeds at doing, is showing fans the soft, sweet, misunderstood side to the hardened former-Soviet spy."
black-widow,Anahit Behrooz,False,"Jul 12, 2021","Natasha has long been one of the Avengers' most interesting members -- a human amongst superheroes, a woman amongst a horde of ego-driven men -- and this film gives her, if not her due, then space to breathe."
black-widow,Chris McCoy,False,"Jul 12, 2021","With director Cate Shortland at the helm, Black Widow is the best superhero picture since Black Panther. It's not just an acceptably entertaining Marvel product, but an actual good film in its own right"
black-widow,Allen Adams,False,"Jul 12, 2021","Black Widow isn't the best MCU movie. It's not really in the top tier, really. And it doesn't offer as many broader connections as we might like. But as far as popcorn-munching action-packed cinematic adventures go, you could do a lot worse."
black-widow,Melanie McFarland,False,"Jul 12, 2021","In all the ways that matter to an MCU fan, Black Widow the film meets or exceeds all expectations. It is a killer action flick, and a unique viewing experience... in that I loved it, and the fact that I loved it also makes me livid."
black-widow,Emmanuel Báez,False,"Jul 12, 2021",Director Cate Shortland and screenwriter Eric Pearson elevate the character... although they can't avoid the typical hackneyed marvel action it takes to make her feel like part of a great superhero story. [Full review in Spanish]
black-widow,Ani Bundel,False,"Jul 12, 2021","There simply isn't enough that can be said about Pugh, who is the movie's secret weapon. An absolute delight from beginning to end, she delivers all the best one-liners."

black-widow,Amanda Sink,False,"Jul 12, 2021","Black Widow's triumphant return to the big screen parallels the dark storyline with the real-life horrors of human trafficking, domestic violence, and historical female oppression."
black-widow,David Hogan,False,"Jul 12, 2021","The main thing to take away from the film is ""fun action sequences"", if you're looking for something deeper or more impactful on the MCU timeline then you won't find it here..."
black-widow,Travis Johnson,False,"Jul 12, 2021","A much more grounded, street-level kind of affair than the high-flying, universe-shaking antics we've grown accustomed to, and Shortland's character-first approach is a good fit for the material."
black-widow,Lee McCoy,True,"Jul 12, 2021","Finally Natasha R. can have her own movie. But it's a few years too late and chock full of superficial characters, eye rolling suspension of disbelief (rest easy F9), and forced humor."
black-widow,Felix Vasquez Jr.,False,"Jul 12, 2021","Delivers on every front as a comic book movie, MCU entry, and Summer blockbuster."
black-widow,Sheraz Farooqi,True,"Jul 11, 2021","While Black Widow featured a brilliant opening credits and strong character moments, the film ultimately felt uneven and a bit late to Phase 4. Florence Pugh was an absolute standout."
black-widow,Paul Salfen,False,"Jul 11, 2021","Although darker in tone than most other Marvel movies, the action begins right away and it hardly lets up throughout the film and despite some grim themes, there's also a lot of laughs - a very fun superspy romp."
black-widow,Michael Ward,False,"Jul 11, 2021","The character-focused direction and storytelling grounded in...reality sets this apart from the super-serious, fantastical stories told by Iron Men, Captain Americas, and all the rest."

black-widow,Nathalia Aryani,False,"Jul 11, 2021","Black Widow has Mission Impossible's escapes and Bourne's hand-to-hand combat wrapped in a Bond's sleek style. The character finally has a backstory and a closure, and a potential for her legacy to continue on."
black-widow,Andrea Chase,False,"Jul 11, 2021","Action sequences come thick and fast, with an aerial rescue that is both heart-stopping and that obeys (most) of the laws of physics, but this is a film that focuses on sentiment while somehow eschewing the trappings of sentimentality."
black-widow,Eli Glasner,False,"Jul 10, 2021","If anything Black Widow feels like the movie Marvel should have been made years ago. However what saves the day isn't the action, but Natasha's family."

black-widow,Sonny Bunch,False,"Jul 10, 2021",The familial interactions are the best part of the movie ... and a welcome distraction from the fact that there isn't anything approaching an interesting action sequence.
black-widow,Karen M. Peterson,False,"Jul 10, 2021","Natasha Romanoff's solo feature may be five or ten years overdue, but what director Cate Shortland has given us in Black Widow is better late than never."
black-widow,John Urbancich,True,"Jul 10, 2021","The best scene in the movie, obviously designed to peek into Marvel's cinematic future, comes at the very end of the ever-lengthy, final-credits process. Surely diehard Avengers fanatics likely already know everything about it."
black-widow,Victor Stiff,False,"Jul 10, 2021","Black Widow doesn't beat you over the head with female empowerment themes, but these concepts are just as integral to the story as its blistering action sequences."

black-widow,Casey Chong,False,"Jul 10, 2021","[Cate] Shortland took the cues from the popular spy-movie genre seen in the likes of James Bond, Mission: Impossible and Bourne franchise and filled her film with some of the best action scenes ever seen in MCU."
black-widow,Neil Morris,True,"Jul 10, 2021","Combining ""The Americans"" with ""Salt,"" the otherwise erratic plot boils down to if Paige Jennings grew up to become Evelyn Salt."
black-widow,Stephanie Zacharek,False,"Jul 10, 2021","Pursuit of the nameless something just out of reach is the motor that keeps Black Widow whirring. If nothing else, it puts the self-serious quest for a dumb jeweled glove in perspective."
black-widow,Kevin Carr,False,"Jul 10, 2021","This has everything you want from a Marvel movie. It's got the action, it's got the scope, it's got the humor, it's got the irreverence, it has a good villain."
black-widow,Maya Phillips,True,"Jul 10, 2021","""Black Widow"" never feels more than just a footnote in the story, a detour that holds no weight in the larger M.C.U. narrative, except to set up Yelena for a larger role in the future."
black-widow,Brandon Avery,False,"Jul 10, 2021","Easily one of the better solo MCU Films! Fantastic Action, Heart, Emotion, and Story-arc! Can watch over and over again!"
black-widow,David Poland,False,"Jul 10, 2021","If you don't want to have a good time at the movies, don't see Black Widow."
black-widow,Mark Kermode,False,"Jul 9, 2021","The film put flesh on the bones of the character in a way that hadn't been done before. I enjoyed it and I wasn't bored, though I was baffled by the accents."
black-widow,Shawn Edwards,True,"Jul 9, 2021","Loud, clumsy and cinematically desolate."
black-widow,K. Austin Collins,True,"Jul 9, 2021","It's a strange movie: front-loaded with its best action, its zippiest writing, its canniest pleasures, then derailed by exposition that only serves to let the air out of the room for being so obvious rather than deepening what's there."
black-widow,Paul McGuire Grimes,False,"Jul 9, 2021","As Yelena, Florence Pugh will be your next fan-favorite Marvel character."
black-widow,Shirley Li,True,"Jul 9, 2021","The film ceases to be about Natasha wrestling with her heroism; by pitting her against a raging misogynist, Black Widow tries to simplistically cast Natasha as a pop-feminist icon."
black-widow,Louisa Moore,False,"Jul 9, 2021","A solid film all around, Black Widow should appeal to anyone looking to spend a few hours enjoying some empowering, female-driven action, with a darker emotional slant."
black-widow,Richard Whittaker,False,"Jul 9, 2021",Black Widow gives Marvel's superspy the callback-filled swan song that she and the loyal audience deserve.
black-widow,Esther Zuckerman,True,"Jul 9, 2021","Coming out more than a year after it was supposed to, it feels like an awkward reminder of what Marvel failed to do early on in its run, but occasionally, mostly whenever Pugh is in control, it's a thrilling preview of what's to come."
black-widow,Lapacazo Magrira Sandoval,False,"Jul 9, 2021","A solid nod to the director Cate Shortland (Somersault), who establishes a mood from the first couple of frames."
black-widow,Jorge Ignacio Castillo,False,"Jul 9, 2021","While this sounds like your standard Marvel solo outing (the hero must reckon with the past to defeat a villain they had a hand in creating), Black Widow benefits from the family dynamics."
black-widow,Abby Olcese,True,"Jul 9, 2021","It suggests a bright future for Pugh's Yelena, but, ironically, does the bare minimum in finally giving Natasha Romanoff her due."
black-widow,Miles Surrey,True,"Jul 9, 2021","...the issues with Black Widow go beyond the past and its ill-timed release. Marvel waited too long to tell Natasha's story, but it's also proved unfit to do so."
black-widow,Doug Walker,False,"Jul 9, 2021","It suffers from a bad case of ""Tell don't show"" and what it shows is often shaky and hard to see. When it ""tells"" though, it is well written and nicely acted. Just enough to say the film is okay."
black-widow,tt stern-enzi,False,"Jul 9, 2021","We waited two years for this. And it's so worth it. Yeah, it's good."
black-widow,Emma Simmonds,False,"Jul 9, 2021",It all adds up to a film that feels like a fittingly emotional final hurrah for a much-loved heroine.
black-widow,Richard Roeper,True,"Jul 9, 2021","Johansson and co-star Florence Pugh are terrific, but the lightweight story relies on implausible plot turns and cheap soap opera antics."
black-widow,Norman Wilner,False,"Jul 9, 2021","Finally the hero of her own story, Scarlett Johansson knits together a decade of Natasha Romanoff's inconsistent characterization in a satisfying action thriller."
black-widow,Ryan Syrek,False,"Jul 9, 2021","If you want people to think you're good at something, don't have Florence Pugh do the same thing right next to you."
black-widow,Brian Lowry,False,"Jul 9, 2021","The approach largely works, in more small-boned fashion, thanks in part to the crispness of the action, whose fight sequences have as much in common with the kinetic aspect of the Bourne saga as superhero-style pyrotechnics."
black-widow,Chris Knight,True,"Jul 9, 2021","I wish the story felt like it had more traction, more sense of purpose, rather than being a side-story shoehorned in between more powerful tales."
black-widow,Kyle Wilson,False,"Jul 9, 2021","Natasha Romanoff is given the backstory and send-off she deserves, while introducing fans to terrific new characters that can now play in the sandbox of the MCU."
black-widow,Jonathan W. Hickman,False,"Jul 9, 2021","After the head-trip that marked the early episodes of ""WandaVision"" and the longing, somewhat clumsy angst that permeated ""The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,"" it is refreshing to experience an entire character arc in just over two hours."
black-widow,Matthew Turner,False,"Jul 9, 2021","Impressively acted and directed, Black Widow delivers action, humour and emotion in the mighty Marvel manner."
black-widow,Lauren Coates,False,"Jul 9, 2021","Though the writing leaves something to be desired, between Pugh's charisma, the sense of closure it gives the character, and the compelling (if not properly explored) story at its core makes it a fitting farewell for a beloved hero."
black-widow,M.V. Moorhead,False,"Jul 9, 2021","Directed by Cate Shortland from a script by Eric Pearson, Black Widow is everything that Marvel movies usually are: well-made, absorbing, overlong, uneven."
black-widow,Scott Campbell,False,"Jul 9, 2021","Black Widow isn't going to go down in the history books as top-tier Marvel Cinematic Universe content, but it's not too bad at all."
black-widow,Rick Bentley,True,"Jul 9, 2021",A bigger reason for the film coming up so short in quality is that the title character ends up being the least interesting of all the players.
black-widow,Alex Abad-Santos,False,"Jul 9, 2021",Though her selflessness goes against what life has continually taught her - that relationships are a weakness that will always let you down - it's also the skeleton key to her legacy. What a thrill to finally be able to understand it.
black-widow,Alicia Gilstorf,False,"Jul 9, 2021",Black Widow is sharp-witted female butt-kicking excellence in its strongest form and the superhero blockbuster at its most restrained.
black-widow,Janice Rodrigues,False,"Jul 9, 2021","While Black Widow makes for a great stand-alone spy thriller that packs in plenty of entertainment value, fans who have been waiting for a film that explores the character in great depth will simply have to keep waiting."
black-widow,Brent Hankins,False,"Jul 9, 2021","Director Cate Shortland adopts a strategy not unlike that of Captain America: The Winter Soldier... mostly eschewing the massive stakes of other Marvel Cinematic Universe entries, at least until the gratuitous goofiness of the third act."
black-widow,James Verniere,False,"Jul 9, 2021","A great feminist James Bond film. Johansson, Pugh, Weisz, Harbour and Winstone are great. Aussie director Cate Shortland is a find."
black-widow,Beth Accomando,False,"Jul 9, 2021","Black Widow serves up an uneven but fun ride with the action keeping the pace mostly breathless. Florence Pugh, however, steals the show."
black-widow,Drew Dietsch,True,"Jul 9, 2021","[Black Widow is] not the worst Marvel Cinematic Universe movie, but it is easily one of the blandest."
black-widow,Stephen Garrett,False,"Jul 9, 2021","Black Widow feels like a different sort of Marvel movie. But still, with explosions."
black-widow,George M. Thomas,False,"Jul 9, 2021",There's little denying where the film excels -- in concept and message -- as we're given a fully realized backstory for Natasha Romanoff that's smart and compelling
black-widow,Luke Goodsell,False,"Jul 9, 2021","Packed with lively set pieces, amusing performances and the occasional heavier theme, it's an action thriller that also manages to be an ode to sisterhood and the chaos of atypical families."
black-widow,Damond Fudge,False,"Jul 9, 2021","In time, I hope we get more stand-alone entries in the MCU focused on its other great female characters, and maybe without so much support from others. Until then, Black Widow will do nicely in filling that void."
black-widow,Lauren Bradshaw,False,"Jul 9, 2021","Although this may be the swan song for Natasha Romonoff, if Black Widow is any indication of what Marvel has up its sleeve for Phase 4 of the cinematic universe, we are in for a real treat."
black-widow,MaryAnn Johanson,True,"Jul 9, 2021","Dishearteningly less concerned with giving Natasha Romanoff her own story than with setting up her MCU replacement. Superfluous, backward-looking, its bit of feminism belabored. She deserved better."
black-widow,Dan Tabor,False,"Jul 9, 2021","Black Widow was worth the wait and actually does this character and her shadowy world justice, while taking care to finally give her the narrative arc she desperately deserved."
black-widow,Peter Travers,False,"Jul 9, 2021","Even when bloated Marvel action robs the film of intimacy, Johansson digs deep into how her Russian assassin once felt outside the Avengers bubble. And Pugh deserves Oscar love as her pretend sister in this surprising salute to female empowerment."
black-widow,Kurt Loder,False,"Jul 9, 2021","Pugh is on hand to take up the Avengers torch from Johansson and inaugurate a new phase of the franchise. With her anti-glam looks and no-nonsense presence, she's an excellent choice for this assignment."
black-widow,Kevin Brackett,False,"Jul 9, 2021","Exciting and well-crafted action, a nice tribute to the character audiences have loved over the past decade."
black-widow,Wendy Shreve,False,"Jul 9, 2021","Black Widow ensnares, bites, but doesn't devour its audience."
black-widow,Alan Zilberman,True,"Jul 9, 2021",Black Widow wants to give MCU fans the reward of understanding a reference without asking them to do the work. This is diluted fandom.
black-widow,Jeff Mitchell,False,"Jul 9, 2021","We get the lowdown on Budapest, albeit without a hearty bowl of goulash. Anyway, this cloak-and-dagger story somewhat satisfies."
black-widow,Sarah Ward,False,"Jul 9, 2021",Gives its namesake a thrilling big-screen outing - in no small part because it needn't waste time setting up an obvious sequel.
black-widow,Simon Miraudo,False,"Jul 9, 2021","This plot is preserved in amber, so you know it's not going to affect the grand scheme of things. [But] there's enough here to justify it as a movie over a TV series."
black-widow,Matthew Dougherty,False,"Jul 9, 2021",Black Widow earns its title by deepening and celebrating the titular heroine with a story that feels genuinely personal.
black-widow,Michael Calleri,True,"Jul 9, 2021","As talented as Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh are, nothing they do or say feels honest or character-driven."
black-widow,Ruth Maramis,False,"Jul 9, 2021","If this were truly Scarlett Johansson's last outing as Black Widow, she'd have ended on a high note. A fun mix of spy thriller + superhero genre that's essentially about family, featuring a scene stealing performance from Florence Pugh."
black-widow,Dustin Chase,True,"Jul 9, 2021","It's Scarlett Johansson's movie, but Florence Pugh steals the show. Adequate but the film never takes cinematic risks."
black-widow,Ty Burr,True,"Jul 9, 2021","The property that was supposed to be the first movie installment of ""Phase Four"" by now just feels phased out."
black-widow,Kevin Maher,False,"Jul 9, 2021","And yes, the climax, like all Marvel movie climaxes, is splattered with far too much physics-defying CGI work, but for once, and thanks to the meticulous character work from all concerned, you will really care."
black-widow,Eric Webb,False,"Jul 9, 2021","Like most of her peers' first solo outings, this is a good-not-great genre stand: Think of the wartime adventure of ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" and the interdimensional space myth of ""Thor."""
black-widow,Randy Myers,False,"Jul 9, 2021","It's worth seeing on a big screen, not just once but twice."
black-widow,Courtney Small,True,"Jul 8, 2021","Black Widow, much like the family at its core, is a messy affair. Although the action sequences are entertaining, the awkward dramatic beats hinder the overall flow of the film."
black-widow,Kristian M. Lin,False,"Jul 8, 2021","The movie is the best blockbuster so far this summer, and it's a proudly female one. That's not nothing."
black-widow,Tom Meek,False,"Jul 8, 2021","Harbour, so good in the recent Steven Soderbergh noir No Sudden Move, brings the comic relief in spades."
black-widow,Bennett Campbell Ferguson,True,"Jul 8, 2021",Black Widow isn't much of an action movie -- it exists mostly to fill the narrative gap between Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War.
black-widow,Dominic Corry,False,"Jul 8, 2021","It's all very big and impressive, but considering that Marvel delivers so consistently, action-wise, I found myself much more appreciative of Aussie director Cate Shortland's emphasis on character, which helps this resonate."
black-widow,Patrick McDonald,False,"Jul 8, 2021","A roller coaster ride of surprising reveals, feminist philosophy and the wam-bam-pow action that has become beloved in our current entertainment universe. Black Magic Widow!"
black-widow,Joe Morgenstern,False,"Jul 8, 2021","These are superb and perfectly complementary performances in a story that is, in its essence, about sisterly love."
black-widow,Jeva Lange,False,"Jul 8, 2021","Without needing to be the ""first"" of anything this time around, Black Widow became something else: the first superhero movie I've loved in years -- no ""female"" qualifier needed."
black-widow,Leslie Combemale,False,"Jul 8, 2021","Johansson, Pugh, and Weisz create the perfect trio of complicated heroines and David Harbour offers great comic relief. Can we put the ""women can't direct action"" thing to rest?"
black-widow,Dana Barbuto,False,"Jul 8, 2021","Johansson does wonders revealing her hardened character's human side, peeling away at Romanoff's backstory and motivations."
black-widow,Alan Cerny,False,"Jul 8, 2021","Before now, the story of Black Widow may not have been essential to the larger story, but after Black Widow, I cannot imagine the Infinity Saga without it."
black-widow,Jeffrey M. Anderson,False,"Jul 8, 2021","The fight scenes do eventually take a backseat to the unlikely family drama that slowly unfolds among the four stubborn, vicious, and sometimes hilarious family members."
black-widow,Sarah Marrs,False,"Jul 8, 2021","A throwback to the beginnings of the MCU when Marvel movies were a little simpler, a little more stripped down, and focused a wee bit more on character interactions than shoving 900 units of plot in our faces."
black-widow,Mark Dujsik,True,"Jul 8, 2021","[I]t's ultimately disappointing how much of Black Widow is, in its comparatively limited way, just more of the same."
black-widow,Frank Swietek,True,"Jul 8, 2021","A sidebar to the overall Marvel project rather than an essential part of it, a mixture of spy story and superhero movie that, despite the charisma and chemistry of both Johansson and Pugh, comes across as less than the sum of its parts."
black-widow,Steve Katz,True,"Jul 8, 2021","Like pretty much every Marvel film, Black Widow is a polished and easy-to-watch blockbuster, but that's all it is, and it's tough to remember anything even remotely notable after the credits roll."
black-widow,Michael J. Casey,False,"Jul 8, 2021","Half good, half fine."
black-widow,Vincent Mancini,False,"Jul 8, 2021",Surprisingly fun until it remembers that it's supposed to be a Marvel tie-in.
black-widow,Lisa Johnson Mandell,False,"Jul 8, 2021","The genius of Black Widow is that while it satisfies Marvel aficionados, it also accommodates, and even thrills, those who are not experts on the franchise."
black-widow,Jim Judy,False,"Jul 8, 2021","""Black Widow"" -- like its namesake arachnid -- packs a potent punch that you might not see coming. And that's a good thing in this case."
black-widow,Daniel Barnes,True,"Jul 8, 2021","Take out all the mindless bickering, pointless fight scenes, cutesy-poo Avengers references and tie-ins to future Disney+ TV series, and you're left with maybe 75 to 80 minutes of actual movie."
black-widow,Ryan Silberstein,False,"Jul 8, 2021","Black Widow is not a ""girl power"" story, but about fighting for those unable to fight for themselves or see their own value in the world."
black-widow,Travis Hopson,False,"Jul 8, 2021","Black Widow is an unstable mix of twisted family drama and big superhero action, with the latter closer in tone to The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, or even Mission: Impossible."
black-widow,Christopher Lloyd,False,"Jul 8, 2021","Though the blammo action stuff is a little stale, Scarlett Johansson finally gets a chance to shoulder her way past the ""big Avenger"" boys and show subtler shadings for her superspy."
black-widow,Richard Crouse,False,"Jul 8, 2021","Despite the wild CGI action and Jason Bourne style one-on-one combat, Black Widow feels more grounded than most other Marvel movies."
black-widow,Thomas Caldwell,False,"Jul 8, 2021","For the most part Black Widow is a satisfying blend of comedy, drama and of course action."
black-widow,Anthony Morris,False,"Jul 8, 2021","As a farewell to Natasha, Black Widow is a workmanlike effort; as an introduction to the new Black Widow, it's a thrilling success."
black-widow,Charles Koplinski,True,"Jul 8, 2021","The highlight is Pugh who steals the film from Johansson, supplying a sense of barbed humor as well as humanity to her character that's welcomed. A star is born amidst all this chaos."

black-widow,Emmanuel Noisette,False,"Jul 7, 2021",Black Widow is a dramatic spy thriller that does its character justice. The downside is that this justice was far too late.
black-widow,Rendy Jones,False,"Jul 7, 2021","Black Widow may not be the grand send-off to Natasha Romanoff, for it borrows far too many elements from that other MCU spy flick, but it's still a fun summer blockbuster."
black-widow,Dan Scully,True,"Jul 7, 2021","The pieces are great, but the execution leaves plenty to be desired."
black-widow,Jake Wilson,True,"Jul 7, 2021","The film isn't likely to go down in Marvel history as much more than a footnote, nor does it tell us much about the studio's envisaged next phase."
black-widow,Ryan Gilbey,True,"Jul 7, 2021","It's no small thing to bring together actors who have carried two of the most audacious films of the past decade (Johansson in Under the Skin, Pugh in Midsommar) but they deserve better than this material."
black-widow,Micheal Compton,False,"Jul 7, 2021",It's so easygoing and effortless that it's easy to forget how hard it really is to craft something this entertaining.
black-widow,Kyle Smith,True,"Jul 7, 2021","Just as the comedy scenes aren't funny, the action scenes aren't thrilling. Natasha never seems as if she's in any danger. She never seems like she's having fun, either."
black-widow,Peter Sobczynski,False,"Jul 7, 2021","If this does turn out to be Johansson's farewell to the role that helped make her one of the most popular actresses in the world, it is a film that does ultimately honor both her and the character."
black-widow,Shah Shahid,False,"Jul 7, 2021","Black Widow is still a taut and entertaining action thriller. And the compelling nature of the mystery around the character herself, keeps you engaged throughout"

black-widow,Wenlei Ma,False,"Jul 7, 2021","Before it hits those final act problems, Black Widow is an impressive balance between family drama and spy thriller - and one of the emotionally stronger entries in the Marvel pantheon."
black-widow,Jim Schembri,False,"Jul 7, 2021",Is it really conceivable that nobody at Marvel has dared knock out a memo raising the issue of how almost all of their big action sequences look so much alike? Even the fight scenes here look as though they've been copied from previous Marvel films.
black-widow,Mike McGranaghan,False,"Jul 7, 2021",Black Widow offers a far deeper portrait of family than the Fast and Furious saga does with all its empty platitudes.
black-widow,Jeanne Kaplan,False,"Jul 7, 2021","It's fun, highly amusing -- I'm talking laugh out loud -- and wildly entertaining."

black-widow,Julian Roman,False,"Jul 6, 2021",Black Widow can best be described as The Americans meets 007 in a highly entertaining adventure. Florence Pugh steals the show with her magnetic screen presence.
black-widow,Katie Walsh,False,"Jul 6, 2021","""Black Widow"" has the look and feel of a globe-trotting spy thriller, and it isn't afraid to puncture some of the ""Avengers"" mythology, including grappling with what it means to be a ""hero."""

black-widow,Susan Kamyab,False,"Jul 6, 2021","Though ""Black Widow"" may not be as action packed as the usual MCU movies, the fight scenes we're given are clean, quick, and well-choreographed. The editing by Leigh Folsom Boyd is flawless and makes the over 2 hour runtime fly by."
black-widow,Karen Gordon,False,"Jul 6, 2021","Marvel's latest origin story owes as much to Bourne and Bond as it does to the MCU, and ultimately reveals Natasha Romanov's soulful humanity."
black-widow,Laura Potier,False,"Jul 6, 2021","There's a lot to enjoy about Marvel's latest... And yet, while Black Widow is a valiant attempt to do right by the ex-spy and Avenger, it's ultimately too little, too late."
black-widow,Mark Meszoros,False,"Jul 6, 2021","An origin story for the character - aka Natasha Romanoff, a spy-turned-Avenger - it is slightly above average for a Marvel movie. That also makes it above average in terms of Hollywood blockbusters."
black-widow,Cary Darling,False,"Jul 6, 2021",Shortland has made a credible action film that also functions as a twisted family portrait as well as a story of a woman coming to terms with her past.

black-widow,Jeff York,True,"Jul 4, 2021","The film's truer purpose seems to serve as a set-up for the next Black Widow character - Pugh's Yelena Bolava - who'll be taking over the franchise, but that could've been done in many ways other than this approach."

black-widow,Kevin L. Lee,False,"Jul 3, 2021",Fans of Natasha getting her own movie will be satisfied with Black Widow. The film does more than enough on exploring the character and domestic drama while serving up the typical car chases and explosive third acts that we've come to expect from Marvel.

black-widow,Robert Denerstein,False,"Jul 3, 2021","Black Widow isn't exactly the kind of movie that redefines a genre or challenges you with unexpected depth...but the movie uses its Avengers heritage to good effect and, damn, if it doesn't include some agreeable humor..."
black-widow,Meagan Damore,False,"Jul 3, 2021","Black Widow finds clever ways to play with Natasha's long MCU history, while also reckoning with the past we've only heard about. Anyone who has followed the character's film journey closely will be rewarded."

black-widow,Mick LaSalle,True,"Jul 2, 2021","It's the cynicism that's depressing. After all, ""Black Widow"" is not an attempt at a good movie that failed. That would've been respectable. Rather, it's an attempt to make a piece of garbage commerce that succeeded completely."
black-widow,Matt Singer,False,"Jul 2, 2021",Functions less as a showcase for the title character and more as a sneaky introduction for Pugh.
black-widow,Don Shanahan,False,"Jul 2, 2021","""Black Widow"" aims to put a superhero stamp on the female spy thriller niche and cannot help but look like a pretender."

black-widow,Carla Renata,False,"Jul 1, 2021","High on action, great insight into Natasha's family backstory and great message on female empowerment. Florence Pugh steals the show while bieng the perfect compliment to Scarlett Johansson's Natasha. Loved it!!!!"
black-widow,Chris Stuckmann,True,"Jul 1, 2021","This film could have been great. It could have been so much better than it is, but they just kind of made a contractual movie that feels like a placeholder for other things in the future."
black-widow,Linda and Al Lerner,False,"Jul 1, 2021",It begins as an intriguing prequel of of Natasha Romanoff's (Scarlett Johansson) backstory as the Russian spy who became one of the Avengers. But this film turns messy in the last act.
black-widow,Jonathan Roberts,False,"Jul 1, 2021","If Black Widow is truly the final goodbye for Johansson as Natasha (well, you never know), this is a decent exit."
black-widow,Jennifer Merin,False,"Jul 1, 2021","Cate Shortland's directorial perspective and prowess are evident in every frame of Black Widow... a beautifully crafted and technically impressive flick, she's planted seeds for serious thought and discourse that make Black Widow meaningful and memorable."

black-widow,Elias Savada,False,"Jul 1, 2021","There may not be much in the way of superpowers in Black Widow, but there's plenty of whoop-ass, mano-a-mano (actually, there's more womano-a-womano) combat to keep you entertained over the film's 2 1/4-hour length."

black-widow,Jake Coyle,False,"Jun 30, 2021","It's absorbing in its own right. Less occupied with driving a universe of movies forward, the almost-standalone film instead digs into slightly darker, deeper realms of the typically bright and shiny Marvel world."
black-widow,Clint Worthington,False,"Jun 30, 2021","It's absolutely mid-tier Marvel, alternatively harmed and aided by its late position in the slate. But as a reintroduction to the cinematic universe after a year off due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it's definitely worth a look."

black-widow,Catalina Combs,False,"Jun 30, 2021","Black Widow brings Natasha's life full circle, filling in the gaps, and giving us more of a look at the real Natasha. Given the storyline and themes, what I like most about Black Widow is that it doesn't take itself too seriously."

black-widow,Andrew Webster,False,"Jun 29, 2021","As an action movie it's solid, with lots of fun set pieces to gawk at and a particularly menacing villain in Taskmaster... It also works surprisingly well as a standalone story."

black-widow,Philip De Semlyen,False,"Jun 29, 2021",A satisfying mix of muscle and emotion.
black-widow,Tim Grierson,True,"Jun 29, 2021","""Black Widow"" seems like a missed opportunity - an energetic placeholder in the Marvel Cinematic Universe meant to tide audiences over until a bigger, richer adventure comes along."
black-widow,Tania Lamb,False,"Jun 29, 2021","If you can get over its imperfections (an abrupt ending, a weak villain), Black Widow is a fantastic ride - about 5 years too late."
black-widow,Tim Stevens,False,"Jun 29, 2021","By this point, Johansson feels so comfortable in Romanoff's skin that it lends the film a strangely naturalistic feel. Pugh, on the other hand, seems to be pushing plenty of effort into her work, which adds a nice layer of meta to their scenes together."
black-widow,John Nguyen,True,"Jun 29, 2021","[Black Widow's] story never reaches its full potential, especially with the lackluster villains."
black-widow,Grace Randolph,False,"Jun 29, 2021","Third act is horrible, & Scarlett Johansson deserves better after waiting so long for a solo movie. But Florence Pugh is amazing & the first 2/3rds are interesting enough."
black-widow,Mikel Zorrilla,False,"Jun 29, 2021","A movie about Black Widow may not make as much sense now as it did a few years ago, but it handles its ingredients well and features a shining performance from Florence Pugh. [Full Review in Spanish]"
black-widow,Charlotte O'Sullivan,False,"Jun 29, 2021","There's an art to delaying the inevitable. By the god of thunder, director Cate Shortland demonstrates that art in this Marvel spin-off, which basically functions as a wondrous, two-hour-long goodbye."
black-widow,Caryn James,False,"Jun 29, 2021","Maybe it's no surprise that the film is entertaining and full of action. It is unexpected, though, that Black Widow may be the least Avenger-like movie in the series so far."
black-widow,Bill Goodykoontz,False,"Jun 29, 2021","Johansson once again embodies a character driven by her pain; now we know where it comes from. Pugh is outstanding, tapping into some of that same pain but making it her own."
black-widow,Johnny Oleksinski,False,"Jun 29, 2021","The movie's vibe isn't like your average MCU entry at all, really. What it reminded me of are the many James Bond films where 007 goes rogue and cavorts around world cities seeking his revenge du jour."

black-widow,Jared Mobarak,False,"Jun 29, 2021",Expository bottle episodes are as crucial to comics as crossovers. Not every detour is a waste of time.

black-widow,Eric Kohn,False,"Jun 29, 2021","At its best... ""Black Widow"" is a welcome break from the overwrought transmedia machine that dictates Disney's biggest franchise bets, and almost invites you to forget what's at stake."

black-widow,A.A. Dowd,False,"Jun 29, 2021","Casting is maybe the primary strength of this mega-franchise, and the film's familiar bantering dynamic gets a strong assist from new hires."
black-widow,EJ Moreno,True,"Jun 29, 2021","Marvel returns to cinemas, and its first film back is a bit lackluster. This feels ten years too late, not just for the character but for this type of bland action film."

black-widow,Jamie Jirak,False,"Jun 29, 2021","While it's hard not to dwell on the fact that Black Widow should have been made a decade ago, the new movie still manages to be a well-placed addition to the franchise and the perfect send-off for Scarlett Johansson and Natasha Romanoff."
black-widow,Lupe Rodriguez Haas,False,"Jun 29, 2021","Florence Pugh and Scarlet Johansson's relationship is the heart of the story. David Harbour is thoroughly enjoyable. While not a perfect film, it's a bittersweet feeling watching Scarlett's run as Natasha Romanoff coming to a final end in the MCU."
black-widow,Owen Gleiberman,False,"Jun 29, 2021","Shortland works in unvarnished closeup and establishes a mood of lurching, desultory anxiety that's closer to Russian neorealism than the Russo brothers."
black-widow,Tessa Smith,False,"Jun 29, 2021",This action-packed film coupled with some serious emotional family plot points will give Natasha fans what they have been waiting for -- but Florence Pugh steals the show.
black-widow,Peter Bradshaw,False,"Jun 29, 2021","For fans of Black Widow and everyone else, this episode is great fun and Harbour could well ascend to spinoff greatness of his own."

black-widow,Hoai-Tran Bui,True,"Jun 29, 2021",Black Widow falls victim to the big bombast characteristic of the studio. The result is a disappointing solo movie that ends up burying Natasha Romanoff once again.
black-widow,Nate Adams,False,"Jun 29, 2021","Some will immediately sniff out ""Black Widow"" for the glorified side mission, meant to set up an inevitable Disney+ series, that it is but ""Black Widow"" manages to get the job done, giving the beloved Natasha Romanoff the spotlight she always deserved."
black-widow,Kate Sánchez,False,"Jun 29, 2021","Black Widow embraces the history of the character-the good and the bad...This core element of the film is what makes it perfect for comic book readers, while the spectacle will satisfy MCU fans who have only ever watched the films."

black-widow,Sean Chandler,False,"Jun 29, 2021","While it's certainly an odd time to choose to tell this story, that doesn't stop it from being another solid entry in the MCU. The story is smaller, darker, and more personal, and features several standout new characters."

black-widow,Sherin Nicole,False,"Jun 29, 2021",This new Marvel movie launches into the espionage and assassin genres with the unblinking verve of a Bourne or a Wick. It's an unexpected form for an Avengers offshoot to take. But that's what makes it work.

captain-america-the-first-avenger,Peter Canavese,False,"Jul 21, 2011",The most noticeable motif Johnston plays with is the use of a garbage-can lid as a shield: more important than $140 million dollars worth of toys is Johnston's childlike sense of play.

captain-america-the-winter-soldier,Norman Wilner,False,"Jan 4, 2015","It has a charismatic hero, inspired action choreography and Robert Redford as a living signifier of the days when Hollywood thrillers tried to make you think about stuff between shootouts. Also, it's really funny."

captain-marvel,Richard Crouse,False,"Mar 4, 2021",The convoluted origin story mixed with the cluttered action sequences suck some of the air out of the theatre but their take on the superhero character as both an outsider and one of us is as refreshing as it is unusual.
captain-marvel,Alex Bentley,False,"Feb 18, 2021","A Marvel staple is to keep the story light and entertaining, and Captain Marvel is on par with Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man in that respect."
captain-marvel,David Walsh,True,"Feb 10, 2021","The production and release of Captain Marvel, the new science fiction superhero adventure from Marvel and Disney, has a number of remarkable features, but none of them involve the film's drama, action or characters."
captain-marvel,Fletcher Powell,False,"Feb 9, 2021","This is Marvel's most narratively ambitious movie ... and it's occasionally a little hard to follow. But I'll take that trade, given that it's showing us something new."
captain-marvel,Jeffrey Zhang,False,"Jan 29, 2021","Captain Marvel is the living embodiment of some of the MCU's worst tendencies, but still ends up being an enjoyable ride and a fine introduction for Carol Danvers."
captain-marvel,Candice McMillan,False,"Jan 29, 2021","While I felt let down by the lack of action, I left the theater with far more to chew on. I felt vindicated too ... She personifies strength and courage, and she's a character our daughters should see represented on the big screen."
captain-marvel,Mark Cassidy,False,"Jan 28, 2021",... at some point you just wish the writers would ease up a bit and stop attempting to wring comedy out of each and every situation.
captain-marvel,Joey Morona,False,"Jan 27, 2021","[Captain Marvel] is a blast-- a rip roarin' thrill ride full of humor, heart and guilty-pleasure '90s nostalgia that flips the expectation of an origin story genre on its head."
captain-marvel,Mike Massie,False,"Dec 7, 2020","Despite the standalone nature of this film, the first 40 minutes or so are fairly rough in design, structuring, and visuals."
captain-marvel,Charles Koplinski,False,"Nov 14, 2020","This film pulls off the impressive feat of making an origin story interesting by upending the usual structure of these tales, throwing us headlong into the action with the title heroine and only then revealing how she became an intergalactic warrior."
captain-marvel,Matthew St. Clair,False,"Oct 1, 2020","Captain Marvel may be a safe superhero origin film that provides expected action and humor... But regardless, it's still a satisfying entry in the MCU carried by an effortless star turn from Brie Larson."
captain-marvel,Richard Propes,False,"Sep 4, 2020",Captain Marvel is a good film that does great things for the Marvel Comics Universe.
captain-marvel,Victor Pineyro,False,"Sep 2, 2020","It's far from being the best MCU film, but it does a decent job on introducing on of the most powerful characters of that universe. [Full review in Spanish]"
captain-marvel,Kelechi Ehenulo,False,"Aug 27, 2020","Despite the notable limitations, Captain Marvel delightfully serves its purpose both as a final cornerstone in this epic-long saga but the inspiration gained from seeing a female superhero on screen."
captain-marvel,Stephen A. Russell,False,"Aug 16, 2020","The stakes are far too small for what should be a momentous Marvel movie, and Larson doesn't get to kick anywhere near enough shape-shifting butt."
captain-marvel,Tom Beasley,False,"Aug 15, 2020","If the emotion falls a little short, though, the movie soars with its comedy and action elements."
captain-marvel,Matt Cipolla,True,"Jul 27, 2020","The movie doesn't go far enough in any direction, grounding itself in a mildly entertaining but surprisingly passé center."
captain-marvel,Jason Fraley,False,"Jul 24, 2020",A film that plays it safe with familiar formula but is so entertainingly empowering that it will inspire girls everywhere.
captain-marvel,Steven Prokopy,False,"Jul 20, 2020","At a positively brisk two hours, the film has an old-school action movie vibe that is a long-overdue introduction to a character who holds great promise in years to come."
captain-marvel,Saibal Chatterjee,False,"Jul 20, 2020",Larson is terrific as Vers/Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel.
captain-marvel,Zehra Phelan,False,"Jul 13, 2020","A no-nonsense, punchy and fierce introduction to Captain Marvel - Who runs the world? GIRLS!"
captain-marvel,Allen Almachar,False,"Jul 8, 2020","There's a lot to like with Captain Marvel, but there's a lot to forget as well."
captain-marvel,Doug Walker,True,"Jul 5, 2020","The direction is boring, the acting is boring, the writing is boring...this is pretty boring."
captain-marvel,Alex Hudson,False,"Jul 2, 2020","In a Marvel Cinematic Universe that has grown increasingly complex and interwoven, Captain Marvel succeeds by sticking to the basics."
captain-marvel,Brent McKnight,False,"Jun 30, 2020","""Captain Marvel"" has things going for it that elevate it a bit above the pack and provide more cultural oomph and import, but despite that, this is also a Marvel movie that feels like another Marvel movie."
captain-marvel,Nikki Francisco,False,"Jun 30, 2020","Captain Marvel is an exploration of complex female strength, and while she is different from Thor or Captain America or Iron Man, she is a superhero all the same."
captain-marvel,Damond Fudge,False,"Jun 28, 2020","Captain Marvel hits all the right buttons for an MCU origin story, while also pushing a few that make it stand out from the others."
captain-marvel,Yasser Medina,True,"Jun 27, 2020",Sometimes it stumbles upon the dullest components of a generic formula that is at the service of nonsense. [Full review in Spanish]
captain-marvel,Dan Tabor,False,"May 29, 2020","Filled with an empowering message and sharp-elbowed clapbacks at the toxic male naysayers of the Marvel fanboy universe, Captain Marvel is just what the MCU and fandom in general needs right now."
captain-marvel,Charlotte Harrison,False,"Jan 29, 2020","Solidly good and very enjoyable. But the film has flickers of greatness, most of which are when the film takes on the form of buddy comedy with Larson paired with Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury. Jackson and Brie have a hilarious rapport."
captain-marvel,Catherine Springer,False,"Jan 19, 2020","Captain Marvel is an enjoyable escapist movie that happens to check all the boxes for a modern progressive audience and delivers humor and action in an easy to watch, slickly-made package that maybe even the fanboys might like."
captain-marvel,Kara Warner,False,"Dec 20, 2019",Marvel's first stand-alone female hero is definitely formidable. And very likely a key component in the next movie.
captain-marvel,Siddhant Adlakha,True,"Dec 15, 2019","After all, Captain Marvel is a Marvel Studios film with significant ties to the U.S. military. While it's nominally critical of war, its hands are filthy with government propaganda."

captain-marvel,Katey Stoetzel,False,"Nov 6, 2019","There's a significant amount of time dedicated to an entire alien race, and for a cinematic universe that first introduced space seven years ago, it's refreshing to learn more about the races of the MCU..."
captain-marvel,Jeff York,False,"Oct 21, 2019",Danvers' fish-out-of-water story that occurs when she lands back on earth is where this movie starts to hit its stride.
captain-marvel,Craig Mathieson,False,"Oct 14, 2019","What makes the film work is that a woman claiming her identity from a life that's told her otherwise is explicitly feminist, and when Captain Marvel asserts herself it's not just with noble intent but also galvanising pleasure."
captain-marvel,Hannah Lodge,True,"Sep 27, 2019",The movie's central premise asks: Who is this person? I'm not sure we get more than a superficial answer.
captain-marvel,Rhys Tarling,False,"Sep 26, 2019","It's a middle-tier Marvel movie. And yet I liked it a lot more than that label implies. Brie Larson, Ben Mendelsohn, and Samuel L. Jackson are so much fun to watch. Carol Danvers is so cool."
captain-marvel,Jason Di Rosso,False,"Sep 25, 2019","Captain Marvel packages this dilemma in a stylish, thoughtful and funny superhero movie that's a twist on the usual origin story formula."
captain-marvel,Tim Cogshell,False,"Sep 20, 2019",I like this character and I like this movie. Bri [Larson] is a square-jawed badass.
captain-marvel,Jaime Davis,False,"Sep 17, 2019",...what it lacks in wonder and awe-inducing moments it makes up for in warmth and heart and a strong sense of who Captain Marvel is and where she's going.
captain-marvel,Josh Wilding,False,"Aug 29, 2019","Brie Larson soars as Captain Marvel in this uneven but enjoyable origin story and while there's definitely room for improvement as the character's adventures continue, it's a good start and well worth checking out."
captain-marvel,Kate Rodger,False,"Aug 23, 2019",I just wanted a more cohesively meaningful experience that's all - without the hollow '90s button pushing and with more cinematic oxygen for Brie Larson to breathe in.
captain-marvel,Noah Berlatsky,True,"Aug 22, 2019","The first half hour of Captain Marvel feels disjointed and poorly developed in part because you're dumped into an alien culture you know nothing about, which you see from the perspective of a woman who has no memories and doesn't know who she is."
captain-marvel,Vincent Schilling,False,"Aug 22, 2019","I wanted to LOVE Captain Marvel. I really did. And there was a lot to enjoy, but after all is said and done, I feel a bit underwhelmed. But I did love the Flerken / aka Goose the cat."
captain-marvel,Dana Sloane,False,"Aug 18, 2019",Captain Marvel centers a white protagonist but offers significantly more fleshed-out roles for Fury and Maria that rise above sidekick status.
captain-marvel,Katie Smith-Wong,False,"Aug 18, 2019","After 11 years, a cynic could argue Marvel Studios is almost over-compensating for a lack of a female heroine. But you can't argue with the results - fun, action-packed and empowering, Captain Marvel is the girl power film the MCU needs."
captain-marvel,Nicolás Delgadillo,False,"Aug 17, 2019","Captain Marvel manages to juggle being several different kinds of films at once, and the balancing act, combined with stellar performances and its unique lead hero, make a film nothing short of a triumph."
captain-marvel,A.S. Hamrah,True,"Aug 15, 2019",It's hard to remember Captain Marvel because it was boring.
captain-marvel,Nathaniel Rogers,True,"Aug 8, 2019",Women and fans of female heroes deserved better than Captain Marvel (a mediocre entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe) but there's no denying that it's rousing to see a woman triumph within the context of this heretofore excessively masculine universe.
captain-marvel,Karl Delossantos,False,"Jul 30, 2019","Captain Marvel is a fun, corny, and empowering origin story that feels like a bridge between the past and the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
captain-marvel,Dominic Griffin,True,"Jul 17, 2019",The latest Marvel release is being positioned less as an actual film and more a wokeness bargaining chip for social media debate.
captain-marvel,Rob Dean,False,"Jul 12, 2019","CAPTAIN MARVEL isn't bad but it isn't great. It has some excellent moments, terrific performances, and solid lines of dialogue...audiences should look forward to more adventures with Captain Marvel - but here's to hoping she soars better in those."
captain-marvel,Rucha Sharma,False,"Jul 10, 2019","Brie Larson as Captain Marvel is amazing from the get-go. She embodies the character in the way she carries herself, the confidence, the poise is infectious."

captain-marvel,Allison Rose,False,"Jul 8, 2019",Larson is a great casting choice to play Danvers/Captain Marvel. She has an air of power with a soft femininity underneath and a sarcastic wit.
captain-marvel,Joshua Rivera,False,"Jun 28, 2019","As an action movie, Captain Marvel is really clever, with more than a few twists that'll surprise both comics fans and newcomers...the biggest problem then, is that Captain Marvel is doing so much, we don't actually get to know her all that well."
captain-marvel,Grant Watson,False,"Jun 23, 2019","It works spectacularly as a feminist text, in which a woman steps out from a patriarchal shadow and challenges a sexist male mentor in the process."

captain-marvel,Kimberly Pierce,False,"Jun 13, 2019","Despite the problems, the fact that audiences are now watching female superheroes kick butt on screen is what makes this story special."
captain-marvel,Jeff Mitchell,False,"Jun 10, 2019","Our comic book heroine has to remember her past, and you won't easily forget this fun, milestone movie."
captain-marvel,Chase Whale,False,"Jun 9, 2019",There could not have been a better choice for Captain Marvel than Brie Larson -- she lights up the screen.
captain-marvel,Brandon Davis,False,"Jun 4, 2019","In welcoming a female hero to the big screen as the centerpiece of her own film, Marvel Studios has an expansive and fun hit on its hands. Captain Marvel offers up a complex, heartfelt tale which will leave audiences feeling inspired and satisfied."
captain-marvel,Gary Dowell,False,"May 31, 2019","Breezy and light on gravitas, Captain Marvel doesn't shake up the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it does find a few new ways to perk up the umpteenth superhero origin story."

captain-marvel,Alonso Díaz de la Vega,False,"May 24, 2019","Captain Marvel doesn't try to say much but merely entertain us, and it reminds us that a woman is as strong as a man, but can definitely be funnier. [Full Review in Spanish]"
captain-marvel,Alejandro Alemán,True,"May 23, 2019","A very expository script, that makes use of flashbacks, with a poor representation of a period, telling a story that is not exactly memorable. [Full Review in Spanish]"
captain-marvel,Mattie Lucas,False,"May 18, 2019",One can't quite help but feel that something this groundbreaking should have felt a bit more fresh and adventurous than it ultimately does.
captain-marvel,Aaron Leggo,False,"May 15, 2019",[Larson's] femininity feels fresh and uncompromising and her presence is intriguingly both grounded and otherworldly.
captain-marvel,Beth McDonough,False,"May 8, 2019","Overall, any minor missteps in Captain America aren't enough to detract from the fact that Carol Danvers is an enthusiastically essential addition to the MCU."
captain-marvel,Deirdre Molumby,False,"May 4, 2019","Captain Marvel gives everything a fan girl or boy could want - spectacle, action, heart, and inspiration."
captain-marvel,Peter Gray,False,"May 1, 2019",The type of super-heroine that cinema currently needs and fragile fanboys don't deserve
captain-marvel,Dustin Chase,True,"Apr 30, 2019","The backstory segments, which eat up the first third, are arduous, challenging your patience and viewer endurance."
captain-marvel,Elias Savada,False,"Apr 24, 2019","Captain Marvel, the latest addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, rallies itself after a sluggish start, and ultimately proves itself an acceptable crowdpleaser."
captain-marvel,Tania Lamb,False,"Apr 23, 2019","Shero. Strong. Courageous. Powerful. You may be able to find flaws and nitpick at what you didn't like, but at the end of the day, Captain Marvel does its job."
captain-marvel,Tessa Smith,False,"Apr 20, 2019",Captain Marvel is the perfect mix of humor and action. Brie Larson brilliantly brought Carol Danvers to life in this film. A must see movie!
captain-marvel,James Kendrick,False,"Apr 17, 2019",I have to admit that I admire any superhero movie in which the hero spends at least half of her screen time wearing a faded Nine Inch Nails T-shirt
captain-marvel,Wesley Lovell,False,"Apr 16, 2019",It took too long to get a woman at the head of a Marvel Cinematic Universe film and it's about time.

captain-marvel,Alachia Queen,True,"Apr 14, 2019",Marvel gave a pretty mediocre answer to DC's Wonder Woman with this film but at least the cat was cool.
captain-marvel,Sara Clements,False,"Apr 12, 2019","Captain Marvel's reflection of the female experience, along with the themes of empowerment and the general nostalgia trip, help make the result more than just your ordinary superhero movie."
captain-marvel,Matthew Toomey,True,"Apr 9, 2019",There's no shortage of action scenes but they're heavy on special effects and light on emotional resonance.
captain-marvel,Amanda Greever,False,"Apr 8, 2019",Captain Marvel satisfying but takes a minute to hit its stride
captain-marvel,Brent Hankins,False,"Apr 8, 2019","[Captain Marvel] gives young ladies another strong role model to look up, a confident and capable woman who rails against the patriarchy and the cries of ""you don't belong here"" and emerges triumphant."
captain-marvel,Tony Norman,False,"Apr 4, 2019","... such a disappointment, though still worth seeing."
captain-marvel,Maria Lewis,False,"Apr 4, 2019","The messaging doesn't need to be subtle to be important, and Captain Marvel wears its heart firmly on its sleeve."

captain-marvel,Mark Jackson,True,"Apr 1, 2019","Samuel L. Jackson provides 99 percent of the chuckles here, but then, he does that in just about any movie he's in. Why is this movie suddenly a financial blockbuster? The only blockbuster-ness it warrants is the one Captain Marvel crash-lands in."
captain-marvel,Kay-B,False,"Apr 1, 2019",... [Captain Marvel] does manage to beautifully capture the essence of the '90s and a woman coming into her own as the superhero she was always destined to be.
captain-marvel,Preston Barta,False,"Mar 30, 2019","Captain Marvel is a fun entry weighed down by many issues. I am more excited about the possibilities of her character going forward now that we have her backstory in the books, and I only expect Larson's role to improve from here."
captain-marvel,Eli Glasner,False,"Mar 30, 2019","Besides fighting the Skrull conspiracy, she's also fighting a convoluted script. The writers do Captain Marvel no favours by tossing her origin story in the identity crisis movie blender."
captain-marvel,Stuart Klawans,False,"Mar 29, 2019","Larson makes something more than formulaic out of Vers's grit and impetuousness, Jackson takes the trouble this time to play the nuances of his character (since the filmmakers, for a change, have given him some)."
captain-marvel,Rubén Rosario,False,"Mar 29, 2019","You know it's going to be a topsy-turvy movie year when this Marvel Cinematic Universe detractor is forced to admit he enjoyed an MCU cash cow, but such is the unlikely outcome from catching up with this sneakily absorbing origin story."

captain-marvel,Amyana Bartley,False,"Mar 24, 2019","Without the input from female writers/directors like Anna Boden, this film would not have resonated so much. Its subtle and not so subtle nuances required its creators to understand how it feels to live under an oppressive thumb in every facet of life."

captain-marvel,Christopher Llewellyn Reed,False,"Mar 20, 2019","I never really like the big ensemble Marvel films, but I often enjoy their standalone movies, and this was no exception. In fact, I loved it."
captain-marvel,Molly Templeton,False,"Mar 20, 2019","Captain Marvel is about Carol - it's not about saving the world, though that happens along the way. The antagonist, a brilliantly cast Ben Mendelsohn, is not the problem. Something much bigger - and subtler - is."
captain-marvel,Robert Roten,False,"Mar 20, 2019","This is a new kind of female superhero, one who is fully comfortable in her own skin -- a funny, casual, wise cracking, cocky superhero. She's not overly serious, stiff, formal, or straining under destiny's weight. Instead, she's just fun to watch."
captain-marvel,José Martín,False,"Mar 19, 2019","Fans of the genre can breathe easy and enjoy a fantastic, hilarious adventure. [Full review in Spanish]"

captain-marvel,Lisa Johnson Mandell,False,"Mar 16, 2019","Captain Marvel almost has it all: excitement, wit, plot twists, multi-faceted villains and stunning visual effects. What it doesn't have is the gravitas of a Wonder Woman."
captain-marvel,Matt Brunson,False,"Mar 16, 2019","Ignore those imbecilic MRAs, frightened fanboys, and all other insecure man-babies shellacked in misogyny: The truth is that this film is reams of fun and, significantly, no different in quality from past solo superhero flicks produced by Marvel."
captain-marvel,Dennis Schwartz,True,"Mar 16, 2019","It's a film that aims to show-off its girl power, and does so with mixed results."
captain-marvel,Bob Grimm,True,"Mar 16, 2019",Brie Larson seems oddly detached from the proceedings.
captain-marvel,Jim Schembri,True,"Mar 16, 2019","Captain Marvel is an unremarkable, passable time killer...[Brie] Larson's performance is wooden...while the film's big action scenes are so lacking in imagination the screen often looks as though it's being continually doused in technicolour vomit."

captain-marvel,Scott Davis,False,"Mar 15, 2019","The MCU introduces a bright, brilliant light to their universe. Captain Marvel is a complete triumph, with wit, spectacle and a sense of wonder which gives the MCU's future a compelling trajectory."
captain-marvel,Sarah Knight Adamson,False,"Mar 15, 2019","Larson shines, as she's made the independently strong character her own -- serving as a role model to all young girls worldwide -- however, the scenes between her and a younger eyepatch-less Fury are my favorite."
captain-marvel,Kate Sánchez,False,"Mar 15, 2019","By setting Captain Marvel in the 90s, the filmmakers did a disservice to the importance Captain Marvel can play in the larger MCU and instead gave us a forgettable origin movie-lite."
captain-marvel,Julie Crawford,False,"Mar 14, 2019","Larson's energy makes Captain Marvel, whether she's pummeling villains with her self-satisfied smirk or radiating light in space like a blazing spectre."
captain-marvel,Tara Thorne,False,"Mar 14, 2019","Anyone who saw Larson's finely wrought work in The United States of Tara knows she is equally adept at drama and comedy and Carol Danvers is allowed both, a rarity in this universe."
captain-marvel,Andrea Thompson,False,"Mar 14, 2019","It's damn fun to see Larson as a hero coming into her own, complete with 90s staples that includes a great soundtrack and references to Blockbuster, but it's hard to get truly invested since we know so little about Carol."
captain-marvel,Lapacazo Magrira Sandoval,False,"Mar 14, 2019","This prequel has a sturdy gaze, forward."
captain-marvel,Steph Cozza,True,"Mar 14, 2019","It was lacking, a bit flat, and I'm honestly concerned about how she will enter the Marvel Cinematic Universe...it's so concerned with being a feminist film that it forgets how to be a superhero movie."
captain-marvel,Allen Adams,False,"Mar 14, 2019","Captain Marvel could have floundered under the storytelling load it was asked to shoulder, but instead manages to (mostly) soar...a worthy choice as Phase 3's penultimate offering."
captain-marvel,Micheal Compton,False,"Mar 14, 2019","A fun throwback with some nice work from Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson, as well as a great way to get audiences jazzed up for next month's big Avenger finale."
captain-marvel,Asher Luberto,True,"Mar 14, 2019","The screenplay would rather see Larson be stoic than human. She has a movie stars squint and a charisma that melts the screen, but the character, despite amiable virtue, isn't particularly relatable... there's nothing super about her."
captain-marvel,Monique Jones,False,"Mar 13, 2019",Captain Marvel is a film you should be proud to let your children watch. It will inspire them to understand there should be no limits on what women can achieve
captain-marvel,Margot Harrison,False,"Mar 13, 2019",Larson's comedy chemistry with Jackson makes for good '90s-style buddy action.
captain-marvel,Richard von Busack,False,"Mar 13, 2019","Despite some starchy Louisiana heartland sequences, this is an effective fantasy of power used with grace and without arrogance."
captain-marvel,Skylar Ezell,False,"Mar 13, 2019","While Captain Marvel does very little in terms of personal growth, she does represent a certain female fearlessness that is wonderful to experience."
captain-marvel,Tim Brayton,True,"Mar 13, 2019","An almost impenetrable slog of pulp sci-fi notions of intergalactic wars and an amnesiac supersoldier, expressed without a modicum of camp or passion."
captain-marvel,Linda Cook,False,"Mar 13, 2019",'Captain Marvel' flies onto the screen with adventure and female empowerment.
captain-marvel,Aaron Dicer,False,"Mar 13, 2019","Oh Captain, my Captain. Brie Larson brings humanity and depth to a role that could have been a typical super hero origin story but instead feels like Marvel is finding new ways to tell super stories."
captain-marvel,Linda Marric,False,"Mar 12, 2019","A hugely enjoyable, funny and masterfully put together offering from Marvel and Disney."
captain-marvel,Louisa Moore,True,"Mar 12, 2019",Why praise a movie that panders (with a symbolic pat on the head) to the audience it is supposed to empower?
captain-marvel,Richard Brody,True,"Mar 12, 2019",The problem is with the corporate anticulture that controls these productions-and the fandom-targeted demagogy that they're made to fulfill-which responsible casting can't overcome alone.
captain-marvel,Jane Hu,True,"Mar 12, 2019","Marvel films should be allowed to be mediocre and confusing, but if you are invested in how Hollywood-and superhero franchises in particular-represents female characters, then the stakes of these films shift a little."
captain-marvel,Korey Coleman,True,"Mar 12, 2019",This could have been The Usual Suspects or Momento of Marvel but... they don't develop the character in an origin film.
captain-marvel,Martin Thomas,True,"Mar 12, 2019",There's not enough on the page... it's only two hours long and they kind of rushed through it.
captain-marvel,Eleanor Ringel Cater,False,"Mar 12, 2019",Jackson hasn't seemed this engaged in years and his repartee with Larson is delightful.
captain-marvel,Víctor López G.,True,"Mar 12, 2019","A plain, lazy and insipid entry. [Full Review in Spanish]"
captain-marvel,Brian Gill,False,"Mar 12, 2019","The strong lead and the fun, nostalgic-but-not-too-nostalgic vibe floats the movie through some iffy direction and an underutilized supporting cast. This is a good launching point for something that will hopefully be great when it's all said and done."
captain-marvel,Matthew Bond,False,"Mar 12, 2019",The likeable Larson and the digitally rejuvenated Jackson soon establish a winning screen friendship and what follows is spectacular and fun.
captain-marvel,Cate Young,False,"Mar 12, 2019","The film is neither a masterpiece or a calamity; instead, it's a perfectly fun, entertaining installment in a larger narrative arc that's very clearly working to set up the MCU's evolution into its next phase."

captain-marvel,L.E.H Light,False,"Mar 12, 2019",Danvers is a hero worth stanning for. And all indications are that the movie gives her the space to shine.
captain-marvel,S. Indra Sathiabalan,False,"Mar 12, 2019","Nonetheless, I was prepared to enjoy Captain Marvel, the same way I enjoyed previous solo superhero films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.I am not going to say I was disappointed, but neither am I going to say I thoroughly enjoyed myself."
captain-marvel,Kent Garrison,False,"Mar 12, 2019","Captain Marvel brings a fresh jolt of energy to the MCU. If Brie Larson doesn't win you over, the cat certainly will."
captain-marvel,Tom Glasson,False,"Mar 12, 2019","21 Marvel films to get our first female-led offering was an unforgivable delay, especially for something that plays it so safe."
captain-marvel,Pablo Villaça,False,"Mar 12, 2019","It's perfectly possible to point out the narrative hiccups of the movie and, at the same time, to stress how important its existence and success are. [Full review in Portuguese]"
captain-marvel,Kristy Strouse,False,"Mar 12, 2019","Underneath the important sign of Woman and Hero is a worthy, visually appeasing and well-acted addition to the comic book genre."
captain-marvel,Amie Simon,False,"Mar 12, 2019","There are so many great scenes here, but also an incredibly amazing moment when you see Carol Danvers throw off the last of her doubts and realize the full extent of her power and IT IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I'VE EVER SEEN ON SCREEN."
captain-marvel,Matt Hudson,False,"Mar 11, 2019","Larson grabs the role and locks it in her soul, however, the rest of the movie isn't up to her standard. A solid, enjoyable, yet flawed romp towards the next phase of the MCU."
captain-marvel,Lauren Humphries-Brooks,False,"Mar 11, 2019","Above all, Captain Marvel moves with a confidence that proclaims it has nothing to prove. The future of Marvel is female, and you can either accept that or get out of the way."
captain-marvel,Kt Schaefer,False,"Mar 11, 2019","Great visual effects and acting by Brie Larson make for an enjoyable watch that embraces a confident and smart woman character, something rarely seen in this genre."
captain-marvel,Kirk Baird,False,"Mar 11, 2019",But Captain Marvel succeeds where it is most needed. It injects a truly badass superheroine played by an overjoyed Larson into the MCU.
captain-marvel,Mark Kermode,False,"Mar 11, 2019",I thought it was perfectly fine.
captain-marvel,Michael Medved,True,"Mar 11, 2019",It's hard to see that anyone will think this is one of the better entries into the Marvel universe.
captain-marvel,Emmanuel Báez,False,"Mar 11, 2019",Brie Larson fits perfectly in this world of superheroes. [Full review in Spanish]

captain-marvel,Ani Bundel,False,"Mar 11, 2019",A relatively good superhero blockbuster - and it's not trying to be anything more than that.
captain-marvel,Edward Porter,False,"Mar 11, 2019","Still, the exploits of a ginger cat add a distinctive touch of comedy; and the feminist message in the protagonist's self-discovery is endearing, partly because it's never overstated."
captain-marvel,Aine O'Connor,False,"Mar 11, 2019","Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck co-write and direct this fun and funny, clever, diversity-embracing episode. Captain Marvel enjoys her powers, Larson brings warmth to the ass-whooping."
captain-marvel,Sebastian Zavala Kahn,False,"Mar 11, 2019",I'd like to see these actors and their characters in a better-written and better-directed film. The end result would be much more spectacular. [Full review in Spanish]
captain-marvel,Damian Levy,False,"Mar 11, 2019","The whole time watching the film, I wanted to spend more time with its hero."
captain-marvel,Ella Kemp,True,"Mar 11, 2019",The first Marvel woman to show signs of heroism is given little more than a proton blast to develop her personality.
captain-marvel,Pamela Powell,False,"Mar 11, 2019","Those of us who have had our fill of this genre will still enjoy the message it sends, with great character development and interaction connecting us to the characters and creating a strong female lead."
captain-marvel,Christopher Machell,False,"Mar 11, 2019","Captain Marvel succeeds as a rollicking-good film in its own right. Accessible to newbies and satisfying to fans, it's about time that brilliant performers like Larson were given their time in the spotlight."
captain-marvel,AJ Caulfield,False,"Mar 11, 2019","When stacked up next to the MCU movies that came before it, Captain Marvel gleams with a high shine."
captain-marvel,Kim Newman,False,"Mar 11, 2019","Given the unholy mess of Carol's continuity, the film's multi-authored script makes a fair fist of delivering fragments of backstory as recovered memory."
captain-marvel,Peter Rainer,True,"Mar 11, 2019","Lacking the wit and graphic oomph that sometimes rescues the Marvel franchise from terminal fatigue, ""Captain Marvel"" is yet another origin story for yet another superhero."
captain-marvel,Matt Ward,False,"Mar 11, 2019",Captain Marvel is a good movie that will inspire young girls to strive for the best versions of themselves. It just isn't one audiences have to fight through crowds to see.
captain-marvel,Lauren Veneziani,False,"Mar 11, 2019",The eagerly anticipated  Captain Marvel  features a supporting cast worthy of several sequels and a cat more memorable than its lead star.
captain-marvel,Cameron Frew,False,"Mar 11, 2019","A distinctly Phase One pre-Endgame appetiser, progressive and thematically powerful in areas missing a little wonder."
captain-marvel,Ed Whitfield,True,"Mar 11, 2019","If Captain Marvel had been lovingly crafted and shot with style, perhaps the void at its heart would have mattered less. But Larson's fighter pilot, turned galactic defender, is the central character a characterless movie deserves."
captain-marvel,Reginald Ponder,False,"Mar 11, 2019",Brie Larson is truly the Captain of this ship. And while this is a worthy voyage the story falls short of MARVEL-ous.
captain-marvel,Sarah Gopaul,False,"Mar 11, 2019","Rather than change the way comic book movies depict women, this picture makes a standard superhero movie with a female protagonist."
captain-marvel,Tim Martain,False,"Mar 11, 2019","This superhero movie probably does have something to prove but proves it by not really seeming to care whether it does so or not, which I think is a fantastic kind of protest."

captain-marvel,Edward Douglas,False,"Mar 10, 2019","Captain Marvel does the job it was meant to do, and I can understand how some people might like it more than others."

captain-marvel,Nathalia Aryani,False,"Mar 10, 2019","All the familiarity of a Marvel movie and cleverly tied to the cohesive and expansive universe. Yet from a storytelling perspective, it's refreshingly different. Captain Marvel is an entertaining blast from the past and marvelously empowering."
captain-marvel,Tim Brennan,False,"Mar 10, 2019","I don't think that Captain Marvel is going to strike the culture like a metaphorical Mjolnir. It doesn't have to since it's a well-made standalone adventure, as well as a comfortable piece in the tapestry of the MCU."
captain-marvel,Di Golding,False,"Mar 10, 2019",Beyond the 90s aesthetic Captain Marvel harkens back to an age in action cinema when not every single minute of film needed to be filled with exposition or seizure-inducing CGI spectacles to engage an audience.
captain-marvel,Lauren Bradshaw,False,"Mar 10, 2019","Captain Marvel is a retro-tastic origin story worthy of its namesake, capturing the strength and heart of the comics."
captain-marvel,Joel Mayward,False,"Mar 10, 2019",It's marvelous.
captain-marvel,MaryAnn Johanson,False,"Mar 10, 2019","An indie ethos comes to the comic-book movie, upending the origin story and offering a female superhero who throws out the boys' rule book, goes her own way, and stalks among us with easy confidence."

captain-marvel,Wendy Ide,False,"Mar 10, 2019",The main strength is a core of female friendship: Carol Danvers is the only Marvel hero you could imagine getting hammered and belting out songs by No Doubt.

captain-marvel,Courtney Small,False,"Mar 10, 2019","As Marvel's first female led film, Captain Marvel is equally empowering and frustrating."

captain-marvel,Michelle Alexandria,False,"Mar 9, 2019","Usually Marvel origin films have trouble sticking the landing, but Captain Marvel is just the opposite, it feels like it takes off in the 3rd act and becomes a near flawless action movie that kicks Phase IV into overdrive."
captain-marvel,Katherine Monk,False,"Mar 9, 2019","Brie Larson has such a command over our empathy, she redeems the awkwardly written moments of emotional poignancy, as well as the comic-book, time-space mumbo-jumbo that tends to make my eyes glaze over and my ears shut down."
captain-marvel,Rendy Jones,False,"Mar 9, 2019","The narrative is very predictable, but it's earned through its humor and fun performances rather than its storytelling which is the formula Marvel coasted by with for years."
captain-marvel,Sarah Cartland,False,"Mar 9, 2019","Entertaining, witty and sincere, it only loses out on excitement because Captain Marvel is just so capable. There's always a supporting character threatening to take over though and this time it's Goose the cat: the Fury-furry relationship is a highlight."
captain-marvel,Benjamin Gummery,False,"Mar 9, 2019",Overall the films pace did derail at times but ultimately is a strong first effort for Marvel's first Female-fronted film and has all the fun and joy we have come to know and love from the MCU. Larson's performance in this film is a high point!
captain-marvel,Leonard Maltin,False,"Mar 9, 2019","As a parent, I wish a film like this had been made when my daughter was young. In Captain Marvel, Brie Larson plays a woman who comes to learn that the most important power she possesses has been inside her all along"
captain-marvel,Jeff Beck,True,"Mar 9, 2019","It really all comes down to the ho-hum writing. It's far from the worst film in the MCU, but don't be surprised if you find yourself not getting as invested as usual, or if the film ends up fading from memory faster than others."
captain-marvel,Diva Velez,True,"Mar 9, 2019","While not the worst of the MCU, CAPTAIN MARVEL is so much less than it should've been. Even Goose the Flerken can't save it from a lacking lead performance, dull action, awful VFX, and a clichéd, amateurish script."
captain-marvel,Bob Chipman,False,"Mar 9, 2019","Starts out like 'Star Wars,' morphs into kind of a Riot Grrl 'Flight of The Navigator' and then turns into 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' once it heads back out into space."
captain-marvel,Heather Hogan,False,"Mar 9, 2019","A slow start, but once the movie got going, it left me breathless."
captain-marvel,Rob Vaux,False,"Mar 9, 2019",They cast Brie Larson and let the rest take care of itself.

captain-marvel,Jennifer Heaton,False,"Mar 9, 2019","It embraces its female empowerment narrative without needing to belabour it, putting forward an entertaining story first and lacing in its timely subtext as a bonus."
captain-marvel,Kristian Harloff,False,"Mar 9, 2019","A fun, adventurous space romp. I had some popcorn, I dug it. Would I want to see another one? Yes, but I have a lot of questions...good questions."

captain-marvel,Chris Stuckmann,True,"Mar 9, 2019","It feels like a stepping-stone movie, not the powerful one we hoped for."
captain-marvel,John Tones,True,"Mar 9, 2019",Some aesthetic and narrative reluctance makes the film seem more like a rushed production to present the character before Avengers: Endgame. [Full Review in Spanish]
captain-marvel,Jaby Koay,False,"Mar 9, 2019","Overall, I think that it's worth watching for sure."
captain-marvel,Sergio López Aguirre,True,"Mar 9, 2019",The Brie Larson film has more similarities with Phase 1 MCU and it's not necessarily a bad thing. but it does feel like a step backwards. [Full Review in Spanish]
captain-marvel,Molly Laich,True,"Mar 9, 2019","Brie Larson isn't working with much, but still, does she have to deliver every line with such stony resignation?"
captain-marvel,Jamal Grootboom,False,"Mar 9, 2019","At this point, Marvel Studios can do no wrong and Captain Marvel is not only a great stand-alone film but also gives some established characters more depth."

captain-marvel,Melalin Mahavongtrakul,False,"Mar 8, 2019","Overall the inaugural take of Danvers in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a fun, entertaining ride that we are definitely rooting for more as we go further into a new phase following Endgame."
captain-marvel,Matt Miller,False,"Mar 8, 2019",Captain Marvel does struggle to break out of the greater MCU. But what counts is that this is a story that manages to re-write the established canon of Marvel history that provides something fresh and new.
captain-marvel,Rick Bentley,True,"Mar 8, 2019",The efforts to mix massive action scenes with down-to-Earth humor is less of the smooth transition it needs to be to work and more of a jarring trek.
captain-marvel,Chris Gore,True,"Mar 8, 2019","This is by far, the worst Marvel movie since... well, pre-MCU movies or TV like when Thor appeared on The Incredible Hulk TV show way back when."
captain-marvel,Hunter Lanier,False,"Mar 8, 2019","Captain Marvel feels like the complimentary bread before the big meal. It's bland and not what you're waiting on, but it's well-made and satisfying in the moment."
captain-marvel,Alex Saveliev,False,"Mar 8, 2019","Captain Marvel allows its indie directors to apply a touch of poignancy here, an artistic brush-stroke there - but mostly it's a by-the-numbers affair. That being said, it will most likely elate Marvel fans."
captain-marvel,Alan Ng,False,"Mar 8, 2019","Ultimately, I liked Captain Marvel, but I can see how it will piss off the hardcore Marvel fan."
captain-marvel,Lorry Kikta,False,"Mar 8, 2019",I'd say it's on par with Thor: Ragnarok for being a mostly jovial entry into the MCU and I like it just about as much. I also can't wait to see what Larson brings to the table in Avengers: End Game.
captain-marvel,Annlee Ellingson,False,"Mar 8, 2019","An unabashed anthem about women's self-empowerment, as Vers ... claims not only the full scope of her abilities but the strength that comes from acting from her heart."
captain-marvel,Devesh Sharma,False,"Mar 8, 2019","Superhero portrayals are tricky but [Larson] has kind of mastered the trick, and has you rooting for her, and that's the actor's real superpower alright..."

captain-marvel,Alan French,False,"Mar 8, 2019","While Marvel really needed to focus on building this one character (instead of many at once), the power of Larson, Jackson, and more pull the picture together."
captain-marvel,Roxana Hadadi,False,"Mar 8, 2019",Captain Marvel succeeds not only as an introduction to a new Marvel hero but as a time at the movies that is consistently interested in what it feels like to be a girl and a woman.
captain-marvel,Vladimir Jean-Gilles,True,"Mar 8, 2019","Surprisingly, the most disappointing thing about Captain Marvel is Captain Marvel herself."
captain-marvel,Eric D. Snider,False,"Mar 8, 2019","A middling, good-enough episode... The dynamic between Larson and Jackson is lively."

captain-marvel,Stephen Rebello,True,"Mar 8, 2019","Captain Marvel isn't a pain to sit through...but such a venerable character long overdue on the big screen, the talents involved in putting her there and Marvel's rabidly faithful international audience deserved much better."
captain-marvel,Melissa Leon,False,"Mar 8, 2019","Its adherence to the tried-and-true conventions of a Phase One Marvel origin story, 10 years into an increasingly complex cinematic universe, might leave you neither overjoyed nor underwhelmed, but satisfied and wondering what's for dinner."
captain-marvel,Rashid Irani,True,"Mar 8, 2019","Almost everything about Captain Marvel tends towards the sub-standard, from the special effects to the action sequences, the scattershot storytelling and the slapstick."
captain-marvel,Rohan Naahar,True,"Mar 8, 2019","Unfortunately, Captain Marvel, for lack of a better description, is just another Marvel movie - set to a robotic, unmemorable score; deeply reliant on old tropes; and featuring yet another underwhelming villain."

captain-marvel,Alex Doenau,True,"Mar 8, 2019","It is unfortunate that Danvers can fly effortlessly and Samuel L. Jackson can almost recapture his younger self, but the movie cannot stretch itself to make computer-generated cables and flying cats seem natural."
captain-marvel,Nate Adams,False,"Mar 8, 2019","Captain Marvel is a messy origin tale that struggles to figure out what to do with its main character. Thankfully, the film finds its cinematic footing late in the third act. It should also be said: the cat rocks."
captain-marvel,Tony Medley,True,"Mar 8, 2019","...undistinguishable from the other superhero films, except that the superhero is a woman. Apparently that's are enough to satisfy the prosaic 21st Century mind."

captain-marvel,James Verniere,True,"Mar 8, 2019","Captain Marvel could not be duller beside DC's Wonder Woman if she tried. Apparently, personality is not the Captain's superpower."

captain-marvel,Matthew Lickona,True,"Mar 8, 2019","The film may be about women breaking their shackles, but the lead actress feels kept in check for much of the picture.

captain-marvel,Marisa Carpico,False,"Mar 8, 2019",She's cool and she knows it and one of the film's greatest joys is watching Larson swagger around and verbally out-spar Jackson.
captain-marvel,Rain Jokinen,False,"Mar 8, 2019",[The] 90's is the perfect era for Captain Marvel to land in. It was the last time women could make noise without having to immediately hear a response from a dozen men screaming about their own alleged suppression. (The Internet ruined everything.)

captain-marvel,Johnny Gayzmonic,False,"Mar 8, 2019","There's a lack of Marvel bombast, but it's replaced by a focus on natural and unforced character interaction. It's a down-to-earth film about a cosmically-powered hero."

captain-marvel,Rubin Safaya,False,"Mar 8, 2019","A theme emerges of marginalized people trying to make it in someone else's world. How we get there isn't through tropes and brow-beatings, but through honest dialogue after the chase sequences and fist-fights prove futile."

captain-marvel,Colby Bryant,False,"Mar 8, 2019",An interesting premise... (with) nostalgic packaging. Enjoy Captain Marvel for what it is: an oddly fun character introduction with charm and imperfections all its own.

captain-marvel,Daniel M. Kimmel,False,"Mar 8, 2019",Larson has to play a character who is both reclaiming her past and discovering her future. It's a surprisingly complex role which may be why some fans have been put off by it.

captain-marvel,Adam Graham,True,"Mar 8, 2019","In the grand scheme of the Marvel Universe, however, ""Captain Marvel"" feels like a supporting player, not a featured attraction."
captain-marvel,Chris Newbould,False,"Mar 8, 2019",There really should be an extra gold medal issued for the way the film successfully brings in the equally topical matter of attitudes to refugees when we were least expecting it.
captain-marvel,Shyama Krishna Kumar,False,"Mar 7, 2019",Larson and Jackson also share easy-going chemistry that sets the general tone of the film quite early on.
captain-marvel,Bob Bloom,False,"Mar 7, 2019","'Captain Marvel,' set in the mid-1990s, is not the best offering from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's like an old car on a freezing, winter day. It sputters when you start it, but gradually warms up and hits on all cylinders."

captain-marvel,Robert Denerstein,True,"Mar 7, 2019","Captain Marvel tries to zip and zap its way into the pop-cultural canon... Some, I suppose, will enjoy the frenzy, but for me, the point turns out to be inadvertent: Incessant movement doesn't necessarily get you anywhere."

captain-marvel,Diego Batlle,False,"Mar 7, 2019","Beyond the praiseworthy change of paradigm, Captain Marvel is a pretty classic bet and in certain aspects conventional. [Full Review in Spanish]"
captain-marvel,Josh Bell,False,"Mar 7, 2019","A movie that could have been bold and iconic, but instead settles for good enough."
captain-marvel,Kenneth R. Morefield,False,"Mar 7, 2019",Aren't these movies supposed to be interchangeable? Isn't that the point?
captain-marvel,Dana Barbuto,False,"Mar 7, 2019","""Captain Marvel"" end ups somewhere between empowering and entertaining, because when you strip away the bombastic comic-book accoutrements, ""Captain Marvel"" is a simple story of female strength, friendship and identity. Sign me up."
captain-marvel,Kristian M. Lin,False,"Mar 7, 2019","Somehow, I feel like [Captain Marvel's] going to pound Thanos straight into the ground. I would enjoy that."
captain-marvel,Jim Judy,False,"Mar 7, 2019","It sort of feels like second-rate Marvel -- certainly not horrible by any means and clearly entertaining enough, just not up to the lofty standards we've come to expect. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
captain-marvel,Josh Larsen,False,"Mar 7, 2019","Just when I think my MCU exhaustion is almost complete, Captain Marvel arrives to pull me back in."
captain-marvel,Juanma Fernández París,False,"Mar 7, 2019","However, [Captain Marvel's] best quality lies in how the film seeks to emulate the way comics managed to comment on the current social and cultural landscape. [Full Review in Spanish]"
captain-marvel,Akhil Arora,True,"Mar 7, 2019","As it is, Captain Marvel is more a reminder of Marvel's early work (think the first Captain America or Thor) than its more recent output (Black Panther or Infinity War)."
captain-marvel,Jeffrey M. Anderson,False,"Mar 7, 2019","In the end, it has a girl-power zing that lifts and exhilarates."
captain-marvel,Gaspar Zimerman,False,"Mar 7, 2019",The tone is equidistant between the farce of Thor: Ragnarok and the seriousness of Black Panther. [Full review in Spanish]
captain-marvel,J.R. Kinnard,True,"Mar 7, 2019","Ultimately, Captain Marvel is one of Marvel's most baffling missteps."
captain-marvel,Alistair Harkness,False,"Mar 7, 2019","[Larson] quickly comes into her own in a role that, despite the limitations of the franchise, never quite conforms to superhero conventions."
captain-marvel,Joe Friar,False,"Mar 7, 2019",Plenty of humor and action make this an immensely entertaining thrill ride. Captain Marvel is a blast.
captain-marvel,Demetrios Matheou,False,"Mar 7, 2019","With Captain Marvel the studio combines the two elements, resulting in one of the more breezily enjoyable and emotionally satisfying of the franchise."
captain-marvel,Zaki Hasan,True,"Mar 7, 2019",A rare misstep from a franchise factory that otherwise strides the movie landscape so assuredly.
captain-marvel,Sara Michelle Fetters,False,"Mar 7, 2019",The whole thing is so consistently entertaining it practically doesn't matter that not every piece makes as much logical sense as it probably should.
captain-marvel,Paul Whitington,False,"Mar 7, 2019","We wanted less of all that faux mythology, more of the hand-to-hand fighting and coy pop cultural references, and more opportunities for Brie Larson to show off her comic timing. Captain Marvel is good, but could easily have been better."
captain-marvel,Sherilyn Connelly,False,"Mar 7, 2019","Though there's plenty of punching and brrap-brrap-pew-pew, the true emotional core is her friendship with Rambeau, and if Captain Marvel inspires just one girl to become a USAF pilot, it'll all have been worth it."
captain-marvel,Dominic Corry,False,"Mar 7, 2019","Nicely balancing the Earth-bound elements with epic cosmic action, Captain Marvel is yet another winner from the house of M."
captain-marvel,Jesse Hassenger,False,"Mar 7, 2019","What really stands out about Captain Marvel, then, is its approach to its hero's origin. Unlike Marvel's typically heavy-handed exposition, this movie only hints at a backstory it never truly reveals. The restraint is refreshing."
captain-marvel,Don Shanahan,False,"Mar 7, 2019","Let loose, as she does, and relish in the unbridled power of this new MCU entry that wrinkles the blueprint with fantastic feminine wiles."
captain-marvel,Witney Seibold,True,"Mar 7, 2019",Captain Marvel is bright and entertaining on a basic level. But it's also something we may not have seen before: An MCU film that's kind of forgettable.
captain-marvel,Tom Meek,False,"Mar 7, 2019","The film, unlike many in the genre, actually builds in intrigue as it powers on."
captain-marvel,Iain McNally,False,"Mar 7, 2019","By no means bad, Captain Marvel is still an enjoyable space-slash-superhero adventure, but Carol Danvers might have been better served by being introduced a little earlier in the release order."
captain-marvel,Caryn James,False,"Mar 7, 2019","Captain Marvel may be good enough to satisfy the series' built-in audience, but might disappoint anyone expecting more."
captain-marvel,Deborah Ross,False,"Mar 7, 2019","Look, while this is less inventive than you hoped (and prayed), it is an improvement, with Larson proving she can more than carry a film of this type."
captain-marvel,Anne Brodie,True,"Mar 7, 2019","The characters display recognisable humanity which is the film's balance but not often enough or convincingly. There's something dark and empty in all the fanfare and fuss, and it seems aimed solely at an audience that grew up in video arcades."
captain-marvel,John Urbancich,False,"Mar 7, 2019",A somewhat fluffy final act still offers enough distaff derring-do in plenty of time for Friday's celebration of International Women's Day.
captain-marvel,Bruce DeMara,False,"Mar 7, 2019","The film looks great on an IMAX screen, Larson is sublime and the fantastical plot is buoyed throughout with lots of good-natured humour - reason enough to wish a return engagement for Captain Marvel."
captain-marvel,Roger Tennis,False,"Mar 7, 2019",'Captain Marvel' earns its stripes in the MCU.
captain-marvel,Walter Chaw,True,"Mar 7, 2019","The characters are undeveloped, the outlines of this universe are vague and uninteresting, and the less said about the multiple attempts at humour, the better."

captain-marvel,Chris Hewitt,False,"Mar 7, 2019","Captain Marvel is such a welcome and appealing addition to the Marvel universe that I wish she could be added, retroactively, to all of the extant ""Avengers"" movies."
captain-marvel,Charles Koplinski,False,"Mar 7, 2019","Her quest is a well-executed one of universal appeal, so much so that the fact she can shoot proton beams seems of little import."
captain-marvel,Kyle Wilson,False,"Mar 7, 2019","A surprising amount of humor served with a heaping of 90s nostalgia, but suffers from a less-than-perfect origin story."
captain-marvel,Gary Thompson,True,"Mar 7, 2019","Years from now, chances are that when people sit around and talk enthusiastically about that movie with Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson, the subject is most likely to be Kong: Skull Island."
captain-marvel,Carl Kozlowski,False,"Mar 7, 2019","Plenty of other Easter eggs abound throughout, but the only wish I have is that this and future MCU movies remember to keep the human side as strong as the super heroics and not devolve into murky mayhem when the action hits."
captain-marvel,Jo Berry,False,"Mar 7, 2019","It's not the best Marvel movie, but at the centre of it all is the terrific Larson, every inch the heroine we wanted her to be..."
captain-marvel,Max Weiss,False,"Mar 7, 2019",Captain Marvel didn't markedly improve the experience for me. I enjoyed it well enough. It felt...familiar.
captain-marvel,Dwight Brown,True,"Mar 7, 2019",Captain Marvel rates a C. It's distinguished from other MCU movies by its female lead. Otherwise it is way too ordinary and middle of the pack.
captain-marvel,Mario Alegre,True,"Mar 7, 2019","You would think that after 21 feature films, Marvel would have perfected the superhero origin story formula, but to Brie Larson's detriment, this time they forgot to add ""character"" and ""personality"" into the mix. [Full Review in Spanish]"
captain-marvel,Josh Terry,False,"Mar 7, 2019","It's hard to find much of anything too disappointing about Boden and Fleck's new film. The only real letdown might be fans' realization that they still have to wait another few months till ""Endgame"" hits theaters."
captain-marvel,Andrew Wyatt,True,"Mar 7, 2019","The feature's gender politics feel like a bit of a pose: too superficial to convey the source material's fiercely feminist mythology, and too desperate for applause for it to be regarded as sincere."
captain-marvel,Matthew Turner,False,"Mar 7, 2019","A fun '90s-set adventure that delivers action, emotion and humour in the mighty Marvel manner."
captain-marvel,Christopher Lloyd,False,"Mar 7, 2019",An uneven but passionate and energetic introduction for a figure some have called the most powerful hero in the MCU.

captain-marvel,Neil Pond,False,"Mar 7, 2019","Soars as an origin story with heart, cheeky humor, wit and warmth, zingy dialogue, punchy action, colorful characters and a hero--heroine--who breaks the glass ceiling on two worlds."

captain-marvel,Matt Neal,False,"Mar 7, 2019","A funny and fun introduction to a mighty Avenger. It has flaws, but they only stand out because other MCU films have done these things better."

captain-marvel,Brad Keefe,True,"Mar 7, 2019","It's not fair to give ""Captain Marvel,"" a perfectly passable popcorn movie, the full weight of the obscenity of this cinematic gender disparity. But after this wait, society deserved better."
captain-marvel,Randy Shulman,False,"Mar 7, 2019",It's not going out on a limb to say Goose the cat is reason enough to see the movie multiple times. But there are other joys in Captain Marvel. An abundance of them.
captain-marvel,Frank Swietek,True,"Mar 7, 2019",Far from marvelous...a stumble in Marvel-Disney's plan to conquer the cinematic universe.
captain-marvel,Megan Basham,True,"Mar 7, 2019","To be blunt, it's insulting that Marvel felt simply making its first leading woman ""one tough chick"" would be enough to placate female fans."
captain-marvel,John Wenzel,False,"Mar 7, 2019","Larson can turn a moment as slight as walking into frame and blowing a strand of hair out of her face into an uproarious, powerful visual beat."
captain-marvel,David Bax,True,"Mar 7, 2019","We may learn Vers' true name and how she came to be a Kree warrior but we never learn enough about who she is, flaws and all, to make her anything more than another interchangeable hero in a shiny suit."
captain-marvel,Kaely Monahan,False,"Mar 6, 2019","Eleven years after Robert Downey Jr. first strutted on the silver screen as Iron Man, Marvel has finally given us a female superhero. Brie Larson shines as Captain Marvel."
captain-marvel,John Lui,False,"Mar 6, 2019",The Marvel Cinematic Universe's first woman-driven movie has taken much too long to arrive. That it is here at all is cause for celebration. A pity then that it sticks to the tried and tested.

captain-marvel,Matthew Razak,False,"Mar 6, 2019","In a world where Marvel films are now Oscar contenders and we've seen nearly every Avenger onscreen in the same movie, how do we set the baseline for what a good Marvel film is?"
captain-marvel,Greg Maki,False,"Mar 6, 2019","While it's impossible to look at any Marvel product without considering how it fits into the larger puzzle, ""Captain Marvel,"" much like last year's ""Black Panther,"" deserves to stand on its own as much as it can."
captain-marvel,Oliver Jones,False,"Mar 6, 2019","While it may be a Marvel movie, it shares a deeper spiritual DNA with movies like Memento and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, than it does, say, Ant-Man."
captain-marvel,Sarah McIntyre,False,"Mar 6, 2019","Brie Larson steps into Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel's boots for the first time and it's a blast to see the Room Oscar-winner transform into a superhero in this solidly entertaining, if regrettably conventional, origins story."
captain-marvel,Ryan Gilbey,False,"Mar 6, 2019","Vital to the success of Captain Marvel is Larson, whose amused intelligence warms the movie through like Carol's hands heating a kettle."
captain-marvel,Glenn Heath Jr.,False,"Mar 6, 2019",This is a stand alone film that actually stands alone. Captain Marvel may not be subtle or stylistically innovative -- or even particularly great for that matter -- but I'll still be excited to show it to my daughter once she's old enough.

captain-marvel,Sean Collier,False,"Mar 6, 2019","An eminently fun and thoroughly enjoyable picture that ... establishes Captain Marvel, in the supremely qualified hands of Larson, as an Avenger nonpareil."
captain-marvel,Brian Orndorf,True,"Mar 6, 2019","Perhaps in the hands of other directors, Carol might turn out to be an eye-popping force of costumed law enforcement. However, for her first adventure, ""Captain Marvel"" leaves much to be desired."
captain-marvel,Donald Clarke,False,"Mar 6, 2019",It is such a shame this film isn't a little better...t's decent mid-ranking Marvel. Most fans will find something to like. It's got a great cat. No horses are scared.

captain-marvel,Sean Burns,True,"Mar 6, 2019",Hearing a Nirvana song in a Marvel movie on the day Luke Perry died felt like a dire reckoning for this Gen Xer.
captain-marvel,Louise Keller,False,"Mar 6, 2019","A new kick-ass heroine, a cat called Goose and Samuel L. Jackson as a young Nick Fury are the best things about this spectacular action-packed adventure from the Marvel cinematic universe."
captain-marvel,Nigel Andrews,False,"Mar 6, 2019","The movie alternates between the exhaustingly samey (crash, bag, flash, kerpow) and the refreshingly let's-shrug-and-have-some-quiet-moments. It is a relief to have a skilled under-actor in the main role."
captain-marvel,Min-sik Yoon,False,"Mar 6, 2019","Despite its flaws, the film is a decent superhero flick, and has the potential to take off to new heights with more character development."
captain-marvel,Simon Miraudo,False,"Mar 6, 2019","An MCU future centred on Carol Danvers could be a bright one indeed. But as Captain Marvel reminds us, especially with its haunting glimpse at the haircuts of 1995, some pasts need to be overcome on the way to greatness."

captain-marvel,Ciaran Kerr,False,"Mar 6, 2019",Captain Marvel has given us an engaging female character that does not come off as an empty 'agenda'. Larson's magnetic performance paired with an entertaining buddy-cop romp and some character moments makes this another strong entry into the MCU.

captain-marvel,Jonathan W. Hickman,False,"Mar 5, 2019","It's meant to show the lighter, more family-friendly side of the MCU, and to that extent, younger viewers should be pleased. But there are no lump-in-your throat moments in ""Captain Marvel."""

captain-marvel,Peter Travers,False,"Mar 5, 2019",You could ding it for convoluted plotting and a retro style that flattens the usual Marvel fireworks. But a dynamite Brie Larson gives hell to cosmic villains and sexist trolls. And an orange feline named Goose is the best movie cat ever!

captain-marvel,Ann Hornaday,False,"Mar 5, 2019","As shaky and unfocused as Captain Marvel often seems, it manages to reach its destination with confidence. In the end, Larson sticks the landing, albeit with something more muted than absolute triumph."
captain-marvel,Jason Guerrasio,False,"Mar 5, 2019","""Captain Marvel"" is a lot of things: a buddy movie, a '90s nostalgic coming-of-age tale, a superhero origin story. This mix can be jarring at times, but it hits its stride when the movie tells a story that doesn't follow the blueprint of most MCU titles."
captain-marvel,Kevin Maher,True,"Mar 5, 2019","They've made a Marvel blockbuster that, like its central character, is entirely free of personality."

captain-marvel,Emma Simmonds,False,"Mar 5, 2019","Larson makes it fly with her easy charm, grungy style and credible, sometimes effortless ass-whooping; one thing's for sure, she shoots straight to the top of the league as Marvel's coolest customer."
captain-marvel,A.O. Scott,False,"Mar 5, 2019","It's not too long, not too self-important, and benefits from the craft and talent of a cast that includes Annette Bening, Jude Law and Ben Mendelsohn."

captain-marvel,Carla Renata,False,"Mar 5, 2019","Captain Marvel is here in the form of Brie Larson, who is kicking intergalactic booty and I'm here for all of it! The chemistry and banter between Danvers and Fury is quick-witted and a highlight"

captain-marvel,Joshua Rothkopf,True,"Mar 5, 2019","Scenes between Fury and Larson's Carol Danvers, rediscovering her human past, are oddly inert, and the film's much-vaunted feminism, promised in months of run-up advertising and interviews, gets short-shrift."

doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness,Mark Feeney,True,"May 3, 2022","A useful rule of thumb in watching “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” is that if Cumberbatch (or Wong) isn’t in a scene, go for popcorn... the plot will be almost impossible to follow.

Cumberbatch & Olsen do a lot of heavy lifting despite being undercut by director Raimi and writer Waldron. Oddly, hit show WandaVision seems largely ignored. Very good mid credits scene."

doctor-strange,Jacob Oller,False,"Aug 27, 2018","The parts might seem (sometimes problematically) familiar, but there's new magic here."
doctor-strange,Alison Rowat,False,"Aug 23, 2018","Cumberbatch - startled otter looks, goatee and all - duly nails the part of the good-ish Doctor from the off."
doctor-strange,Mae Abdulbaki,False,"Aug 22, 2018","""Doctor Strange"" works when it wants to and it's two hours of general enjoyment; however, as the plot inches towards the end, the film begins to rely heavily on Marvel's comfortable setup to move it forward."
doctor-strange,Stephanie Cooke,False,"Aug 21, 2018","I wasn't super jazzed about Cumberbatch. SO, that being said, I think he did a fantastic job in the role."
doctor-strange,Rich Juzwiak,False,"Jun 13, 2018","Performances are strong, with Cumberbatch at peak charm-he seems to channel Harrison Ford as Han Solo here and Doctor Strange is genuinely funny."
doctor-strange,Annalee Newitz,False,"May 22, 2018","Certainly Doctor Strange isn't perfect, but the fast-paced fun generally makes up for some of the lazy worldbuilding. And the best part is that the movie never gets too silly and never gets too dark."
doctor-strange,Damian Levy,False,"May 9, 2018","It's by far one of the most visually interesting films out this year, with a world filled with new concepts that I left the film convinced of, thanks to the compelling visuals."
doctor-strange,Oggs Cruz,False,"Apr 4, 2018","From the perspective of pure visual pleasure, Doctor Strange certainly delivers. There is more than enough razzle-dazzle to deflect all the mumbo-jumbo that covers its overly familiar roots."
doctor-strange,Ruben Peralta Rigaud,False,"Apr 3, 2018","Benedict Cumberbatch gives, above all, a very personal touch to the arrogant doctor... [Full review in Spanish]"
doctor-strange,Eli Glasner,False,"Mar 21, 2018",Doctor Strange's magical battles turn Manhattan into a concrete kaleidoscope - worth watching on the biggest screen you can find.
doctor-strange,Andre Meadows,False,"Feb 22, 2018","What I particularly liked about any elements that this movie adds to the MCU, is that it does so in a way that feels organic."
doctor-strange,Megan Basham,False,"Feb 22, 2018","Buoyed by magnetic performances from Cumberbatch (sporting an American accent!) and Swinton, Derrickson takes exhilarating visual and storytelling risks and carries the genre to new heights."
doctor-strange,Jeremy Jahns,False,"Jan 27, 2018",The way they use magic for fights is where the unique nature of this film lies.
doctor-strange,Steph Cozza,False,"Jan 23, 2018",One of my favorite Marvel movies ever.
doctor-strange,James Plath,False,"Jan 16, 2018","Benedict Cumberbatch might not fit the leading man profile, but he wears the Doctor Strange uniform well."
doctor-strange,Rebecca Addison,False,"Dec 13, 2017","While the intricacies of the mystical world can be confusing at times, our introduction to this side of the Marvel Universe makes for a thoroughly enjoyable viewing experience, thanks to dazzling 3-D visual effects."
doctor-strange,Neil Soans,False,"Nov 6, 2017","Doctor Strange elevates yet another relatively unknown Marvel character to top tier status, making it well worth a dizzying watch in 3D."
doctor-strange,Courtney Howard,False,"Nov 4, 2017","While sufficiently hitting all the correct targets, the most refreshing addition is how it melds mind-bending, show-stopping, kaleidoscopic visuals with its narrative stakes."
doctor-strange,Rachit Gupta,False,"Oct 28, 2017",Dr Strange provides an enriching and exhilarating experience.
doctor-strange,Matthew Bond,True,"Oct 18, 2017","It's handicapped by performances that are decent but not great, an over-abundance of visual effects that are state-of-the-art but far too familiar, and a storyline that just gets sillier the longer it goes on."
doctor-strange,Sarah Marrs,False,"Oct 10, 2017",So you just have to take the good with the bad. What works in Doctor Strange works REALLY WELL.
doctor-strange,Keeva Stratton,False,"Sep 15, 2017","[Tilda] Swinton, I would argue, is the most underrated actor of this generation, and she deserves to be held in the highest of esteem."
doctor-strange,Diane Carson,False,"Aug 29, 2017","When Dr. Strange folds and warps time, energy and space, it becomes a visual feast reminiscent of Inception, but it also visualizes his journey."
doctor-strange,Megan Burbank,False,"Aug 22, 2017","Doctor Strange might have a lot of baggage, but more than anything else, it's fun."
doctor-strange,Emily Yoshida,True,"Jun 13, 2017",The film is bloated and unfunny... and is plagued by a boringly retrograde notion of pan-Asian-ness while conveniently escaping the burden of casting any actual Asians in its principal roles.
doctor-strange,Allyson Gronowitz,False,"Jun 2, 2017","Indeed, Doctor Strange's climactic redemption is as spellbinding as it is satisfying. But of course, we know the magic is just getting started."
doctor-strange,Rain Jokinen,False,"Mar 23, 2017","When Doctor Strange works, it's for the same reasons most of the Marvel movies do: They aren't afraid of humor, and they know what's funny."
doctor-strange,James Whitbrook,True,"Mar 23, 2017","Strange is pretty much the same sort of movie we've seen from Marvel Studios ever since Robert Downey Jr. snarked his way through the first Iron Man and into our hearts all those years ago, and the same style of origin Marvel has been delivering since."
doctor-strange,Sean Axmaker,False,"Mar 10, 2017","Doctor Strange has all the strengths of a Marvel movie-a well-told story, a well-tuned sense of humor about itself, a personal drama to shape the hero's journey-as well as all the weaknesses (conventions of a superhero origin tale are getting repetitive)."
doctor-strange,Pete Vonder Haar,False,"Feb 17, 2017","The effects are the closest most of us will get to tripping balls in a Disney movie outside of dropping acid and watching ""Pink Elephants on Parade"" on a YouTube loop."
doctor-strange,Kaori Shoji,False,"Jan 18, 2017","OK, so Dr. Strange is not as soulful as expected. But in this particular reality, I'll take what I can get."
doctor-strange,Nathaniel Rogers,False,"Jan 2, 2017",Doctor Strange's last act is so trippy and exciting that you can almost forgive that generic story.
doctor-strange,Matt Cohen,False,"Jan 2, 2017","Though Doctor Strange's impressive visual effects and head-spinning mythology might seem a bit much for Marvel's typical filmgoing crowd, its story is rudimentary enough to keep the more far-reaching elements relatively grounded."
doctor-strange,Richard von Busack,False,"Dec 31, 2016",The movie is very much Harry Potter for adults.
doctor-strange,Rashid Irani,True,"Dec 31, 2016",[An] underwhelming panel-to-screen Marvel adaptation.

doctor-strange,Barry Hertz,True,"Dec 31, 2016","Doctor Strange, intended to be a mind-bending, rule-breaking rebuke to the squares of superhero cinema, turns out to be a rebel in name only -- the textbook definition of a bad trip."
doctor-strange,Stephanie Zacharek,False,"Dec 31, 2016","Cumberbatch, both a natural comedian and a subtle one, knows how to get a big laugh from nothing more than an arched eyebrow."
doctor-strange,Jessica Lachenal,False,"Dec 31, 2016",The overall experience of Doctor Strange is wonderfully fun... provided you don't try to dig a little deeper.
doctor-strange,Brad Keefe,False,"Dec 30, 2016","Doctor Strange is another win for Marvel, and proof that there are some new tricks to be found in superhero movies after all."

doctor-strange,Craig Mathieson,False,"Dec 27, 2016","For all the talk of alternate dimensions and sightings of a bald Tilda Swinton, Scott Derrickson's film is a sturdy addition to the superhero saga that's been slotting in compatible pieces since Iron Man delivered its first wisecrack in 2008."
doctor-strange,Daniel Krauze,False,"Dec 22, 2016",Dr. Strange is not only entertaining and absurd. It's also an intelligent film. [Full review in Spanish]
doctor-strange,David Nusair,True,"Dec 22, 2016",Quite possibly the worst of the Marvel movies...
doctor-strange,Camilla Long,False,"Dec 17, 2016","Strip away the thick rind of make-up and the comedy Hugh Laurie accent, and Strange is exactly like every role Cumberbatch has ever played."
doctor-strange,Tim Brayton,False,"Dec 17, 2016",It's not a tremendously rewarding piece of storytelling... But it's dang cool.
doctor-strange,Leonard Maltin,True,"Dec 15, 2016","My reaction to this movie is mixed, at best."
doctor-strange,Kevin A. Ranson,False,"Dec 6, 2016","Strange can do great things by the end of the movie, but he still has a lot to learn before he can take on the title of Sorcerer Supreme - and that should be fun to watch, too."

doctor-strange,Julia Smith,False,"Dec 5, 2016","Dr Strange isn't just any old superhero, he's not gaudy and violent, he's smarter, he's gentler. He's basically a much nicer Sherlock... in a cape."
doctor-strange,Sarah Ward,False,"Dec 3, 2016","Doctor Strange shines not just courtesy of its left-of-centre, franchise-eschewing tendencies, but thanks to lively, engaging and empathetic portrayals."
doctor-strange,James Kendrick,False,"Dec 3, 2016","keeps enough of what audiences clearly crave while also throwing in a few twists that make it feel, if not entirely unique, at least different."
doctor-strange,John Serba,False,"Nov 29, 2016","Pops with the type of psychedelic, kaleidoscopic weirdness that'll have you wondering who dosed your popcorn with psilocybin... although it never fulfills the potential of its main character."

doctor-strange,Diego Batlle,False,"Nov 24, 2016","A film that takes certain aspects from multiple recognizable sources, but adds visual, narrative and dramatic elements that differentiate it from other recent movies of the genre. [Full review in Spanish]"
doctor-strange,David Keyes,False,"Nov 24, 2016","A film far more rich, entertaining and intellectual than the promotional trail of glitzy images and ambitious visual effects would have you believe."

doctor-strange,Wesley Lovell,False,"Nov 22, 2016",More of the same is not necessarily always a bad thing. It's just unfortunate that it can't be something new or structurally different.
doctor-strange,Stuart Klawans,False,"Nov 22, 2016","Cumberbatch is exceptionally good at playing brilliant, arrogant, isolated characters -- look at his Sherlock Holmes and Alan Turing -- and so is right at home as Strange."

doctor-strange,John Urbancich,False,"Nov 19, 2016","Just when everyone felt comic-book movies have reached critical mass comes, perhaps, the year's finest tentpole movie."
doctor-strange,Charles Koplinski,False,"Nov 18, 2016",A worthy addition to the Marvel canon.

doctor-strange,Jason Best,False,"Nov 12, 2016",It's Cumberbatch who makes the movie zing. He's sardonic. He's funny. He's buff enough for the martial arts. And he fits into the movie's comic-book world surprisingly well.
doctor-strange,Emmanuel Báez,False,"Nov 11, 2016","Marvel's most amazing and dazzling film, with enough moments that will remain for posterity. [Full review in Spanish]"

doctor-strange,Jim Lane,False,"Nov 10, 2016","Much of it takes place in the ""Mirror Dimension,"" an eye-popping universe that M.C. Escher might have imagined if he'd worked with CGI. That, plus a strong story and stronger cast makes this a winner."
doctor-strange,Robert Roten,False,"Nov 10, 2016","Marvel Studio's latest superhero origin story is as polished and as flashy as we have come to expect from this highly successful enterprise. It is a visual feast, especially in 3D."

doctor-strange,Steve Persall,False,"Nov 10, 2016","Not since Iron Man has a superhero movie surprised and delighted like Doctor Strange, after eight years of Marvel glut and DC rebuttals in-between."

doctor-strange,Mike McGranaghan,False,"Nov 8, 2016","Great fun! Doctor Strange has everything you'd want or expect from a Marvel adventure, but it also feels fresh and new."
doctor-strange,Sean Burns,True,"Nov 8, 2016",A beat-for-beat remake of the first Iron Man movie crossed with a Windows 95 screensaver. Doesn't this stuff ever get stale to you people?
doctor-strange,Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat,False,"Nov 7, 2016",A Marvel character fights evil in a mix of special effects and metaphysics.
doctor-strange,Eric Melin,False,"Nov 7, 2016",...a surplus of thrilling escapism inside a movie that clocks in at just less than two hours. You wonder why it took the Harry Potter films eight films to get where they were going.
doctor-strange,Dominic Barlow,False,"Nov 7, 2016",It's a traditional fantasy journey powered in its own right by a sense of the unknowable and a star turn from Benedict Cumberbatch.
doctor-strange,Marija Djurovic,False,"Nov 7, 2016",It's a refreshingly weird and a fun addition to the MCU.
doctor-strange,J. Olson,True,"Nov 7, 2016","""Doctor Strange"" is where the welcome wears out, where Marvel's shortcomings take center stage and play a thousand encores."

doctor-strange,Matthew Toomey,False,"Nov 6, 2016","Providing a finale that doesn't rely on explosions and drawn-out punch ups, Doctor Strange earns points for being a little different."
doctor-strange,James Verniere,True,"Nov 5, 2016","Dull, talky, derivative, full of the usual CGI cheez whiz. Cumberbatch is the epitome of vanilla."

doctor-strange,Ilan Preskovsky,False,"Nov 4, 2016","Though I saw it in 3D, I fully intend to see it again in IMAX -- I can't imagine a film this year better suited to that format."
doctor-strange,Theresa Smith,False,"Nov 4, 2016","It is an entertaining action movie that features a confident lead who takes the role seriously, so you take the story about magic seriously."
doctor-strange,Jonathan Romney,False,"Nov 4, 2016",Doctor Strange seems to represent the point at which the art of CGI and the discipline of imagining visual images spatially seems to have reached a sublime degree of 3D complexity.
doctor-strange,Aakash Karkare,True,"Nov 4, 2016",The filmmaking isn't bold enough to fully revel in the strangeness of the source material.
doctor-strange,Roger Tennis,False,"Nov 4, 2016",It doesn't take a Sherlock to see that 'Doctor Strange' successfully sends the Marvel Universe spinning in a mystical new direction.
doctor-strange,Jeff Simon,False,"Nov 4, 2016","Doctor Strange is the coolest comic book movie of the year. Truth to tell, it's one of the coolest I've ever seen."
doctor-strange,Rubin Safaya,True,"Nov 4, 2016","Affluent white guy gets knocked down a peg or two, gets rebuked by his girlfriend (Rachel McAdams) when he needs her support the most, has an epiphany at the hands of an (inexplicably white) eastern master, and re-emerges as a superhero: Doctor Peculiar."
doctor-strange,Andrea Chase,False,"Nov 4, 2016","From a whiz-bang opening sequence where space folds in on itself as combatants hurl magical fire at on another, to the charismatic, ahem, marvel that is Benedict Cumberbatch in the title role, this action film is a knockout."

doctor-strange,Jesse Hassenger,True,"Nov 4, 2016","Basically Iron Man with weaker laugh lines and vastly cooler action sequences. It's Iron Man meets Thor 2, and the thing is, those guys have met before."
doctor-strange,Christopher Lawrence,False,"Nov 4, 2016","Even as it closely adheres to the Marvel origin story template, it's the studio's most out-there release yet -- and that's saying something after Guardians of the Galaxy."
doctor-strange,Tony Medley,False,"Nov 4, 2016","...the best 3-D I have ever seen...so good that I actually got dizzy . It's the special effects and 3-D that make this entertaining, certainly not the fantasy or the hackneyed story or anything else."

doctor-strange,Tom Meek,False,"Nov 4, 2016","It's not as fresh and sassy as Guardians of the Galaxy, but it is a piquant changeup for fans who have come to find the Avengers series getting long in the tooth."
doctor-strange,Kirk Baird,False,"Nov 4, 2016","A mind-bending, exciting, funny, and, yes, strange adventure, that ranks among Marvel's best, and as a superhero introduction film is second to only 2008's Iron Man."

doctor-strange,Chris Sawin,False,"Nov 4, 2016","Visually, this is a hallucinatory wet dream. However, like the character in the film, Doctor Strange offers a spellbinding exploration of what lies beyond the stars yet lacks the proper mastery of the mystical concepts it introduces."

doctor-strange,Rohan Naahar,False,"Nov 4, 2016","If only the same care that has gone into its visuals were put in the rest of it, Doctor Strange could've been a trippy, psychedelic adventure, and not a middling entry in a 14-film-old franchise."
doctor-strange,Avi Offer,False,"Nov 3, 2016","Well-cast with dazzling visuals and production design, but somewhat dull, and it lacks enough surprises and wit to escape its mediocrity. It's lucky to have Benedict Cumberbatch who rises above the material with his charisma."

doctor-strange,Peter Travers,False,"Nov 3, 2016","See it in 3-D IMAX, people, and you're in for the hallucinatory headtrip of the year. And having Cumberbatch around really raises the bar on what's possible in comic-book fantasy."

doctor-strange,David Edelstein,False,"Nov 3, 2016","Doctor Strange has a dazzling, kaleidoscopic palette that compensates for the usual thin-ish story featuring A-list actors zapping one another, along with a hero who looks fearsomely witty even in repose."
doctor-strange,Joelle Smith,False,"Nov 3, 2016","For a film that has promised diversity and wanting to move from harmful Asian stereotypes, this movie fails to bring in people of color in a meaningful way."

doctor-strange,Scott Tobias,False,"Nov 3, 2016","Even with the fate of the entire universe at stake, Derrickson keeps the tone appealingly light and jokey, and Cumberbatch's Strange isn't so cynical that he can't thrill at discovering his spectacular capabilities ..."
doctor-strange,Brian Orndorf,False,"Nov 3, 2016","It's a mostly successful and visually dazzling introduction for the wizard, who fits in comfortably with the ongoing brand name world-building, making him a welcomingly oddball avenger."
doctor-strange,Mark Dujsik,False,"Nov 3, 2016",There are some genuinely stupendous action sequences here.
doctor-strange,Helen Lewis,False,"Nov 3, 2016",Is this film enjoyable? Yes. Is it the kind of film you can fall in love with? No.
doctor-strange,J. R. Jones,False,"Nov 3, 2016","McAdams costars as Strange's fellow surgeon and former lover, and her lively scenes with Cumberbatch are worth all the digital effects and then some."
doctor-strange,Ali Gray,False,"Nov 3, 2016",The worst thing you can say about Doctor Strange is that it doesn't aim high enough.
doctor-strange,Stephen Rebello,False,"Nov 3, 2016",Doctor Strange is Marvel's most visually splendiferous movie yet.
doctor-strange,Marc Savlov,False,"Nov 3, 2016","Defiantly not your everyday Avengers movie, Doctor Strange instead inhabits the same franchise universe with an outré panache."
doctor-strange,Justin Chang,False,"Nov 3, 2016",Playful and distinctive enough to throw a wrench into the grinding gears of the Marvel assembly line.
doctor-strange,Matthew Lickona,False,"Nov 3, 2016","As a Christian allegory, director Scott Derrickson's entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe is impressively thorough...As a movie, it's silly, sloppy, and spectacular."
doctor-strange,James Berardinelli,False,"Nov 3, 2016",Doctor Strange tells a standard tale with just enough cleverness to keep the viewer interested.
doctor-strange,Tom Russo,False,"Nov 3, 2016","The mystical settings that this ""sorcerer supreme"" navigates make for exhilarating sensory overload, powerfully expanding on classic visuals from pioneering Marvel artist Steve Ditko. The upshot: The movie develops a distinctively trippy identity."
doctor-strange,Jon Niccum,False,"Nov 3, 2016",Cumberbatch grounds the material even while levitating.
doctor-strange,Frank Swietek,True,"Nov 3, 2016","Not strange enough; it has plenty of CGI magic effects, but lacks the cinematic magic that would set it apart from the other franchises in Marvel's increasingly crowded stable."
doctor-strange,Michael O'Sullivan,False,"Nov 3, 2016","All in all, ""Doctor Strange"" is a fun and trippy excursion to a place where Marvel rarely seems to go: that is, to the retinal roots of the comics."
doctor-strange,Chris Hewitt,False,"Nov 3, 2016","It is, indeed, strange - and that's a good thing."
doctor-strange,Victoria Alexander,False,"Nov 3, 2016",Doctor Strange rules the Marvel Universe. A fully realized character with dimensions. Bravo to the thousands who created the astonishing visuals.
doctor-strange,Sara Stewart,False,"Nov 3, 2016","With a mischievous, metaphysical flourish, ""Doctor Strange"" administers some much-needed CPR to the flagging superhero genre."
doctor-strange,Soren Andersen,False,"Nov 3, 2016","In the matter of ""Dr. Strange,"" two words: Big. Fun."
doctor-strange,Bob Bloom,False,"Nov 3, 2016","'Doctor Strange' is another winning entry for Marvel. It will not disappoint fans, and those not familiar with the comic book or the character also will find the movie vastly entertaining."
doctor-strange,Calvin Wilson,False,"Nov 3, 2016",This is as good as popcorn entertainment gets.
doctor-strange,Matt Goldberg,True,"Nov 3, 2016","Doctor Strange likes to think it's adding a new dimension to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but in truth it's the same Marvel story from a slightly different perspective."
doctor-strange,Jason Zingale,False,"Nov 3, 2016","Doctor Strange never strays too far from the tried-and-true Marvel formula, but it's not afraid to get a little weird either."
doctor-strange,Jeff Beck,True,"Nov 3, 2016","No doubt there will be many who enjoy Doctor Strange simply because there's a plethora of action, but for those looking for the satisfying narrative foundation that these films are usually set upon, unfortunately you'll find it just a little lacking."
doctor-strange,Tirdad Derakhshani,False,"Nov 3, 2016","While I'm tired of the wretched tyranny of comic book flicks, I admit I liked Cumberbatch's picture. For the most part."
doctor-strange,Neil Pond,False,"Nov 3, 2016","Eyeball-popping, jaw-dropping, kaleidoscopic, head-tripping---a rollicking adventure with crisp wit, strong characters and visually impressive razzle-dazzle."
doctor-strange,Manohla Dargis,False,"Nov 3, 2016","So visually transfixing, so beautiful and nimble that you may even briefly forget the brand."
doctor-strange,Peter Howell,False,"Nov 3, 2016",Cumberbatch wears that Strange cape well.

doctor-strange,Blake Howard,False,"Nov 2, 2016","""Doctor Strange"" is fine, but it's as transient and unmemorable as a dream."
doctor-strange,Cameron Williams,False,"Nov 2, 2016",Shows Marvel have mastered the art of the C+ despite getting wonderfully weird at times.
doctor-strange,Eric D. Snider,False,"Nov 2, 2016",The first time in a while that a Marvel Cinematic Universe(TM) movie has offered anything new to look at or think about.
doctor-strange,Britton Peele,False,"Nov 2, 2016",Marvel is getting increasingly good at delivering great movies based on material that shouldn't really work on film.
doctor-strange,Mick LaSalle,False,"Nov 2, 2016","At least the movie takes awhile before it goes into full tilt action, and even when it does, it never completely loses itself or its central character."
doctor-strange,Rex Reed,True,"Nov 2, 2016","None of it makes any sense, but logic is the last thing any of the minds attracted to this kind of junk want or expect."
doctor-strange,Greg Maki,False,"Nov 2, 2016","""Doctor Strange"" looks and feels almost nothing like the previous 13 films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe or any other comic book movie."
doctor-strange,Sandy Cohen,False,"Nov 2, 2016","No affinity for superheroes or familiarity with Marvel mythology is required to enjoy the visual spectacle that is Doctor Strange. Being open to mysticism and the possibility of parallel dimensions might help, though."
doctor-strange,Gavia Baker-Whitelaw,True,"Nov 2, 2016","Those reality-warping effects offer a tantalizing glimpse at how superhero movies could embrace the visual wealth of comics. If only its story, a retread of Iron Man, was as creative as the action scenes."
doctor-strange,Katie Walsh,False,"Nov 2, 2016","Watching ""Doctor Strange"" is a bit like ordering pad thai at Applebee's: It's different than the usual, but still kind of bland."
doctor-strange,Amy Nicholson,False,"Nov 2, 2016","Defiantly old-school -- not the cozy, apple-scented nostalgia of the first Captain America film, but that cold, back-of-the-library whiff of eraser nubs and mold."
doctor-strange,Robin Clifford,False,"Nov 2, 2016","For a non-fan just reviewing a movie, it is, as I said, noisy and entertaining."
doctor-strange,Laura Clifford,False,"Nov 2, 2016","although ""Doctor Strange"" is often a 'been here, done that' experience, this origin story is still worthwhile because of the high pedigree of its casting and special effects."
doctor-strange,Meredith Borders,False,"Nov 2, 2016",The multi-dimensional magic of DOCTOR STRANGE's universe changes all the rules for superhero movies. It breaks from formula and leaves room for innovation and play.
doctor-strange,Matt Patches,True,"Nov 2, 2016","Like Strange's ""mirror-verse,"" where sorcerers cast spells...without impacting our physical realm, his comic-book vehicle delivers bursts of wonder with little lasting effect."
doctor-strange,A.A. Dowd,False,"Nov 2, 2016","The 14th installment in the ever-expanding MCU is the first to really exploit the possibilities of CGI -- to use state-of-the-art technology to its full, jaw-dropping advantage."
doctor-strange,Jacob Brogan,False,"Nov 2, 2016","Thanks in part to its charming cast, and despite its serious intentions, Doctor Strange is a pleasantly silly film, with plenty of humor hiding amid all the reality-distorting special effects and high-flying action."
doctor-strange,Michael Sangiacomo,False,"Nov 2, 2016","This film set the bar very high for superhero movies, something Marvel does with seeming ease."
doctor-strange,Rafer Guzman,False,"Nov 2, 2016","Director Scott Derrickson and his co-writer, C. Robert Cargill, keep Doctor Strange balanced, just barely, between trippy psychedelia and plain incoherence."
doctor-strange,Bill Goodykoontz,False,"Nov 2, 2016","Derrickson's use of computer-generated action is a strength instead of a strain, and it's not just showing off; in the context of the film, the bizarre images make sense."
doctor-strange,Lawrence Toppman,False,"Nov 2, 2016",You know you're in a top-drawer Marvel Comics adaptation when even the Stan Lee cameo is clever.
doctor-strange,Steven D. Greydanus,False,"Nov 2, 2016",Perhaps we might say simply that Derrickson has made a bona fide movie at a time when Marvel is only doing installments.
doctor-strange,Vicky Roach,False,"Nov 2, 2016","Once Doctor Strange is paired with his scene-stealing magic cape, Cumberbatch's character literally and figuratively takes flight."
doctor-strange,David 'Mad Dog' Bradley,False,"Nov 2, 2016","With one of Marvel's most indie-scene, idiosyncratic casts and co-writer/director Scott Derrickson managing to keep the wilder, trippier aspects of the plot under control (mostly), this is certainly more fun than another Iron Man adventure"
doctor-strange,Mara Reinstein,True,"Nov 2, 2016","Nobody is having much fun here. Well, except for Doctor Strange's devilish Cloak of Levitation."
doctor-strange,Angelica Jade Bastién,True,"Nov 2, 2016","For all of its wondrous world-building and trippy effects, Doctor Strange isn't the evolutionary step forward for Marvel that it needs to be storytelling-wise."
doctor-strange,Peter Canavese,False,"Nov 2, 2016","Doctor Strange looks at urban architecture through a twisting digital kaleidoscope, next-stepping from Inception to an M.C. Escher-esque action aesthetic that amounts to three-dimensional chess."
doctor-strange,Jake Cole,False,"Nov 2, 2016",Nothing that Marvel Studios has produced can compare to the visual splendor of Scott Derrickson's Doctor Strange.
doctor-strange,Matt Prigge,False,"Nov 2, 2016","When ""Doctor Strange"" is cooking, which is mostly in its fairly breathless second half, it keeps throwing clever and goofy set piece ideas at you."
doctor-strange,Travis Hopson,False,"Nov 2, 2016",Mashes up the metaphysical elements of Inception and The Matrix with a bit of superhero hocus-pocus.
doctor-strange,Fred Topel,False,"Nov 1, 2016",Franchise Fred approves.
doctor-strange,Aine O'Connor,False,"Nov 1, 2016","Like a cross between later Harry Potter and 2001: A Space Odyssey, it might baffle younger children, but works very well on most levels."
doctor-strange,Paul Whitington,False,"Nov 1, 2016","It's a lot of fun, and commendably mind-bending."
doctor-strange,Dann Gire,False,"Nov 1, 2016","Humorously quirky and visually spellbinding, Doctor Strange ranks as one of the best executed Marvel Comics movies, up there with Iron Man, Spider-Man 2 and The Avengers."
doctor-strange,Wenlei Ma,False,"Nov 1, 2016","Doctor Strange once again proves that when it comes to superhero movies, Marvel has its finger firmly on the pulse."
doctor-strange,Michael Phillips,False,"Nov 1, 2016","Doctor Strange really does show you a few new things, or at least familiar things in a clever new way."
doctor-strange,Norman Wilner,False,"Nov 1, 2016",Doctor Strange fulfills the requirements of a Marvel origin story while feeling wonderfully unencumbered by any of the franchise maintenance that handicapped Avengers: Age Of Ultron and Ant-Man.
doctor-strange,Tom Gliatto,False,"Nov 1, 2016","Any other actor in a high-collared burgundy cape and goatee would risk looking like a lounge magician. But Benedict Cumberbatch is so unmannered, so smart, so playful, he makes the title character...one of the best Marvel movie superheroes yet."
doctor-strange,Rick Bentley,False,"Nov 1, 2016","Even when the movie gets massively visual, it never gets away from the central strength of Cumberbatch's performance. That's not easy to do, but accomplishing the task is why Doctor Strange is pure Marvel magic."
doctor-strange,Aramide Tinubu,False,"Nov 1, 2016","The film is a strangely bizarre and brilliant departure from what we usually see from Marvel, and that's why I adored it."
doctor-strange,Joanna Langfield,False,"Nov 1, 2016","While very much an origins flick, this ambitious kickoff is also, happily, a movie that wows while it makes us wonder."
doctor-strange,Joshua Rivera,True,"Nov 1, 2016","Ultimately, Doctor Strange isn't so much bad as it is difficult to justify."
doctor-strange,Shelbie Lynn Bostedt,False,"Nov 1, 2016","It is visually stunning and makes excellent use of 3D, which feels less like a gimmick and more like a vital part of experiencing the film as it's supposed to be."
doctor-strange,Allison Shoemaker,False,"Nov 1, 2016",Doctor Strange perfectly balances its commitment to the bizarre comic book stories from which it springs with the familiar tropes of the origin story.
doctor-strange,David Sexton,False,"Oct 31, 2016","This is by far the trippiest, most psychedelic Marvel film yet."
doctor-strange,Josh Larsen,False,"Oct 31, 2016","...entertains, but never haunts."
doctor-strange,Ernesto Diezmartinez,False,"Oct 31, 2016",A film of the medical version of Tony Stark that was more enjoyable than I expected. [Full review in Spanish]
doctor-strange,Rebecca Pahle,False,"Oct 31, 2016",Stunning visuals go a long way towards enlivening this largely unexceptional superhero origin story.
doctor-strange,Jordan Raup,True,"Oct 31, 2016",The strangest thing about [Marvel's] latest feature is that all of these characters come across utterly bored with their vocations.
doctor-strange,Kim Newman,False,"Oct 31, 2016","Whenever the action threatens to get samey or the spectacle verges on the monotonous, the film can rely on Cumberbatch's sense of fun to tide it over."
doctor-strange,Tim Martain,False,"Oct 30, 2016","Doctor Strange gets in, tells its story, thrills you, makes you laugh, and then gets out before you get a chance to get sick of it. No stretching, no padding, no wasted space."
doctor-strange,Ed Whitfield,True,"Oct 30, 2016","The film feels more programmed than written, more pre-visualised than directed."
doctor-strange,Wendy Ide,False,"Oct 30, 2016",Cumberbatch makes the least immediately likable of the Marvel heroes into the most unpredictable and intriguing.
doctor-strange,Mark Jackson,False,"Oct 28, 2016",'Dr. Strange' is the first Marvel movie to tell the reality-based version of where superpowers come from. Science takes human supernormal abilities seriously now-exciting stuff.
doctor-strange,Javier Ocaña,False,"Oct 28, 2016",An unconventional film with a good soundtrack and lots of digital effects filled with madness. [Full review in Spanish]
doctor-strange,Paul Verhoeven,False,"Oct 28, 2016","The VFX are the best I've seen in any Marvel movie, ever. If you do see Doctor Strange -- and you really ought to -- I recommend seeing it at IMAX."
doctor-strange,Nicholas Barber,False,"Oct 28, 2016","Despite focusing on one of the company's less famous and more bizarre characters, it is all too familiar for a film with 'Strange' in the title. Still, none of that stops it being thoroughly enjoyable."
doctor-strange,Russell Baillie,False,"Oct 28, 2016","This doctor, it seems, has a cure for superhero fatigue."
doctor-strange,Kanin Srimaneekulroj,False,"Oct 28, 2016","The film's otherworldly quality and excellent comedic moments brings to mind Guardians Of The Galaxy in terms of its inventiveness, bringing us a fresher, stranger (I'm sorry. It's right there!) version of the Marvel films we know and love."
doctor-strange,Stephen Romei,False,"Oct 28, 2016","Doctor Strange, the 14th film in the franchise based on Marvel comic books, is one of the funniest of recent times, lifted beyond the ordinary world, as befits the story, by a superb cast that includes Benedict Cumberbatch in the title role."
doctor-strange,Ed Power,False,"Oct 28, 2016","Cumberbatch is magnetic as egotistical neurosurgeon Stephen Strange, who, seeking to reverse the disastrous effects of a car accident, is plunged into a trippy Neverland of parallel dimensions and cosmic conflict."
doctor-strange,Rich Cline,False,"Oct 28, 2016","Yes, Doctor Strange will change the tone of Marvel movies going forward, and that's a very good thing."
doctor-strange,Saskia Baron,False,"Oct 28, 2016","Doctor Strange could descend into a clutch of clichés, but director/writer Scott Derrickson has injected plenty of wit. The visuals, especially in the modern-world sequences, are stunning."
doctor-strange,Michael Arbeiter,False,"Oct 28, 2016","Spectacle is as important a character to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as its caped crusaders, and never before has this proved such a significant truth."
doctor-strange,Bryan Bishop,True,"Oct 28, 2016","Perhaps it's just that there's a little too much Marvel Studios in Doctor Strange, when the strongest thing about the film are the filmmakers hired to bring it to life."
doctor-strange,Sergio López Aguirre,False,"Oct 28, 2016",We are facing a visually unique film that will fuse Marvel's mystical and galactic sides together. [Full review in Spanish]
doctor-strange,Jorge (JJ) Negrete,True,"Oct 28, 2016","Not even a sorcerer as powerful as Dr. Strange is able to break Marvel's spell, which continues with the same kind of villains and weak female counterparts. [Full review in Spanish]"
doctor-strange,Alan Scherstuhl,False,"Oct 28, 2016","It's not all that strange, but it's restlessly arresting and always technically impressive. Unlike most studio franchise fantasies, Doctor Strange rewards the eye rather than assaults it."
doctor-strange,Kristy Puchko,True,"Oct 28, 2016","MCU has been raising the bar on what audiences should demand from superhero spectacle. But sometimes, even they can't clear it."
doctor-strange,Jamie East,False,"Oct 28, 2016","If Iron Man was Marvel's infancy and Guardians Of The Galaxy the awkward teenage years, Doctor Strange, teamed with Deadpool and Civil War, shows a company growing into adulthood with its audience. The result is an absolute joy."
doctor-strange,Luke Buckmaster,True,"Oct 27, 2016",The screenwriters gorge on pseudo philosophical pep talk as if it were white powder at an LA pool party.
doctor-strange,Tom Glasson,False,"Oct 27, 2016","Visually, this is Inception dialled up to eleven, a world-bending, shape-shifting and time-distorting Escher painting filled with heroes and villains duelling over the possibility of immortality."
doctor-strange,Amy West,False,"Oct 27, 2016",Surprisingly funny and arguably [Marvel's] most audacious film to date.
doctor-strange,Alex Doenau,False,"Oct 27, 2016","With a charismatic lead and almost infinite potential for future set pieces, it's nice to think that we could have another blockbusting dynamo on our hands."
doctor-strange,Andy Psyllides,False,"Oct 27, 2016","Yes the overarching plot is a familiar one and some of the A-list supporting players get precious little to chew on (Mads Mikkelsen is particularly short-changed as the Darth Vader-like Kaecilius), but Doc Strange does the job and then some."
doctor-strange,Tufayel Ahmed,False,"Oct 27, 2016",Like previous expository Marvel films much of Doctor Strange is devoted to Cumberbatch acquainting himself with his new powers. But the film's visual mindbending is what sets it apart from the studio's past releases.
doctor-strange,Alistair Harkness,False,"Oct 27, 2016",Mostly ... this is a weird and witty breath of fresh air- and as a bonus it also finds a neat solution to the excessive third-act destruction of The Avengers/Captain America films without stinting on spectacle.
doctor-strange,Alan Jones,False,"Oct 27, 2016",Forget all you know or think you know about the Marvel Cinematic Universe. ... Derrickson has blown the glitter dust off one of its second-string superheroes and provided him with a barnstorming origin story ...
doctor-strange,Brian Viner,False,"Oct 27, 2016",Doctor Strange is mostly a blast.
doctor-strange,Allan Hunter,False,"Oct 27, 2016",Doctor Strange does have the good sense not to take itself too seriously and there is a welcome sense of humour running through it with a string of witty asides from Cumberbatch.
doctor-strange,Steve Newall,False,"Oct 27, 2016",Doctor Strange boasts the most mind-bending visual effects I've ever seen...
doctor-strange,Alison Willmore,False,"Oct 27, 2016","It's imperfect, but it's enjoyable, and it sure looks good."
doctor-strange,Mark Hughes,False,"Oct 27, 2016","[A] masterpiece of comic book cinema... part Iron Man, part The Matrix, part The Conjuring, and part Harry Potter [with] a dash of Inception, a pinch of Nightmare on Elm Street, [and] a hint of Hero..."
doctor-strange,Geoffrey Macnab,False,"Oct 27, 2016",The actors are skilled enough to make us intensely curious about their back stories and for us to accept some of their more preposterous lines of dialogue.
doctor-strange,Matt Donato,False,"Oct 27, 2016","Doctor Strange is all about the razzle-dazzle, where spectacle elements are good enough to save a more clunky, weightless Marvel origin story."
doctor-strange,Jacob Oller,False,"Oct 27, 2016",Don't let the goatee fool you - this is no Iron Man.
doctor-strange,Julian Roman,False,"Oct 27, 2016",Doctor Strange will obliterate your expectations. It is an enormously entertaining film; a rousing cinematic adventure loaded with stunning visual effects.
doctor-strange,Nigel Andrews,False,"Oct 27, 2016","With mystical exposition and cod philosophising growing by the minute, our senses are gratefully rescued by flashy fits of special effects."
doctor-strange,MaryAnn Johanson,True,"Oct 27, 2016",Busy with CGI to hide the emptiness where the emotional core should be. Even the mechanics of getting a man from mere mortal to demigod-in-a-cape are rote.
doctor-strange,Matt Neal,False,"Oct 26, 2016","Marvel Studios is becoming increasingly like Evel Knievel - with every successful stunt it lands, it makes the next one bigger and more difficult."
doctor-strange,Simon Miraudo,False,"Oct 26, 2016","With viewer (and creative) fatigue setting in, to whom can Marvel Studios turn to for re-invigoration? A cocky doctor with mystical, mind-expanding powers and even more mystical facial hair? Sure, that'll kill two hours."
doctor-strange,Leigh Paatsch,False,"Oct 26, 2016",It is not often creative ambition and actual execution rise together to such atmospheric heights.
doctor-strange,John Lui,False,"Oct 26, 2016",It becomes clear why Cumberbatch was sought for the part. He is perhaps the most gifted of the Marvel recruits... His only equal in acting facility is Iron Man's Robert Downey Jr.
doctor-strange,Patrick Kolan,False,"Oct 26, 2016","However, it achieves a flavor of its own; it feels like its own unique superheroic proposition, and that's impressive in its own right. Frankly, I'd take this spiffy red cape over Clark Kent's any day of the week."
doctor-strange,Erin Free,False,"Oct 26, 2016","Itâ(TM)s exciting, entertaining, goofy, and fun..."
doctor-strange,Louise Keller,False,"Oct 26, 2016","Mind-bending effects, jaw-gaping action sequences and a cast with pedigree enable Marvel's Doctor Strange to soar through its many dimensions & parallel universes to a cinematic 3D Shangri-la."
doctor-strange,James Mottram,False,"Oct 25, 2016","The engrossing 3D visuals are superbly conceived, like Inception times 1,000, as buildings start to fold in on themselves, kaleidoscope-style."
doctor-strange,Martin Roberts,False,"Oct 25, 2016","The film is in some ways a triumph, but as a whole lacks the cohesion and charm of some of Marvel's other comic book adaptations."
doctor-strange,Tara Brady,False,"Oct 25, 2016",Nimble dialogue and a constellation of capable - if mostly whitewashed - stars ensure this is a rather livelier creation than this year's Captain America: Civil War.
doctor-strange,Laura Delaney,False,"Oct 25, 2016",Doctor Strange isn't as Marvel-ous as fans would like but it sets up nicely for a promising sequel.
doctor-strange,Kevin Harley,False,"Oct 25, 2016","Weaponised by dynamic scripting, the A-class cast sell the concoction well."
doctor-strange,Ben Nicholson,False,"Oct 25, 2016","Grounds its outrageousness with an undercurrent of knowing sarcasm, much like its winning star."
doctor-strange,Manuela Lazic,False,"Oct 25, 2016","At long last - a light, funny superhero movie that embraces the fantasy aspects of the genre in both its story and form."
doctor-strange,Matthew Turner,False,"Oct 25, 2016","Like Inception mashed with M.C. Escher: the richly imaginative visual design is endlessly entertaining in its depiction of astral planes, mirror dimensions and multiverses."

doctor-strange,Poppy-Jay Palmer,False,"Oct 24, 2016",Two hours of Strange being confused at the ins and outs of the Astral Plane would have been just as satisfying as the actual film. This is the new VFX bar to reach.
doctor-strange,James Dyer,False,"Oct 24, 2016","A bizarre and beautiful detour on the Marvel journey, which culminates in a mind-bending, expectation-inverting final act."
doctor-strange,Stefan Kyriazis,False,"Oct 24, 2016",The smart script and trio of clever British thespians do their best to puncture any pomposity and there are some nice throw away lines about funny teas and wifi passwords. And yet...
doctor-strange,Tim Robey,False,"Oct 24, 2016","Thankfully, amid all the film's wacky-trippy bending of space and time, [Cumberbatch] manages to steer an ideal path -- taking the role seriously but allowing himself to be flummoxed by it, wittily traumatised and taken off-guard."
doctor-strange,Jack Shepherd,False,"Oct 24, 2016","Director Scott Derrickson creates a cinematic experience straight from the comic books, an incredible feat that needs to be seen on the big screen."
doctor-strange,Helen O'Hara,False,"Oct 24, 2016","Happily, it's [Marvel 's] most impressive visual film yet."
doctor-strange,Chris Nashawaty,False,"Oct 24, 2016",Doctor Strange is thrilling in the way a lot of other Marvel movies are. But what makes it unique is that it's also heady in a way most Marvel movies don't dare to be.
doctor-strange,William Bibbiani,False,"Oct 24, 2016","At its best it's a consciousness-expanding head trip of fantastic proportions, and at its worst it's merely an entertaining superhero movie."
doctor-strange,Rob Vaux,False,"Oct 24, 2016","When you add the unique visuals that a character like this can facilitate, it makes Doctor Strange one of the more interesting entries in Hollywood's 600-lb. gorilla of a franchise."

doctor-strange,Peter Bradshaw,False,"Oct 24, 2016","It's a tremendously engaging and likeable superhero ride, in which the classiest of casts show they know exactly where to take it seriously - and where to inject the fun."
doctor-strange,Scott Mendelson,True,"Oct 24, 2016","The visuals are worth the price of admission, but this is as generic and by-the-numbers an origin story as the MCU has ever made. It's better than 'Green Lantern,' but it will remind you of 'Green Lantern'."
doctor-strange,Stefan Pape,False,"Oct 24, 2016",Fantastic and brilliant! The effects will blow your mind!
doctor-strange,James Mottram,False,"Oct 24, 2016","Cumberbatch fits Doctor Strange like a pair of snap-tight surgical gloves, in yet another MCU triumph. Beautifully designed, brilliantly executed."
doctor-strange,Tom Huddleston,False,"Oct 24, 2016","Derrickson promised this would be 'weird and wild', and so it is - at least within the context of a major Hollywood blockbuster."

doctor-strange,Eric Eisenberg,False,"Oct 23, 2016","There are certainly shades of Iron Man and Thor, but what the film brings to the table to balance out its familiar elements is some of the most bombastic, exciting and beautiful action sequences we've seen in modern blockbusters."
doctor-strange,Tim Grierson,False,"Oct 23, 2016","Entertaining in its grand flourishes but spottier when it comes to character work and thematic coherence, the film boasts a slightly darker and more mystical air than its peers, accentuated by some of the most arresting set pieces in the MCU canon."
doctor-strange,Don Kaye,False,"Oct 23, 2016","The acting, the visual fireworks and Michael Giacchino's distinctive, Eastern-influenced score all go a long way toward disguising the fact that we are once again watching an origin story, and one that seems even a bit more perfunctory than usual."
doctor-strange,David Ehrlich,False,"Oct 23, 2016","If ""Doctor Strange"" can be dispiritingly safe, it can also be just as impressively bold - an hallucinogenic trip along a very familiar path, watching the film is like adding a large dose of LSD to your morning commute."

doctor-strange,Brian Truitt,False,"Oct 23, 2016",A kaleidoscope of weirdness and innovative visual effects successfully introduce the newest Marvel superhero in director/co-writer Scott Derrickson's brilliantly bizarre Doctor Strange.
doctor-strange,Peter Debruge,False,"Oct 23, 2016","The key is an in-on-the-joke script, which Derrickson co-wrote with Jon Spaihts and C. Robert Cargill, that ingeniously navigates major plot potholes even as it saddles its actors with ludicrous dialogue. But what actors!"
doctor-strange,Gregory Ellwood,False,"Oct 23, 2016",A visual wonder... but you still feel the formula straining.
doctor-strange,Matt Singer,False,"Oct 23, 2016",Marvel's familiar formula with some really cool visuals.
doctor-strange,Jen Yamato,False,"Oct 23, 2016",More mature than its predecessors and the first blockbuster of the modern superhero era ideally viewed on a magic mushroom trip.
doctor-strange,Alonso Duralde,False,"Oct 23, 2016","Casts a few impressive spells of its own, not the least of which is the redemption of the visual-effects extravaganza. This funny, freaky adventure reminds us of how effective VFX can be when they've got some imagination behind them."
doctor-strange,Mike Ryan,False,"Oct 23, 2016","Doctor Strange is basically a reboot of Iron Man, only with a lot more prettier things to look at while you're stoned. It's a good strategy. And it works."
eternals,Jackson Weaver,True,"Oct 16, 2023",Eternals the movie suffers from the same thing The Eternals comic did — it focuses more on a concept than it does on characters.
eternals,Rick Bentley,True,"Aug 10, 2023",The Eternals is a jumbled mess because it has to include the origin story plus detail the long lives of the 10 major characters.
eternals,Serena Seghedoni,False,"Aug 3, 2023","Chloé Zhao‘s Eternals is Marvel’s most philosophical film to date, teaching us about evolution, humanity, love, and the nature of good and evil."
eternals,Zach Pope,False,"Jul 26, 2023","Chloe Zhao’s Eternals   is a triumphant! A slow burning story that was epic in nature, beautiful in character development, & Brutal when in its action scenes. So many thoughts, so much ambition, but truly something that the MCU hasn’t seen yet."
eternals,Jillian Chilingerian,True,"Jul 26, 2023",Eternals has its moments but its massive scale never allows the characters to live in their world.
eternals,Manuel São Bento,False,"Jul 25, 2023","Chloé Zhao still follows some of Marvel's success formulas, but her unique style brings new attributes to the cinematic universe, such as the distinctly gorgeous cinematography and the profound themes of faith and humanity."
eternals,Emma-Jane Betts,False,"Jul 25, 2023","There are plenty of good ideas here, singular moments to love and appreciate. But at the end of the day, the writing for Eternals trips itself up."
eternals,Tina Kakadelis,False,"Jul 25, 2023","Ultimately, Eternals is a superhero movie for people who don’t like the usual superhero fare. It’s far more concerned with grand emotions and the thin line between hero and god than it is with quippy one-liners and over-the-top action."
eternals,Benjamin Wiebe,True,"Feb 13, 2023","As a whole, it’s somewhere in the middle; and I hope it’s not the last time Marvel allows a prestigious director to take a shot in the MCU and give a bold take on the formula, flaws and all."

eternals,Taylor Baker,False,"Nov 18, 2022",The narrative is simultaneously too large and too small. With personal relationships defining the narrative of a cosmos spanning opera ... As far as MCU goes though this isn't a terrible direction for them to explore.
eternals,M.N. Miller,True,"Oct 21, 2022","[Chloé Zhao’s] Marvel debut is the opposite of anything she’s ever done — she has created something stale, repetitious, and heavy-handed. I’m sorry to say Eternals is a massive disappointment."
eternals,Breeze Riley,False,"Aug 17, 2022",The result is a beautiful look into the joys and sorrows of humanity that also doubles as an entry point into some of Marvel’s stranger cosmic storytelling.
eternals,Keith Garlington,True,"Aug 16, 2022","I couldn’t help but think of how it would have fared better as a Disney+ streaming series. There’s very little here that screams big screen movie, and giving the characters and their stories more room to develop would have helped tremendously."

eternals,Daniel Howat,False,"May 18, 2022","Eternals may be one of the weakest Marvel movies yet, but there is still enough to enjoy as it propels us into a new and uncertain future for the franchise."
eternals,Alachia Queen,True,"Apr 12, 2022",Chloé Zhao tries to shove a sappy essay on the virtues of mankind and the value of loving humanity despite its flaws into a lackluster superhero journey of ten vapid characters who spend the entire film disproving her theory.
eternals,Jimmy Cage,False,"Mar 15, 2022",ETERNALS is love! Chloé Zhao has created such a beautiful film. Her superheroes are awe-inspiring supernatural beings and at the same time so deeply human.
eternals,David Reddish,True,"Mar 13, 2022","We have to wonder what kind of movie Zhao would have made left to her own devices. We suspect it would have less CGI monsters and more ruminations on character, immortality and watching humanity evolve."
eternals,Thomas Stoneham-Judge,False,"Mar 4, 2022",Its a beautiful film to watch with visually stunning sequences worthy of the big screen experience.
eternals,Victoria Luxford,True,"Mar 3, 2022","A film that takes an age to arrive at a familiar place. Yes, there are a plethora of new terms, species, and legends to learn, but it all boils down to heroes preparing for the big battle at the end. Its visually impressive, but missing the sense of fun."
eternals,Vincent Schilling,False,"Feb 25, 2022","An interesting storyline in the Marvel Universe that in my opinion, proves how the status quo just might miss the most impactful reason comic books existed in the first place. In my view, comic readers will likely appreciate this movie more."

eternals,Josie Melendez,False,"Feb 16, 2022","Eternals is driven by a love story. One between lovers, duty, and legacy. Throughout the 157-minute runtime, viewers will have their eyes glued to the screen and rediscover what it means to be excited about something original."
eternals,Jeffrey Harris,True,"Feb 14, 2022","Marvel Studios' Eternals is a rare misfire. However, it has a few redeeming qualities. Chloe Zhao had some clear ambition, but the film fails to come together with likable, meaningful characters or a truly engaging plot"
eternals,Wesley Lovell,False,"Feb 12, 2022","With Eternals, Disney seems to have settled on a galaxy-spanning villain that could hang over the entirety of their Phase IV efforts, but the film might just feel too obvious to entice the legion of franchise fans to their latest lengthy story arc."
eternals,Jeff Nelson,True,"Feb 12, 2022",Eternals is as good as it could have been. The issues stem from the source material and the movie acts as a huge set-up for what's to come.

eternals,Joshua Axelrod,True,"Feb 10, 2022","Though there’s definitely some fun to be had with this film beyond Zhao’s glorious compositions, Eternals ends up being one of the more overwrought and, frankly, silly additions to the MCU canon."

eternals,Rosa Parra,False,"Jan 2, 2022","The abundance of story, characters, and world-building can be overwhelming, but Zhao approaches it brilliantly. Nanjiani saves this film for me."
eternals,Harris Dang,True,"Jan 1, 2022",Eternals is stuck between a rock and a hard place. It is too blatantly commercial to take advantage of the studio's new prestigious filmmaking talent and too outside the box to satisfy Marvel's audience.

eternals,Andrew Kendall,True,"Dec 17, 2021","In snatches, it gives us a genuine moment of visual specificity that works but it cannot keep up the weight of all the questions and implications that it depends on. If it must be all things to everyone, then it ends up being little unto itself."
eternals,Michael Blackmon,False,"Dec 17, 2021","Eternals is far from perfect, but it pushes the MCU into promising new territory....it feels like an amalgam of what Marvel does best - splendidly chaotic fight scenes, dazzling special effects, and stories that speak to who we are as human beings."
eternals,David Nusair,True,"Dec 13, 2021",...a completely misguided and misbegotten piece of work that stands as the absolute nadir of both the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Zhao's filmography...
eternals,Noah Berlatsky,True,"Dec 11, 2021","But at this point, the MCU formula has been recycled so often that sitting through these movies starts to feel eternal."

eternals,Jared Mobarak,False,"Nov 25, 2021",Zhao is quite literally providing us the best of both worlds as a result. Eternals simultaneously feels like an MCU film and a prestige picture with everything that entails.
eternals,Mattie Lucas,False,"Nov 24, 2021",A thoughtful and earthy epic that dares to ask big questions and acknowledge its characters' weaknesses.
eternals,Andrea Chase,True,"Nov 23, 2021",A philosophically dense film that stagnates under its own considerable weight as it dances through 7000 years of world cultures while never quite finding its groove.
eternals,Sean P. Means,False,"Nov 20, 2021","""Eternals"" isn't a terrible Marvel movie, just an average one. Considering the talent at work, and the potential of such a world-changing set of heroes, it could have been so much more."
eternals,Sean Gilman,True,"Nov 20, 2021",It's baffling how low-energy Eternals is. It looks like a film made by people who work in an office.
eternals,Mark Meszoros,True,"Nov 19, 2021",Eternals is a slow-paced affair that runs too long and never quite delivers heart-stopping moments.
eternals,Caroline Siede,False,"Nov 19, 2021","Eternals makes for an alienating first watch. ... Dig a little deeper, however, and this behemoth of a superhero flick has its rewards too."
eternals,Kevin A. Ranson,False,"Nov 19, 2021",... everything fans expect from Marvel Studios while still feeling a bit hollow... fuel for the imagination... angsty and lovelorn but adds few revelations to the who-wants-to-live-forever trope...
eternals,Justin Brown,False,"Nov 19, 2021",This movie needed better marketing as it was an epic drama with superheroes in it. The comic relief was very much needed because this was a pretty slow movie.

eternals,Tim Brennan,False,"Nov 15, 2021","Chloe Zhao has made a flawed film, it's true, though it's bursting with beauty and ambition. It's possible this might be the best-looking film in the MCU, and Zhao gifts us with strong cinematography and numerous shots of gorgeous vistas."

eternals,Zehra Phelan,False,"Nov 15, 2021",Zhao brings her flair for the beauty of the eye shots over vast landscapes...and it still delivers on the celestial plains of epic proportions. It's a cosmic opening for the next phase of the Marvel saga.

eternals,Robert Roten,False,"Nov 14, 2021","Introducing a dozen characters and establishing their backstories in an already busy plot is a heavy lift. Director Chloé Zhao (Nomadland) skillfully juggles all these elements, making an understandable 2.5 hour movie that covers all the bases."
eternals,Ed Whitfield,True,"Nov 13, 2021","What might have been a fascinating interplay of psychologies and ideas, is rendered in broad, lifeless strokes."
eternals,Mike McGranaghan,True,"Nov 13, 2021",Eternals is somehow Marvel's most ambitious movie and also its worst.
eternals,Paul Mount,True,"Nov 12, 2021","Eternals is dull, it's boring, and it's quite epically uninvolving."
eternals,Gemma Creagh,False,"Nov 12, 2021","Taking up space in such a well-mined universe can't be easy, but Eternals not only manages to hold its own, but delivers something engaging, unique, funny and warm."
eternals,Matt Baume,True,"Nov 12, 2021","The one exception to the film's utterly bloodless chemistry is a cameo by a post-credits pop star who, for all of 15 seconds, has a completely charming interaction with a CG creature. I believed that performance more than anything in the 2.5 hours."
eternals,Alison Gillmor,True,"Nov 12, 2021","Bring in the portentous overreach of the Eternals' cosmos-shaking storyline, though, and her talent is diminished. For Zhao, bigger is not better."

eternals,Amanda Reimer,False,"Nov 12, 2021",Eternals has a lot of heart and beauty that drips off the screen when you watch it.
eternals,Rachael Harper,False,"Nov 12, 2021","For a movie with ten protagonists, it's impressive that each character is given a unique personality."

eternals,Aine O'Connor,True,"Nov 11, 2021","Chloé Zhao's take on the Marvel Universe is a far cry from her last film, Nomadland. While Eternals has its moments, it is not one of the Marvel greats."
eternals,Nandini Ramnath,True,"Nov 11, 2021",The enthralling action set-pieces have to be parsed from in-between awkward moments in which characters stand around waiting to explain themselves. The wildly inconsistent tone moves from laugh-out-loud to deadly earnest...

eternals,Renuka Vyavahare,False,"Nov 11, 2021","Those who have followed Zhao's meditative, self-reflective work will know that her language of communication is a blend of deep silences and aching words."

eternals,Allen Adams,False,"Nov 10, 2021","Eternals isn't a complete success, with issues large and small. That said...it's an impressive effort. This is a BIG swing, and while it might not be a home run, we're looking at some solid contact. For an undertaking like this, that's a win."
eternals,Tim Brayton,True,"Nov 10, 2021","A slack film, in the way one gets to be when one has no pressing need to come in at a reasonable running time."
eternals,Ian Simmons,False,"Nov 9, 2021","The long and short of it is that, yes, Eternals is a colossal bore...for those lacking patience, heart, and imagination."

eternals,Robert Slack,True,"Nov 9, 2021","Eternals is not a good movie. It's not a good comic book movie, it's not a good action movie, it's not a good Marvel movie. It somehow feels overstuffed and empty at the same time. It's muddled and convoluted. It's a bland and boring and bewildering mess."
eternals,Kshitij Rawat,True,"Nov 9, 2021","Eternals is a mess, a beautiful mess, but a mess nonetheless. There is a far more interesting movie under all that flotsam. In better hands, the movie could have been something special. All Zhao has provided is a bland, dull film."

eternals,Christopher Machell,True,"Nov 8, 2021","For all its flaws, it is far from the worst entry in the MCU, but it is, perhaps, the first of Marvel's films to be less than the sum of its parts."
eternals,Kylie Cheung,True,"Nov 8, 2021","In many ways, what it means to be human is the central question that drives Eternals... But the movie's dizzying star power and twisty backstories render it too clunky and overstuffed to concisely answer said central question."
eternals,Erik Kain,False,"Nov 8, 2021","I really enjoyed Eternals despite it being too long, and one of the reasons was the humor. Another was just that it felt kind of quirky and different from most Marvel movies these days."

eternals,Lee McCoy,False,"Nov 8, 2021","Eternals is not perfect for the stumbling beginning and Jolie plays a character that doesn't seem fully fleshed out on screen. She doesn't quite fit in. But overall, it's one of the best MCU experiences for it's eccentric and endearing characters."
eternals,Alicia Gilstorf,False,"Nov 8, 2021","Eternals is a flawed experiment years ahead of its industry but, sooner or later, a film has to break the mold and prove superheroes are worthy of deeper, richer cinematic retellings."
eternals,Nathalia Aryani,False,"Nov 7, 2021","While it has big special effects scenes, it's not a formulaic Marvel film. While there are certainly typical action scenes, the movie digs deeper into the dynamic of multiple layers of relationships and dark human drama."
eternals,Michael Ward,False,"Nov 7, 2021",Eternals offers plenty to embrace...the overall production is just not effective enough to move into the upper echelon of Marvel films.

eternals,Kevin Fallon,True,"Nov 6, 2021",Eternals seems to exist in the bizarre liminal space between expectations and indifference.
eternals,Claudia Puig,True,"Nov 6, 2021","At a glacial pace of 2 hours and 37 minutes, the movie occasionally feels eternal, and it sags under that weight."
eternals,Mark Kermode,True,"Nov 6, 2021",I certainly can't get emotionally invested anymore...it's just a series of special effects interspersed with a bit of humor...

eternals,TK Burton,False,"Nov 5, 2021","It's enjoyable, and it's funny, and its actors truly are terrific. Perhaps it's too much of what it doesn't need, and not enough of what it does. Or maybe it's something simpler - maybe it's that Marvel's reach finally exceeded its grasp."

eternals,Graeme Tuckett,False,"Nov 5, 2021","Zhao's deep sense of the rhythms that pass unspoken between people... are exactly what makes Eternals such a memorable, unfamiliar and refreshing film to watch."
eternals,Abby Olcese,True,"Nov 5, 2021","Unfortunately, the film's strict adherence to the Marvel formula keeps the whole enterprise from really working."
eternals,Paul McGuire Grimes,False,"Nov 5, 2021","Chloe Zhao takes a huge swing here to shake it up for Marvel, and that's worth applauding."
eternals,Emmanuel Noisette,False,"Nov 5, 2021","Eternals tries to work with a lot of moving parts and takes some really big swings. Sometimes it hits, and sometimes it doesn't. For that reason, Eternals and Chloé Zhao deserve credit for giving the MCU something more original."
eternals,Damond Fudge,False,"Nov 5, 2021","Eternals is, to put it mildly, a vast undertaking in the storytelling department. This creates both pluses and minuses for the film."
eternals,Alan Ng,False,"Nov 5, 2021",Eternalsis a good film...not great...and presents a different slice of the enormous MCU pie.
eternals,Jon Espino,False,"Nov 5, 2021","If you're not put off by the ponderous pacing or the humble lack of gaudy flair, this film offers not only an evolution of the comic book film genre but also a revolution in representation."

eternals,Dan Lybarger,True,"Nov 5, 2021","Running almost long enough for a pair of films, Zhao flits between her characters and only occasionally gives them room to shine. If she cut her team down to the size of a basketball squad, there would be more room for chemistry and character development."
eternals,Todd Jorgenson,True,"Nov 5, 2021",All of the effects-driven spectacle serves a silly and overwrought story that leaves little room for meaningful character development or emotional depth.
eternals,Peter Rainer,True,"Nov 5, 2021",I don't think Zhao should be chided for attempting a film so seemingly outside her comfort zone. No director should have to commit to a career of specialization. The only qualm I have about Eternals is that it's not better.
eternals,Jennifer Heaton,False,"Nov 5, 2021","By the tale's end, it becomes clear that Eternals' true aspiration is to be an arthouse blockbuster in much the same vein as the works of Denis Villeneuve and The Wachowskis."
eternals,Ryan Syrek,False,"Nov 5, 2021","An amazingly talented cast - playing surprisingly nuanced characters - is forced to dial every performance to ""I can't believe Tide got the stain out!"" levels. It's Shakespeare by Cliff's Notes, a Kidz Bop Nirvana cover, a musical episode of The Wire."
eternals,Lauren Coates,True,"Nov 5, 2021",Eternals is a frustratingly dense and heinously overcomplicated film that loses Zhao's delicate filmmaking sensibilities in its rush to introduce swathes of new Marvel heroes.
eternals,Jeffrey M. Anderson,False,"Nov 5, 2021","If a movie is as good as its characters, then 'Eternals' is still a good movie, one that I've been enjoying thinking about again and again."

eternals,Jason Escamilla,False,"Nov 5, 2021","Because there's so many characters to meet (all well-developed and unique), the structure of the narrative struggles with momentum."
eternals,Mark Kennedy,False,"Nov 5, 2021","The use of tendrils of light connecting the superheroes is impressive and the special effects at the end are truly mind-blowing, but the film is mostly saved by Nanjiani, whose humor and delivery makes him seem like he's in another movie."
eternals,Josh Wilding,False,"Nov 5, 2021","A powerful, sweeping exploration of love, life, and the MCU's history, Eternals occasionally stumbles, but when it soars, this is Marvel Studios at its magnificent best."
eternals,Dan Murrell,True,"Nov 5, 2021",I admire the ambition. I worry that Marvel will take away the message not to take any more chances and return to formula. That's not the right decision.

eternals,Steven D. Greydanus,True,"Nov 5, 2021","There is plenty to criticize in Eternals-and some things that I might praise, in another story set in another universe-but I'm not sure any story set in this universe could possibly offer anything to care about one way or the other."

eternals,Brandon Avery,False,"Nov 5, 2021","Eternals is bold, beautiful, and brilliant. Unlike anything the MCU has seen before."
eternals,Ruth Maramis,False,"Nov 5, 2021","Eternals is not a bad movie per-se, just an immensely underwhelming one. These cosmic beings are portrayed as saviors of humanity who care about mere mortals, but the filmmakers seem to forget to give us a reason to care for ANY of them."

eternals,John Lui,False,"Nov 4, 2021","Zhao, an arthouse director known for her award-winning dramas that imbue working-class struggles with poetry was hired to add a touch of prestige drama to a comic-book tale. She elevates the material in some places."

eternals,Jason Shawhan,False,"Nov 4, 2021","It's not a drastic enough change to freak out the faithful or demolish the formula, but it's a pleasant enough experience, and its aesthetic instinct skews toward the pretty and expansive."

eternals,Akhil Arora,True,"Nov 4, 2021","Zhao unfurls the story of the Eternals on an epic and elaborate stage ... that ends up being a double-edged sword. We get a grandiose mythology ... alongside backstories ... [but] we are never given the time to understand, care for, or connect with them."
eternals,Peter Bradshaw,True,"Nov 4, 2021","There are some nice touches and an attractive new diversity worn lightly, but this is an underpowered and uncertain film."
eternals,James Berardinelli,True,"Nov 4, 2021","Eternals, despite trying to be a departure from the superhero generic norm, misses wide of the mark and ends up being a major lapse."

eternals,Travis Hopson,False,"Nov 4, 2021","While it ultimately gives in to the demands of the MCU,Eternalsstrives to be more than just another superhero movie. It's the reason why it has won me over, and may be the reason why it won't work for others."
eternals,Tania Lamb,True,"Nov 4, 2021","Call me basic, but I miss the old Marvel. Eternals is not all bad, and will appeal to many. An unnecessary sex scene makes it non-kid-friendly for some families."

eternals,Jim Schembri,True,"Nov 4, 2021","Sluggishly directed, it's a thunderously dull bland-out stuffed with all the things we've seen quite enough of: fights with big-jawed monsters; eyes that shoot energy beams; self-important longueurs; an all-but-incomprehensible story. Seriously: enough."
eternals,Susan Kamyab,False,"Nov 4, 2021","One of the best things about ""Eternals"", is how it feels like a superhero movie for everyone. If you have yet to feel seen through a hero, then you might connect with one of these diverse characters."

eternals,Alex Bentley,True,"Nov 3, 2021","Perhaps Eternals will gain traction the more we get to see what the rest of the MCU's Phase 4 involves. On its own, though, the story lacks the excitement that audiences have come to expect from Marvel films."

eternals,Michael Phillips,True,"Nov 3, 2021","This movie is more risk-prone than the majority of Marvel titles. Yet it frustrates, even beyond a screenplay full of self-competing interests. And as far as MCU fatigue goes - well, at this point, it goes pretty far."

eternals,Peter Sobczynski,True,"Nov 2, 2021","Zhao is an undeniably gifted filmmaker, but Eternals does not make effective use of those gifts and by the end, there is the undeniable sense that she became as tired of the whole thing while making it as viewers will be while watching it."

eternals,Alan Cerny,False,"Nov 1, 2021","Eternals is not a bad movie. It is ambitious and tries hard to be different from the rest. However, it is ultimately unsatisfying in that most of the film is full of promises for other stories to come. Let us hope those promises are not empty ones."
eternals,Bill Goodykoontz,False,"Nov 1, 2021","""Eternals"" isn't a bad movie. It's just not a particularly satisfying one, its scale proving untamable, even for Zhao."
eternals,Matt Lynch,True,"Nov 1, 2021",A jumble of clunky dialogue and exposition dumps with no stakes until the typical VFX-packed climactic fights. Eternals is one of the most flavorless films in the Marvel Universe.

eternals,Avi Offer,False,"Nov 1, 2021","One of the most humanist MCU movies ever made. It's an exhilarating, suspenseful and visually dazzling spectacle with a surprisingly warm, beating heart. By treating the characters as human beings, Zhao treats the audience as human beings, too."

eternals,Kaitlyn Booth,False,"Oct 31, 2021","Eternals is going to be a divisive movie because it doesn't really work at the end of the day. There is too much exposition, the pacing and structure are a mess, and the story of love in all its forms gets lost."

eternals,Megan Basham,True,"Oct 29, 2021","This sounds kind of fun. And I wish it were. But with the exception of Kumail Nanjiani who offers, without question, the only real reason to see the movie, the story takes itself far too seriously for fun or, really, even logic."
eternals,Murjani Rawls,True,"Oct 29, 2021","Ultimately, the film feels like a pet between two owners, and it's confused on exactly who to run to."
eternals,Stephen Silver,True,"Oct 29, 2021","A particular dud, and Marvel's worst in years. The mythology is ridiculous, the cast overstuffed, and the action unimpressive."
eternals,Rosie Knight,False,"Oct 29, 2021","Tropes be damned, Zhao carves out unexpectedly human immortals who actually care about each other. They love and hate and fight and forgive and feud and feel together. It's a refreshingly emotional take."

eternals,Don Shanahan,False,"Oct 29, 2021","Such heady motivations, coupled with heroism, is a lovely core away from the usual costumed good vs. evil throwdowns, but it's very, very profuse, complete with all of the intergalactic gibberish in between."
eternals,Peter Travers,False,"Oct 29, 2021","A Marvel epic that values personal connections over spectacle? Sorry adrenaline junkies, but that's what Oscar-winning, indie director Chloe Zhao brings to her first blockbuster. The result is uneven, but memorably inclusive and unique."
eternals,Leo Brady,True,"Oct 29, 2021","In many ways Eternals is not a Chloe Zhao problem as much as it is an MCU problem. After the lights came back on my first thought was that this is where comic book movies have ""jumped the shark""."

eternals,Jeremy Jahns,False,"Oct 29, 2021","In the end, the movie was reliably entertaining as, generally speaking, the MCU is... [But] the concept of Eternals is a lot more interesting than the execution of Eternals."
eternals,Nick Johnston,True,"Oct 29, 2021","It's ugly, charisma-free, dour, overlong, exposition-heavy, patronizing, and, worst of all, it has none of the heart even feinted at by the least successful films within the MCU canon."
eternals,Walter Chaw,True,"Oct 28, 2021",it's pretty clear that Zhao's empathy for unaffected performers rambling in lingering magic-hour landscapes has won the day.

eternals,Luke Y. Thompson,False,"Oct 28, 2021",For viewers with an interest in theology and the repackaging of same as superhero subtext for the masses - this is compelling stuff. But for those who expect the tightly wound Marvel machine... this isn't that.

eternals,Patricia Puentes,True,"Oct 27, 2021",Watching Chloé Zhao's The Rider made me want to learn horseback riding. Nomadland illustrated the reality houseless Americans face and offered a window into the American West. Both intertwine fiction and reality. I knew Eternals was going to be different.
eternals,Diego Andaluz,False,"Oct 27, 2021","While Eternals may be Chloé Zhao's most conventional effort and falls prey to the typical faults of the franchise, she manages to elevate the blockbuster formula to craft one of Marvel's best films yet."
eternals,Rohan Patel,False,"Oct 27, 2021","Marvel has its first existential crisis, coming to terms with not only what it means to be a hero but also what it means to be a God. It's extremely ambitious, and while it doesn't completely soar, it still opens a whole new realm of possibilities."
eternals,Brian Orndorf,True,"Oct 27, 2021","Involves a lot of windy locations, sparse imagination for action, and a cast of characters who are seldom interesting."
eternals,Sean Chandler,True,"Oct 27, 2021","While I can respect that the MCU took a risk by telling an ambitious and different kind of story, the story and storytelling simply didn't match the film's ambitions."

eternals,K. Austin Collins,True,"Oct 27, 2021","Eternals is so busy showing off what it can do, where it can go, that it bypasses and overlooks what it really has to offer.

eternals,Mike Sorrentino,True,"Oct 27, 2021","While I appreciate that Eternals takes a creative risk with its time-jumping events, its convoluted plot ultimately lets it down."
eternals,Germain Lussier,True,"Oct 27, 2021","Eternals feels like a balloon that tried to hold it all together but was filled to bursting; it's too much-and not enough. The result is a very ambitious, very well made, kind of flat, and unfortunately forgettable film."
eternals,Brian Lloyd,True,"Oct 27, 2021","It flies high, grapples with huge themes and ideas, tries to keep check with humour and heart, but the whole thing feels so overblown and overwrought that you kind of walk out of the screen in a daze."

eternals,Douglas Davidson,False,"Oct 27, 2021","Zhao's Eternals may just set a precedent that could revitalize the MCU moving forward by leaning on its adult themes and new opportunities. This won't be for everyone, that's for sure. But it's exciting nonetheless."
eternals,Julian Roman,True,"Oct 27, 2021",The Marvel Cinematic Universe wades chin deep into a soap opera river of melodramatic tears. Director Chloé Zhao treads sappy with a convoluted exploration of relationships in Eternals.
eternals,Austin Burke,False,"Oct 26, 2021","This film is massive on every level, both with its story and scale. At times, the narrative can come across as a bit messy, but its heart always shines through. Zhao has crafted something so different from the rest of the MCU."

eternals,Sean Mulvihill,False,"Oct 26, 2021","At times Zhao's superhero epic is able to breakaway from the Marvel mold, but in the end the movie is still beholden to the broader MCU."
eternals,Lupe Rodriguez Haas,False,"Oct 26, 2021","While the film is bogged down in exposition, Chloé Zhao delivers a very meaningful superhero Marvel film that ponders the question of whether the human race is worth saving. This MCU entry has an indie spirit but delivers great action too."

eternals,Carla Hay,False,"Oct 26, 2021","Eternals has the expected thrilling action scenes but the non-action scenes might be too quiet and introspective for some fans ... However, the showdowns in the last third of the movie make up for the meandering story in the rest of Eternals."
eternals,Louisa Moore,True,"Oct 26, 2021","This big budget action film will hit theaters just in time for Thanksgiving, which reaches the chef's kiss of utter perfection because it's a $200 million turkey."
eternals,Robert Kojder,False,"Oct 26, 2021","It doesn't always work, but it is undeniably the most ambitious Marvel movie (and it didn't need 25 other movies as stepping stones to a colossal-length grand finale), pitting religious and familial duties against one another"

eternals,Danielle Broadway,False,"Oct 25, 2021",The film speaks to what it means to be pawns in someone else's game and be forced to find reasons to continue. Each character seems passionate about moving forward without the reigns of their Celestial creator.

eternals,Perri Nemiroff,True,"Oct 24, 2021",The weight of complicated exposition weakens the energy of Eternals a little too often. It's at its best when the focus is on the Eternals recreating their family -- the humor of it and the passion when they fight for each other and the things they love.
eternals,Don Kaye,False,"Oct 24, 2021","Eternals itself is far from perfect, but it does indicate that the Marvel movie factory is not content to rest on its already massive bed of laurels."

eternals,Robbie Collin,True,"Oct 24, 2021","It's constantly engaged in a kind of grit-toothed authenticity theatre, going out of its way to show you it's doing all the things proper cinema does, even though none of them bring any discernible benefit whatsoever to the film at hand."
eternals,Pete Hammond,False,"Oct 24, 2021",Zhao seamlessly uses expert filmmaking skills weaned on a smaller scale to great effect on this HUGE canvas.

eternals,Robert Abele,False,"Oct 24, 2021","After so many Marvel movies that give lip service to the thornier ramifications of its hero narratives, there's an earnestness to the operatic stakes in ""Eternals"" that somehow helps fuse what's physically spectacular and philosophical about it."

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2,Chris Sawin,False,"Sep 2, 2019",The sequel has too much of a good thing with comedy being exaggerated for far longer than it has any right to be and a story that could have been edited to trim excessive bickering and a specific Taserface joke that loses its oomph due to overuse.

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2,John Serba,False,"May 8, 2017","It's a little bit funnier, and shows a smidgen more technical panache, than the first, but sticks to its successful formula, and therefore satisfies in much the same way."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2,Anthony Lane,True,"May 8, 2017","Let's hope that Vol. 3 recaptures the fizz of the original, instead of slumping into the most expensive group-therapy session in the universe."

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2,Dana Barbuto,False,"May 7, 2017","If you were a fan of the first (I was) you'll dig the next chapter, but your enjoyment will depend on your tolerance for redundancy ... and your willingness to succumb to Chris Pratt's humor and hotness."

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2,Diva Velez,False,"May 7, 2017","The tepid Vol. 2 survives mostly on our affection for the characters we met in the first film, but without that intro, it's a middling slog with precious little of the freshness or audacity that made the original such a standout."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2,Jim Schembri,False,"May 6, 2017","There is fun to be had as the team of renegade space pirates return...with some funny, impressive action sequences [but it] turns into a high-concept mess involving reel upon reel of planetary destruction, a VFX cliche we are seeing way too much of."

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2,Alison Willmore,False,"May 5, 2017","[Yondu's] presence kicks the idling movie into gear, and into a final third act for which all of the previous meandering can be forgiven - and the talk of family finally accrues the weight the film has been trying to put on it."

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2,Peter Sobczynski,False,"May 5, 2017","In much the same way that the film as a whole is better this time around, the performances have also improved... partly because the actors have done a better job of finding just the right approach to the material."

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2,Steve Crum,False,"May 5, 2017","This second volume is pretty terrific, a must-see. It suffers a bit from being a sequel in that characters are already firmly defined. (The revelation of their personas was a plus in the previous film.)"

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2,Jeff Beck,False,"May 4, 2017","Trying to make a sequel that was going to be as good or feel as fresh as the original was a near-impossible task, but Gunn has managed to deliver a film that's a hell of a lot of fun to watch, while also giving it depth and heart to spare."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2,Christopher Machell,True,"May 4, 2017","Quill's family-versus-friends dilemma aspires to The Empire Strikes Back, but though the tin ear dialogue is certainly Lucas-esque, Vol. 2's thematic reach far extends its grasp."

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2,Ty Burr,True,"May 4, 2017","The sharp comic timing and devil-may-care breeziness of the original only return intermittently, and the new film's emphasis is on family feuds and forgiveness. It's heavy on the feels. There are hugs."

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2,Matthew Razak,False,"May 3, 2017","The first movie was such a surprise and so damn charming, that it's impossible for Vol. 2/i> to regain that feeling, but it makes its own, and it owns it. Even if it didn't it has baby Groot."

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2,Cary Darling,False,"May 3, 2017","[In the end credits] you get to hear ""Flashlight"" by that original group of interstellar misfits, Parliament.

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2,Peter Travers,False,"Apr 28, 2017",Vol. 2 still has the loosey-goosey feel of a rogue epic that the kids made when the grown-ups weren't watching. Only a turd blossom could resist it.
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2,Matt Donato,False,"Apr 28, 2017","Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 may not boast the same polished storytelling, but this Groot scootin' interplanetary disco once again kicks ass on James Gunn's own zany terms."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2,Matthew Norman,False,"Apr 28, 2017","Vol 2 isn't as spectacularly zingy as its predecessor - the law of diminishing returns applies in spades to the shock power of genre-subverting cinema - but that inevitability apart, the sequel is every inch an equal."

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2,MaryAnn Johanson,True,"Apr 27, 2017","Thinks it's edgy and transgressive, the punk little brother of all those other stodgy comic-book movies, but it isn't. It's just slightly more candy-colored."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2,Rafer Guzman,False,"Apr 27, 2017","Any action film that sets its opening sequence to ELO's ""Mister Blue Sky"" can't be all bad, but the ""Guardians"" franchise will need more than an excellent vinyl collection from here on out."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2,Kim Newman,False,"Apr 27, 2017","The smallness of the story - it's all about petty gripes, projected as a threat to the whole galaxy - hampers the unironic aspiration to infinite wonder, which powers the cosmic reaches of the Marvel universe."

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2,Robbie Collin,False,"Apr 24, 2017","That sense of gooey euphoria runs through everything that's good in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2, which inches even further to the end of the limb the original Guardians film went out on in 2014."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2,Peter Bradshaw,False,"Apr 24, 2017","It's fun, though GOTG2 doesn't have the same sense of weird urgency and point that the first film had."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2,Owen Gleiberman,False,"Apr 24, 2017","Shot for shot, line and line, it's an extravagant and witty follow-up, made with the same friendly virtuosic dazzle. Yet this time you can sense just how hard the series' wizard of a director, James Gunn, is working to entertain you."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2,Stefan Pape,False,"Apr 24, 2017","It's a true masterclass in storytelling, and Gunn's screenplay is tantamount to this, particularly impressive in how we understand and care for this myriad of characters - not always an easy task where ensemble features of this nature are concerned."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2,Eric Kohn,False,"Apr 24, 2017",Gunn remains a wizard of a nearly impossible task. The ex-Troma director is ideally suited to transform what should be a hokey B-movie into one of Marvel's most audacious ongoing storylines.
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2,Terri Schwartz,False,"Apr 24, 2017","The second film is far denser and has a few more pacing and story problems than the first. Still, it's a very good movie with one of the most emotionally impactful endings of any Marvel Cinematic Universe story yet."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2,Fred Topel,True,"Apr 24, 2017","Even the things people liked about the first movie get exaggerated until it's not cute anymore. Since everyone loved the blacklight joke, there are now constant sex jokes. Everyone loved Baby Groot in one scene, so now he's in the whole movie."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2,Brian Truitt,False,"Apr 24, 2017","Just like the first one, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a winning and wonderfully relatable gem of crazy."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2,Blake Howard,False,"Apr 24, 2017","""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" doesn't claim the title from its predecessor, but that does not make it a disappointment. The first film is a slice of percussive squash-buckling perfection that it was its own hard act to follow."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2,Eric Eisenberg,False,"Apr 24, 2017","While the sequel doesn't pack the full punch of the original, it's a wonderful follow-up that is richly dense in detail and features a parade of thrilling and fun surprises."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2,Louise Keller,False,"Apr 23, 2017","Visually stunning, the film is a blast: a joyous sci-fi fantasy outing filled with weird and wonderful characters, cheeky humour and a plot that offers just the right blend of emotional glue. It soars on the wings of imagination."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Jackson Weaver,False,"Oct 16, 2023","Now that nearly every other cinematic release reads like a holding pattern until they finally get around to mutants, Guardians Vol. 3 is the first sign in a while that Marvel might actually have some genuine enjoyment left in the tank."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Pete Vonder Haar,False,"Sep 8, 2023","GotG3 has no real tie-in to the larger MCU. There are a few references to Thanos, the Snap, and the Infinity Stones, but that's about it. This tracks with the trilogy as a whole, which has always stood outside the larger Marvel narratives."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Jeffrey Peterson,False,"Sep 7, 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a surprisingly risky blend of dark tones and sinister villainy with great visuals, tasty music, and the emotionality we expect."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Mini Anthikad-Chhibber,False,"Aug 27, 2023","While the fun, laughter, and quips, set to jukebox favourites that made this ragtag MCU family a joy to hang with are all present and correct, there are some problems with the Guardians’ third outing"

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Lee Zumpe,False,"Aug 23, 2023","It’s hopeful and poignant, filled with moments of empathy and integrity. Equal time is given to spectacle, with lots of stunning action sequences and psychedelic space weirdness."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,David Hogan,False,"Aug 17, 2023","While not as engaging or fresh as the first two films Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 still had the usual James Gunn combination of dazzling CG environments, enjoyable action and great dialogue, so it was still a fun way to spend an evening."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Cris Parker,False,"Aug 16, 2023",A gut punch of a film that had me in tears as much as it had me smiling.
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Rick Bentley,False,"Aug 8, 2023",Gunn weaves a story with Rocket that is as horrifying as it is heartwarming.

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Lucas Moore,True,"Aug 2, 2023",Rocket's origin story is great and the only highlight of the movie. Tonally it's all over the place and the runtime is about 25 minutes too long. After the brilliance of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1 we're left wondering what happened to this series.
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Manuel São Bento,False,"Jul 25, 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an emotionally powerful, tear-inducing ""farewell"" to James Gunn and his Guardians.

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Matthew Creith,False,"Jul 25, 2023","While the first two ""Guardians"" films might have been about Peter and the Guardians coming together, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is about the search for one's true identity and contribution to the greater good."

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Sarah Ward,False,"Jul 22, 2023","This farewell to part of the MCU always feels like a zippy, self-contained Guardians of the Galaxy movie, rather than a placeholder for more and more future franchise instalments."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,David Griffiths,False,"Jul 21, 2023",Everything comes together for this one – a brilliant screenplay from Gunn and his team of writers and a cast that seem to bring their best in what maybe some of their final times playing the characters that many cinema fans have come to know and love.
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Lauren Veneziani,True,"Jul 20, 2023","Emotionally manipulative, too much CGI, and not nearly as fun as the first Guardians of the Galaxy film."

[Full review in Spanish]"
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,John Serba,False,"Jul 7, 2023","It’s Gunn’s heart that shines brightest, though. His characters squabble like family but function wholly out of love for each other, which is precisely the thing that cuts through all the seemingly Marvel-mandated rigamarole."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Victor Stiff,False,"Jun 30, 2023","Gunn refuses to give his characters the type of obvious resolutions fandom pines for. Instead, he’s crafted the bitter-sweet ending his characters deserve."

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Brandon Collins,False,"Jun 13, 2023",I liked this better than the previous entry in the series. It was a heartfelt film but didn't really wrap up storylines the way the trailers implied.

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Jason Shawhan,False,"Jun 2, 2023","It’s been a while since we had something in this genre that really did this kind of narrative heavy lifting, rather than just playing in the sandbox that we know and love and are fine with just hanging out for a little while in."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Joshua Axelrod,False,"Jun 1, 2023","Its wild tonal swings and penchant for undercutting dramatic beats with poorly timed levity aside, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a mostly satisfying adventure and conclusion to arguably the MCU’s most unlikely trilogy."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Dan Buffa,False,"Jun 1, 2023","Bradley Cooper’s voice work has always been sharp, but he gets more to do here than in the first two films. There’s a whole piece of steak for his lovable space warrior to chew on here."

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Jared Mobarak,False,"May 26, 2023","There's a lot of tough love on display due to the fallout of everyone being a raw nerve.

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Matthew Lickona,False,"May 25, 2023","Remarkably, given the studio brand: this is absolutely Gunn's movie.

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Jessie Gender,False,"May 7, 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 not only provides an emotional ending to James Gunn's time with this crew; but also delivers the strongest and most meaningful, both in its characterization and its anti-fascist message, MCU movie since Avengers: Endgame."

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Keith Garlington,True,"May 6, 2023","It’s an overprocessed send-off that’s so focused on going out with a bang that it loses its joy, charm, and trust in us to actually feel things on our own."

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Noah Berlatsky,True,"May 6, 2023","When the Guardians get into a big group hug at the end of the film, it’s supposed to evoke love and solidarity. But it might better be characterized as the unity of capital, determined to offend no one and turn no one’s dollars away."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Alison Gillmor,False,"May 6, 2023","A kooky, messy grab-bag of a flick, the third and reportedly final entry in the Guardians of the Galaxy saga mixes up the good, the bad and the completely bizarre with lots of gonzo energy but sometimes questionable judgment."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Patrick McDonald,True,"May 6, 2023","90% of this was the situational emotion, and I didn't connect.

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Richard Propes,False,"May 6, 2023","I laughed a lot throughout Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 but, perhaps most surprisingly of all, I realized how much I cared about these Guardians and their presence in my galaxy."

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Lupe Rodriguez Haas,False,"May 6, 2023","Cutting back and forth between the light-hearted moments with the Guardians, and young Rocket’s story is jarring in tone and slows down the pacing.

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Ruth Maramis,False,"May 6, 2023",Gunn gets melancholic in his farewell to Marvel but hasn't lost his sense of fun. Rocket's backstory gets me bawling but there are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments to balance the somber mood.

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Peter Gray,False,"May 3, 2023","A course that needed correcting, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a healthy reminder of why we became so invested in these films in the first place."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Morgan Shaunette,False,"May 3, 2023","It does the same thing the previous movies did: shine a light on misfits and weirdos, celebrate their flaws and foibles, and prove that ingenuity, empathy and, yes, absolute silliness, are the most valuable forces in the galaxy."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,John Lui,False,"May 3, 2023","Vol. 3 retains the Gunn edge, channelled through the perfectly cast troupe of actors making up the Guardians."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Graeme Tuckett,False,"May 3, 2023",Gunn achieved something I was beginning to think Marvel couldn't do any more: he kept me engrossed throughout. Guardians 3 is also quite stunning to look at.

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Peter Howell,False,"May 3, 2023",It says something about the current state of superhero movies that the fate of a small frightened raccoon makes a stronger tug on the heart than any imperilled person or planet in the relentless Marvel Cinematic Universe.

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Brandon Avery,False,"May 3, 2023","The jokes and banter were hilarious even though some lingered on too long. However, director James Gunn loves the characters so much and it shows. This was an incredible conclusion to this Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Bob Chipman,False,"May 3, 2023",An emotionally resonant blockbuster (featuring Marvel's most evil villain ever!) that re-establishes James Gunn as one of the absolute top-class creators working in modern Hollywood. This is the one you've been waiting for - an absolute stunner.
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Sherin Nicole,False,"May 3, 2023","There are three movies here and I like two of them. GotG3 can be snide and ridiculous but what makes it work is Gunn’s ability to find the heart of a story, ridicule or explode it, and allow it to envelope his audience."

It's heavy. Really heavy."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Perri Nemiroff,False,"May 3, 2023","Guardians movies are always a blast, but the beating heart of the series is the unlikely family and how they come to love and value one another. That element is as strong as ever in Vol. 3."

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Oliver Jones,True,"May 3, 2023","Unfortunately, the film from writer-director James Gunn... creates worlds that it either destroys or simply grows bored with moments later and reduces what should be complicated relationships into reductively earnest proclamations."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Katie Walsh,False,"May 3, 2023","Gunn is a filmmaker with nothing to lose in the MCU, and for the end of his trilogy, his Marvel swan song, “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,” he throws it all at the wall with a satisfying splat."

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Brian Lloyd,False,"May 3, 2023","It rounds out the story of this group of misfit weirdos with a convincing and emotional finish, rather than trying to artificially force it on for another few years - something that's all too common in this genre."

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Glen Weldon,True,"May 3, 2023",To watch Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is to watch a filmmaker under the wildly mistaken belief that the best way to get you to absorb what he's saying is by screaming it directly into your ear.
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Leo Brady,False,"May 3, 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 has all the highs and lows, plenty of laughs and thuds, and bonds together as a family to make for a great final ride."

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Alastair McKay,False,"May 3, 2023","It’s wild stuff, but much like the film’s more psychedelic sci-fi elements, it works because of the effort that’s gone into creating rounded characters and a richly textured universe."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,John Kirk,False,"May 2, 2023","Rocket Raccoon’s story is the heart of this film.

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Catalina Combs,False,"Apr 30, 2023",It is intense and grabs hold of the audience’s emotions from the beginning to the end. Gunn’s screenplay takes what we know and intricately weaves in backstory while enhancing the universe.

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Carla Hay,True,"Apr 28, 2023","It clumsily tries to blend mean-spiritedness with sentimentality. The new characters in this saga are hollow and horribly written. Most of the returning hero characters are often smug and irritating,"

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Kirsten Acuna,False,"Apr 28, 2023","Gunn delivers an emotional sendoff for his ragtag group of misfits that possesses the humor and heart of the first two movies.

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Tania Lamb,False,"Apr 28, 2023",A very solid ending for this trilogy. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 was the first time I've wanted to join this squad. Not for all kids as they upped the violence but did cut back on the crass content.
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Mike Massie,False,"Apr 28, 2023","It may be a haphazard journey, but the finale is so splashy, high-octane, and colossal (essentially adopting the sensibilities of Bollywood undertakings) that it largely saves the film from the earlier tedium."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Annie Banks,True,"Apr 28, 2023","Considering the amount of time that was given for Gunn to perfect the Guardians' final bow, it's incredibly disappointing that the last entry into the Guardians trilogy is its weakest link."

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Don Shanahan,False,"Apr 28, 2023","The jovial intimacy brims throughout every heroic character interaction from all involved. In the end, the quality time of hugs are cooler than any perilous gunshot, slashing blade, or punching power move."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,EJ Moreno,True,"Apr 28, 2023",Cue the Sarah Mclachlan music because James Gunn is trying hard to make you feel things. This ends up as a tonal mess that relies on Disney-style emotional manipulation.

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Kaitlyn Booth,False,"Apr 28, 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 isn't perfect, but it works more than it doesn't, and it hits the emotional beats. It also provides the rare sense of closure that is so rarely gifted to this genre."

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Neil Smith,False,"Apr 28, 2023","So comfortable are the leads now in their spacesuits that they have the feel of a cosily familial ensemble. If there’s a standout, though, it’s Karen Gillan’s Nebula."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Aaron White,False,"Apr 28, 2023",Absolutely exhausting. A sensory overload of CGI spectacle with oh so very much yelling. But also thoroughly hilarious & heartfelt. Gunn's signature weird creativity is on full display & it somehow leads to a tremendously emotionally effective send-off.
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,David Fear,True,"Apr 28, 2023","Solemnity is the guiding light here, and solemnity doesn’t suit the Guardians.

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Charlotte O'Sullivan,False,"Apr 28, 2023",... The last instalment of James Gunn’s ribald and outrageously tender MCU series is all about the difficulty of being understood.
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Courtney Howard,False,"Apr 28, 2023","Bright, gorgeously rendered spectacle and these misfits’ unique brand of witty banter buoy a meaningful tale centered on family, fidelity and friendship that doesn’t just feel earned, but also profound."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Kate Erbland,False,"Apr 28, 2023","The Guardians appeal because their hard-won bonds feel real, even within the confines of the outsized MCU and the particular environs the space jerks find themselves in."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,David Sims,False,"Apr 28, 2023","Guardians 3 is a cheerful goodbye to many of the studio’s best heroes, who somehow managed to get through an entire series without being ruined by the larger superhero universe they inhabit. For Marvel, that’s both a win and a problem."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Brian Tallerico,False,"Apr 28, 2023","This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late—bloated runtime, things-go-boom finale, too many characters—but there’s a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,William Bibbiani,False,"Apr 28, 2023","The success of Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 proves that it’s still possible for Marvel movies to hit and hit hard after more than 30 films, but also that it’s getting harder to pull that trick off."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Brian Orndorf,True,"Apr 28, 2023","An angrier, noisier, and sadder turn for the MCU, with Gunn straining for emotional manipulation as he makes his usual mess of things in the comic book realm."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Helen O'Hara,False,"Apr 28, 2023","James Gunn closes out his four-part trilogy with a triumph: a big, scrappy mix of humour and terror boasting a heart as big as Drax."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Wendy Lee Szany,False,"Apr 28, 2023","A great final chapter for the Guardians. This movie brought back the feels of when I watched Avengers: Infinity War/Endgame. It'll play with your emotions, a lot. Would have liked to see more of High Evolutionary but he's a great addition to the film."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Caitlin Chappell,False,"Apr 28, 2023",Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a heartfelt celebration of imperfection that welcomes everyone into the film's titular found family.
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,David Gonzalez,False,"Apr 28, 2023","Its epic performances, scope, & soundtrack cement this gem as one of the MCU's best. When I think of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 and the MCU, I think of Michael Corleone in The Godfather Part III, ""Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in."""
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Nicholas Barber,False,"Apr 28, 2023","This one may be the most unruly and excessive of the trilogy, but it is as sweetly touching as any film with so many slimy, tentacled monsters in it could be."

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Brady Langmann,False,"Apr 28, 2023","Now, as you peruse many a bring your tissues! review of Vol. 3, let me offer some counter-programming: this movie is hilariously gross, in a horror-comedy sort of way."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Clarisse Loughrey,False,"Apr 28, 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 is a farewell to the franchise (at least from Gunn’s perspective, as he’s since hopped over to DC), that’s really a reminder that they always represented some of the very best Marvel has to offer."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,A.A. Dowd,False,"Apr 28, 2023","The movie wears you down as much as it wears you out. It feels earnest in its mega-budget cringe, an expression of Gunn's sensibility as much as a play to appease stockholders."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Aaron Neuwirth,False,"Apr 28, 2023","Making a sincere summer blockbuster that’s one of Disney’s major franchise machines is no simple task, and yet here we are with a group of a-holes that we truly care about. It’s been a wild ride, but they managed to pull it off once more with feeling."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Nick Schager,False,"Apr 28, 2023","A bursting-at-the-seams adventure that, minor missteps aside, reminds viewers why this ragtag crew remains one of the MCU’s highlights."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Joshua Yehl,False,"Apr 28, 2023","Even though the plot has a bit too much going on, some of the humor feels stale, and Adam Warlock was woefully underused, the cast’s incredible chemistry and James Gunn’s soulful style remain unlike anything else in the MCU."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Lauren LaMagna,False,"Apr 28, 2023","“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” is an overall fun, exciting and emotional ending to what has been a consistently delightful trilogy within the MCU."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Peter Bradshaw,False,"Apr 28, 2023","Overlong, yes, and finally reaching for an importance and emotional closure (perhaps inspired by Gunn’s own emotional corporate redemption) that it doesn’t quite encompass... But it’s still spectacular, spirited and often funny."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Justin Chang,False,"Apr 28, 2023",Gunn’s obvious love for these characters has been the trilogy’s consistent and undeniable saving grace. And he notably doesn’t sell out that love as he brings those characters all to a conclusion.

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Patrick Cavanaugh,False,"Apr 28, 2023","An undeniably emotional experience that highlights James Gunn's strengths as a storyteller, and while it suffers from all the same shortcomings as other MCU fare, it sends the series out on a high note."

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Tessa Smith,False,"Apr 28, 2023",This is how you do a trilogy. It's the perfect ending. And the perfect new beginning. Every Guardian is allowed to complete their arc in a way that feels meaningful and impactful. James Gunn has done it again.
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Nicole Ackman,False,"Apr 28, 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is, in some ways, the strongest of its trilogy, but it suffers from being too much."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Germain Lussier,False,"Apr 28, 2023","[Gunn has] created a movie as audacious and surprising as the first one, but in newer, more confident and mature ways. Like the original it simultaneously makes you laugh, makes you cry, and makes you cheer. Did I mention crying?"
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Frank Scheck,False,"Apr 28, 2023","This edition largely succeeds like the other ones, thanks to the chemistry of the main ensemble, who have grown into their characters with relaxed ease. The interplay among them is frequently delightful."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Linda Marric,False,"Apr 28, 2023","A big, silly and disarmingly big-hearted film which makes the most of what made this film series one of the most loved in the franchise. A fond and fantastic farewell."

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Christie Cronan,False,"Apr 28, 2023",It definitely feels like a Guardians movie should - an overall emotional farewell. But Gunn turned up the volume the next level - and not necessarily in a good way. More like on deaf ears.

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Sheraz Farooqi,False,"Apr 28, 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a heartfelt and earnest conclusion to the trilogy.

guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Greg Nussen,True,"Apr 28, 2023",The film undermines its initial sense of intimacy and momentum with a stop-and-start story structure that by and large exists to make as much room as possible for its characters’ banter.
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Roger Moore,True,"Apr 28, 2023","These pictures have grown less cute, less charming and less fun with each passing installment, and this one just drags as it meanders towards its over-hyped lump-in-throat finale."
guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3,Matt Rodriguez,False,"Apr 28, 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an emotional, action-packed, ear-pleasing space opera that hits all the right beats. The Guardians have never looked this good."

guardians-of-the-galaxy,Sean Axmaker,False,"May 6, 2023","[James] Gunn does make the journey a lot of fun, with an oddball cast of renegades who, tossed together in a deep space prison, team up to escape and wind up staying together because it suits their purposes, but really because it sucks to be alone."

guardians-of-the-galaxy,Brent McKnight,False,"Jul 7, 2020","Combining huge, spectacle-scale special effects, giant practical sets, and a massive scale, Guardians also works on a narrative level, and as the story of strange, unique, very human-even when they're not-characters."

guardians-of-the-galaxy,Bernard Boo,False,"Mar 22, 2019","Gunn does a great job of preserving his wacky indie sensibilities and incorporating them seamlessly into a giant, crowd-pleasing blockbuster film, a feat that takes more finesse than his Troma-boy resume may lead you to believe he's capable of."
guardians-of-the-galaxy,Paula Fleri-Soler,True,"Mar 8, 2019","Given the type of tight storytelling we are used to from Marvel, Guardians feels like it could have used a little tweaking, both narratively and character-wise."
guardians-of-the-galaxy,Allen Adams,False,"Feb 20, 2019","Guardians of the Galaxy was an outside-the-box choice by Marvel; a huge gamble that paid off handsomely. It is epic space opera and well-constructed comedy, a visually stunning experience driven by exceptional performances."

guardians-of-the-galaxy,Molly Templeton,False,"Aug 28, 2018","There's much to like in this movie; it's not brilliant, and the fate of the world is never really in danger, but it's clever and glossy and all the things you'd expect from Marvel's B-team."
guardians-of-the-galaxy,Charlie Jane Anders,False,"May 21, 2018","Guardians of the Galaxy isn't just one of the year's best movies.

guardians-of-the-galaxy,Brigit Grant,False,"Aug 23, 2017","The action sequences, 3D or not, are text-book daring and explosive, but it is the music that raises the bar in this film as, during moments of extreme danger, a Seventies classic comes on to ease the tension."

guardians-of-the-galaxy,Jason Bailey,False,"Jun 18, 2016","For much of its 122 minutes, Gunn's grab-bag of quirky characters, genre ribbing, and incongruent '70s pop tunes goes over like gangbusters. The trouble is, it's only irreverent to a point."
guardians-of-the-galaxy,Katherine McLaughlin,False,"Jun 14, 2016",Gunn clearly knows his way round the genre and delivers a crowd pleasing summer blockbuster full of humour. Plus a raccoon brandishing a machine gun is all kinds of fun.
guardians-of-the-galaxy,Kristian M. Lin,False,"Jun 14, 2016","Some of the other entries in this series haven't been short on humor, but this is the first one where the humor is pretty much the whole point of the science-fiction extravaganza. It proves to be a nice change."
guardians-of-the-galaxy,Tony Norman,False,"Jun 14, 2016",Let's get down to brass tacks. Folks want to know if a movie featuring a gun-toting raccoon and a bipedal tree can possibly be any good. The short answer is -- yes!
guardians-of-the-galaxy,Ron Yamauchi,False,"Jun 14, 2016","Gunn has certainly given Marvel another successful product, with likable actors, comprehensible motivations, and clear fight staging, set at a pace that could fairly be described as rollicking."

guardians-of-the-galaxy,Giovanni Fazio,False,"Jun 13, 2016","What makes it all work, though, is the film's oddball sense of humour, and while this may all get a bit tired by the time we get to Guardians 3, for now, sit back and enjoy."
guardians-of-the-galaxy,Russell Baillie,False,"Jun 1, 2016","Guardians still feels fresh and funny and non-formulaic. They might have been comic-book margin-dwellers, but here they prove they're a headline act."
guardians-of-the-galaxy,J. Olson,False,"Apr 12, 2016","The unlikeliest of space operas, blending heady, CGI-heavy action with irreverent comedy and a hurricane of sloppy, wet kisses to 70s and 80s pop culture."

guardians-of-the-galaxy,Justin Gerber,False,"Jul 8, 2015",James Gunn's first foray into big-budget movie making succeeds despite focusing on characters largely unknown to mainstream audiences and provides some of the most genuinely affecting moments of any Marvel film to date.

guardians-of-the-galaxy,John Rodriguez,False,"Jul 8, 2015",The thing that makes Guardians of the Galaxy so wonderful is that it's completely bonkers.

guardians-of-the-galaxy,Josh Terry,False,"Jul 8, 2015","Guardians of the Galaxy may be the most unique film to come out of the Marvel stable so far. If the oppressive weight of late summer has you down, this movie may be just the thing you need."

guardians-of-the-galaxy,Jonathan Hatfull,False,"Jul 8, 2015","One of the most exciting things about Guardians Of The Galaxy is that it is a departure from the Marvel feature film template. Guardians Of The Galaxy is very much a Marvel movie, but it's also (way) out there, doing its own thing."

guardians-of-the-galaxy,Scott Renshaw,False,"Jul 8, 2015","Where other comic-book fare has felt like action blockbusters with sprinkles of comic relief, Gunn has been allowed to make a comedy that happens to feature comic-book characters."
guardians-of-the-galaxy,Robert Horton,False,"Jul 8, 2015",Gunn and his cast understand that the interplay among the quirky Guardians is what matters. The next Avengers movie already looks silly by comparison.

guardians-of-the-galaxy,Joe Morgenstern,False,"Jul 31, 2014","The people who made this movie must have had a swell time in the process, and it's nice to see a summer epic that takes itself so unseriously."
guardians-of-the-galaxy,Peter Canavese,False,"Jul 31, 2014","Lurches along a bit awkwardly, but always with utterly dazzling visuals and a goofy gag at the ready."
guardians-of-the-galaxy,Jason Buchanan,False,"Jul 31, 2014","If nothing else, Guardians feels like an invigorating throwback to the pop-culture properties that were Saturday-morning staples in the 1980s."
guardians-of-the-galaxy,Chris Knight,False,"Jul 31, 2014","What a joy it is to be present at the birth of a new franchise! Like human birth, it's messy and emotional and full of promise. And as long as there are no problems with the delivery, it's a fresh start."
guardians-of-the-galaxy,Kimberley Jones,False,"Jul 31, 2014",You can have the Avengers' supergroup of professional heroes and egos: I prefer the Guardians' garage band -- rowdy and rough-edged and a real family.

guardians-of-the-galaxy,Joe Gross,False,"Jul 31, 2014","For the most part, director and co-writer James Gunn delivers a solid action/comedy/ CGI spaceship combo, but far too much time is spent describing action and explaining motivations in the most leaden fashion possible."
guardians-of-the-galaxy,Joshua Starnes,False,"Jul 31, 2014","For all that doesn't work, a lot does and hopefully with time and distance, Gunn and his collaborators can chuck all of the non-silly stuff they just don't need for Guardians 2. They've got a firm foundation to build off of."
guardians-of-the-galaxy,Joe Williams,False,"Jul 31, 2014","If you're old enough to remember when sci-fi and comic books were fun, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" will be your new favorite movie. If you're not, it will set a standard for everything you see."
guardians-of-the-galaxy,Steve Persall,False,"Jul 31, 2014","Guardians of the Galaxy is fun but forgettable, or perhaps Gunn crams so much onto the screen that memory is crowded out. Definitely worth a second look, just to figure out what in the name of Buckaroo Banzai is going on."
guardians-of-the-galaxy,Peter Travers,False,"Jul 31, 2014","Guardians of the Galaxy does the impossible. Through dazzle and dumb luck, it turns the clichés of comic-book films on their idiot heads and hits you like an exhilarating blast of fun-fun-fun."
guardians-of-the-galaxy,Jeffrey Lyles,False,"Jul 31, 2014","It's been billed as the most out-there, bizarre and wacky of all the Marvel Studios films. Fortunately for comic book fans and audiences looking for a little something different it exceeds expectation to be the most fun-filled Marvel movie yet."
guardians-of-the-galaxy,Mara Reinstein,True,"Jul 31, 2014","It's like the silly, superhero-loving kids goofing off in the back of the classroom looked at The Avengers and X-Men and declared, ""Hey, how hard can it be to save the world? Let's do it too!"""

guardians-of-the-galaxy,Mark Dujsik,True,"Jul 31, 2014","There's a strong, likeable start to Guardians of the Galaxy, but from there, the movie begins a persistent slide into anonymity."
guardians-of-the-galaxy,Rich Phippen,False,"Jul 31, 2014","It's preposterous, ridiculous, bizarre. Whatever. It's not the most accessible Marvel outing, and it'll take the fanboys to spread the word; Guardians of the Galaxy is balls-out fun."
guardians-of-the-galaxy,Mick LaSalle,True,"Jul 31, 2014","In place of wit, ""Guardians"" offers a sort of generalized willingness to be amusing, an atmosphere of high spirits that feels like lots of people pumping air into a tire that has a hole in it."

guardians-of-the-galaxy,Michael O'Sullivan,False,"Jul 31, 2014","It's the funniest of any Marvel movie yet, lending the film a lightness that goes a long way toward deflating the grandiosity that sometimes inflates and bloats the studio's films."
guardians-of-the-galaxy,Chris Hewitt,False,"Jul 31, 2014","What Gunn does here better than any Marvel movie since the first ""Iron Man"" is to connect his movie with the reason fans love comic books in the first place: because they're fun."
guardians-of-the-galaxy,Glenn Kenny,False,"Jul 31, 2014","In many respects, ""Guardians"" ... is a fun and relatively fresh space Western."
guardians-of-the-galaxy,Stephen Silver,False,"Jul 31, 2014",I didn't care about the plot for a second- but I appreciated the over-arching spirit of fun. And the two CGI characters are the best parts of the movie
guardians-of-the-galaxy,Linda Holmes,False,"Jul 31, 2014","There's plenty of heart in Guardians, but it gets its emotional heft largely from the warmth that this kind of comedy inherently contains."

guardians-of-the-galaxy,Brian Orndorf,False,"Jul 31, 2014","It's balanced work and enormous fun, giving all the brand name superheroes a run for their money now that Marvel has cleared a path for the little guys to shine on the big screen."
guardians-of-the-galaxy,Rob Vaux,False,"Jul 31, 2014","Nothing ruins a good movie more than calling it a great one, and while Guardians of the Galaxy is good, no one will mistake it for a high point in the MCU."
guardians-of-the-galaxy,Frank Swietek,True,"Jul 31, 2014","The very empty-headedness...will probably insure its enormous success, since many in the audience will be able to identify with it."
guardians-of-the-galaxy,Bilge Ebiri,False,"Jul 31, 2014","The film seems content to be the class clown of the Marvel Universe, which is all well and good. But like most class clowns, sometimes you wish it would apply itself - because it seems capable of being so much more."

guardians-of-the-galaxy,Dustin Putman,False,"Jul 30, 2014","A vivaciously crowd-pleasing space adventure. Of all of Marvel's many Phase I and Phase II projects tackled, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is, to date, the most alive with imagination and wonder."

guardians-of-the-galaxy,Clayton Davis,False,"Jul 30, 2014",James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy is the best Marvel movie yet. I challenge anyone who would place Iron Man or The Avengers over this action-packed and thoroughly entertaining picture that is the definitive summer blockbuster.

guardians-of-the-galaxy,Will Leitch,False,"Jul 30, 2014",Turning Andy Dwyer into an action-movie star turns out a brilliant move: His earnestness and doltish cheer makes it impossible not to cheer for him and sets a certain zonked tone that keeps everything grounded even when the plot is zipping all over.
guardians-of-the-galaxy,Claudia Puig,False,"Jul 30, 2014","The plot occasionally becomes overstuffed, perhaps packing in extraneous elements in order to set up future installments. Yet the zany script by director James Gunn and co-writer Nicole Perlman is sharply funny."
guardians-of-the-galaxy,Matt Donato,False,"Jul 30, 2014",Iron What? Captain Who? The Guardians of the Galaxy are here to stay thanks to a Troma-bred filmmaker crazy enough to make the movie that such a fantastical comic deserves.

guardians-of-the-galaxy,Jason Gorber,False,"Jul 29, 2014","By its very construction Guardians of the Galaxy is trying to both be smug and self-aware, but also heroic and adventurous. For the most part the film manages to pull off this balance, making for a fun and many ways laudable film."

guardians-of-the-galaxy,Marc Mohan,False,"Jul 29, 2014","Demonstrates that you don't need to rely on name-brand do-gooders to make rousing, funny, even endearing entertainment.

guardians-of-the-galaxy,Blake Howard,False,"Jul 28, 2014","Guardians of the Galaxy is the unranked underdog that stepped in the arena with the best comic book films ever made, and walked out of the ring with the belt."

iron-man-2,Aaron Asadi,True,"Jul 7, 2015","It too frequently seems that Iron Man's battles could simply be replaced with a scene featuring Stark and his opponent measuring their respective suit's RAM, with a glance towards their supporting company's share prices."
iron-man-2,Will Leitch,True,"Jun 22, 2013",It's much more fun to create a franchise than to doggedly sustain it.
iron-man-2,Jeffrey Lyles,False,"May 2, 2013","Throws down the armored gauntlet to all the other summer blockbusters - bring your ""A"" game or be content being the season's second best movie."
iron-man-2,Mark Adams,False,"Apr 15, 2013","Robert Downey Jr., plays Stark with a twinkle in his eye and a sense of fun, but can't quite stamp the same authority onto the film as he did in the first version."
iron-man-2,Chris Garcia,True,"Apr 15, 2013",It's half the fun of the first movie and twice as convoluted.
iron-man-2,Nick Pinkerton,True,"Apr 15, 2013","As for the actual grand finale, Downey Jr. and Cheadle seem like they're already network gaming the PS3 release instead of facing any actual threat, and Rourke goes out like a chump."
iron-man-2,Tom Charity,True,"Apr 15, 2013",The whiz-bang stuff here -- while never less than slick -- doesn't produce anything we haven't seen before.
iron-man-2,Jason Buchanan,False,"Apr 15, 2013","Despite being more traditional in structure and theme than the original, Iron Man 2 offers just about everything anyone could ask for in a superhero spectacular, and then some."
iron-man-2,Michael Saba,True,"Apr 14, 2013","The most cynical and calculating part of it all is that the movie never really finds a justification for its existence; except, that is, as a bald-faced setup for The Avengers."
iron-man-2,Jeff Beck,False,"Oct 1, 2012","Many people will probably not find this one up to par with the fun of the original, but personally, I ended up having more fun with this movie, so while I gave the original a mild recommendation, I can give this one a slightly stronger one."
iron-man-2,Adam Ross,False,"Sep 29, 2012",I was predisposed to like Iron Man even if it starred David Hasselhoff wrapped in tinfoil ... Is it worth your time? Definitely. Is it the calibre of Spider-Man 2 and The Dark Knight? Afraid not.
iron-man-2,Ali Gray,False,"Sep 28, 2012","By rights, a superhero sequel should be darker, more intense and more dangerous, but Favreau is happy just to stay cool. That's all Iron Man's job has ever been, and frankly, that's fine by me."
iron-man-2,Greg Maki,False,"Nov 5, 2011",The bar has been set for the 2010 summer blockbusters.
iron-man-2,Ed Whitfield,True,"Jun 30, 2011","... The visual effects, though solid, may brighten the screen but are a poor substitute for characterisation and style - those two absent friends who we miss the most during the show."
iron-man-2,Dave White,False,"Apr 4, 2011","In the land of sequels it's no Temple of Doom or Empire Strikes Back, but it's also not Rise of the Silver Surfer. Me and my box of Junior Mints, we still had a good time."
iron-man-2,Joshua Starnes,False,"Mar 27, 2011","Iron Man 2 isn't an ideal sequel but it is good, fixing most of the problems of the first movie without giving up what made it work to begin with."
iron-man-2,Mike Edwards,False,"Feb 3, 2011",Some critics may claim that the Iron Man films are simply dragging on a genre that's redundant (...) but my view is that it is rescuing a big part of the Marvel universe.
iron-man-2,Jason Best,False,"Dec 29, 2010",Robert Downey Jr squeezes back into ... Tony Stark's incredible suit ... and his charismatic presence gives the movie a bigger boost than his character's jet-propelled boots.
iron-man-2,Simon Miraudo,False,"Oct 21, 2010","Iron Man bests the biggest adversaries of the superhero genre in his second outing: production troubles, sequel-bloat and overwhelming, unrestrained fanboy hype."
iron-man-2,Matt Neal,True,"Oct 9, 2010","Fans will be satisfied, even if it doesn't match the nuanced and well-rounded brilliance of the first film. But many will be disappointed with this seemingly rushed follow-up."
iron-man-2,John J. Puccio,False,"Sep 23, 2010","...the movie offers an abundance of thrills, laughs, and interpersonal communications. Yeah, action and talk; a little something for everyone."
iron-man-2,Ian Buckwalter,False,"Jul 18, 2010","In the quest to do things bigger, louder, and faster than its predecessor, excess can get a little... excessive. But this is still miles ahead of the average summer festival of fireballs, owing in large part to the great ensemble and snappy dialogue."
iron-man-2,Matthew Pejkovic,False,"Jul 6, 2010",The repercussions of superhero life and the weight of family legacy take centre stage in this busy yet charismatic superhero melodrama.
iron-man-2,Rafer Guzman,False,"Jul 6, 2010","The best scenes are still the ones with Downey and Gwyneth Paltrow (as Stark's charm-resistant assistant, Pepper Potts), or just Downey alone."
iron-man-2,Laremy Legel,False,"Jul 6, 2010",It's enjoyable to see a quality superhero dynamically and enthusiastically rendered.
iron-man-2,Kamal  'The Diva' Larsuel,False,"Jul 6, 2010",Still worth watching. Just set your bar a little lower.
iron-man-2,Cosmo Landesman,True,"Jul 6, 2010","There's an outdated feel to it all, from its cold-war view of America to the AC/DC soundtrack."
iron-man-2,Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat,False,"Jul 6, 2010",Snappy and fast-paced.
iron-man-2,Fernando F. Croce,True,"Jul 6, 2010","Crasser, noisier, more metallic"
iron-man-2,Bruce Bennett,False,"Jun 28, 2010",Suffers from a bit of sequel-itis..but don't look for what it isn't; enjoy the solid filmmaking and actors who take their comic book-created roles very seriously.
iron-man-2,Jeremy Heilman,True,"Jun 18, 2010",All of the charm and romance of the original has been ironed out by excess.
iron-man-2,Stephen Himes,True,"Jun 10, 2010","Tony Stark is Dick Cheney's foreign policy driven by Grover Norquist's fiscal policy, sold to the public by Ari Gold. Very confusing."
iron-man-2,Sean Burns,True,"Jun 2, 2010",You won't find a more overqualified cast this year. Then out come the CGI effects and everything becomes a yawn.
iron-man-2,Radheyan Simonpillai,False,"May 29, 2010",Iron Man 2 suffers from typical sequelitis. It bites off more than it can chew and feels drowsy as a result.
iron-man-2,David Nusair,False,"May 23, 2010",A mild improvement over its lackluster predecessor...
iron-man-2,Wesley Lovell,True,"May 22, 2010",Sometimes simple is better. The original thrived on few integral characters and a world-wise approach to storytelling. This feature seems to think action is more important than story and an overabundance of characters is a necessity.
iron-man-2,Jonathan Kiefer,False,"May 20, 2010","Don Cheadle, Samuel L. Jackson, Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell and again Gwyneth Paltrow are gladly on hand, but only Robert Downey Jr. can so comfortably guide us through the conspicuous outlay."
iron-man-2,David Cornelius,True,"May 19, 2010","Take all twelve plots, set your iPod on shuffle, and watch as the franchise deteriorates into a shallow pool of half-baked ideas and detached snark."
iron-man-2,Jules Brenner,False,"May 18, 2010","Downey's Stark was a human hero. But the dude in ""Iron Man 2"" has gone superhero and the synthetic construction doesn't offer the same fullness of character it once did. Still..."
iron-man-2,Bob Grimm,False,"May 18, 2010",Downey Jr. makes it all worthwhile.
iron-man-2,Stephen Silver,False,"May 17, 2010","Recognizes and repeats a lot of the things that made the original great, but also falls victim to many of the pitfalls of past superhero sequels."
iron-man-2,Christopher Smith,True,"May 16, 2010","The over-hyped Jon Favreau movie, ""Iron Man 2,"" is a downer and a disappointment, especially when compared to the entertaining first movie that came before it."
iron-man-2,Philip Martin,True,"May 15, 2010","I cannot imagine that anyone intimately involved with the making of Iron Man 2 would ever, on their own dime and their own time, ever go to see a movie like Iron Man 2."
iron-man-2,Paul Chambers,False,"May 14, 2010","Not a bad followup to the original Iron Man. Good performances and plenty of first-rate action. Iron Man 2 is great fun. Paul Chambers, CNN."
iron-man-2,Peter Rainer,False,"May 14, 2010","Rourke puts a human face, albeit a bashed one, on comic book villainy."
iron-man-2,James Kendrick,False,"May 14, 2010","successfully fits the summer blockbuster mold, but holds out just enough surprises to make it a worthwhile diversion"
iron-man-2,John Beifuss,False,"May 14, 2010","Fails to resolve the fascist implications of Stark's claim to have 'privatized world peace'; here, Stark's human and machine sides correlate to Klaatu and Gort in 'The Day the Earth Stood Still,' who demanded the world accept a robot police force..."
iron-man-2,Andrew Hedley,False,"May 13, 2010","Fans of the comic book might well be satisfied. Anyone else will find moments here - it certainly looks cool - but might, like me, leave the cinema feeling a little undernourished."
iron-man-2,Clay Cane,True,"May 13, 2010","Aesthetically, 'Iron Man 2' is a polished flick. Plot wise, it's almost as bad as 'Catwoman.'"
iron-man-2,Charles Koplinski,False,"May 12, 2010",Rusty first act can't slow Iron Man 2.
iron-man-2,Fr. Chris Carpenter,False,"May 12, 2010","An improvement in almost every way (over the first film), most notably in a better, more serious screenplay."
iron-man-2,Rick Kisonak,False,"May 12, 2010","Favreau throws in everything but the kitchen sink in his desperate effort to meet stratospheric expectations, and the result is too much of a so-so thing."
iron-man-2,Armond White,True,"May 12, 2010","Iron Man 2 is exactly what critics and audiences deserve following the celebration of that awful, dung-hued first film."
iron-man-2,Cynthia Fuchs,True,"May 12, 2010","Iron Man 2 careens between self-awareness and self-promotion, which is not to say these are opposite conditions."
iron-man-2,Ken Hanke,False,"May 12, 2010","That rarest of the rara avis, a sequel that's better than the original."
iron-man-2,Sara Michelle Fetters,True,"May 11, 2010","Like the original this is a movie I don't particularly mind but don't exactly love, either."
iron-man-2,Richard Knight,False,"May 11, 2010",There's enough Downey and copious amounts of attendant razzle dazzle in this overstuffed sequel to make for a cautious recommendation.
iron-man-2,Jeffrey Chen,False,"May 11, 2010","Bent on escapism and content to stay on the surface of the issues it presents, it at least does its best to give that surface a pleasing, gleaming polish."
iron-man-2,Robert Roten,False,"May 11, 2010","Typical popcorn film, except for the huge budget."
iron-man-2,Kelly Vance,False,"May 11, 2010","Such a visual grabber, with so much unexpected food for thought, that it's hard to see how it could be topped."
iron-man-2,Eric Melin,False,"May 10, 2010","What's missing is any real sense of danger...Is Iron Man 2 as solid as its predecessor? No, but it's still nice to spend some time with some old friends."
iron-man-2,Andrea Chase,False,"May 10, 2010","a cracking good tale of good, evil, large egos, small mercies, and the fate of the world. Of course."
iron-man-2,Jackie K. Cooper,False,"May 10, 2010",Iron Man becomes the Tin Man because this sequel has lost its heart. Luckily the special effects and Downey's charm save the day.
iron-man-2,Frank Lovece,False,"May 10, 2010","In a refreshing and unexpected turn, the sequel to Iron Man doesn't find a changed man. Inside the metal, imperfect humanity grows even more so, as thought-provoking questions of identity meet techno-fantasy made flesh."
iron-man-2,Tony Macklin,True,"May 10, 2010",Iron Man 2 could be Chaplin Meets The Wrestler Meets Shakespeare in Love Meets Stan Lee. Instead it's more The Stooges Meet Sara Lee.
iron-man-2,Dan Lybarger,False,"May 10, 2010",Probably the most refreshing trait in Jon Favreau's Iron Man movies is that the most entertaining moments come when there's no action to speak of.
iron-man-2,Dragan Antulov,False,"May 10, 2010","Film predstavlja predobru kombinaciju akcije, drame i humora da bi ga se otpisalo kao rutinersko holivudsko eksploatiranje devete umjetnosti"
iron-man-2,Dennis Schwartz,True,"May 9, 2010",Pales beside the original.
iron-man-2,Kevin A. Ranson,False,"May 9, 2010",... there's no doubt that Robert Downey Jr. continues to own and entertain in the part he's spent a lifetime preparing for.
iron-man-2,Linda Cook,False,"May 9, 2010","Because we already know how Iron Man came to be, 'Iron Man 2' isn't quite as interesting as the first film. But it does pack a super-hero wallop of action and fun."
iron-man-2,Boo Allen,True,"May 9, 2010",Entertaining enough but falls short of delivering much of anything new.
iron-man-2,Jeff Bayer,False,"May 9, 2010","Lots of sizzle, no real stakes. The movie is at its best when it's just Tony Stark hanging out."
iron-man-2,Kit Bowen,False,"May 8, 2010","It'd be difficult for any additional Iron Man incarnation to surpass the original, but Iron Man 2 is a worthy follow-up."
iron-man-2,Diana Saenger,False,"May 8, 2010",Whether playing Charlie Chaplin or a billionaire with superhero armor; Downy will pull us in every time.
iron-man-2,Emanuel Levy,False,"May 8, 2010","Relying heavily on CGI and action set-pieces, the sequel lacks an engaging plot and good actors (Jackson, Cheadle, Paltrow) are underused, but it offers fast-paced, glossy, polished entertainment like a quick joy ride in Disneyland."
iron-man-2,Mike McGranaghan,False,"May 8, 2010","While the plot is not as tight as it could be, Iron Man 2 still delivers in every other way."
iron-man-2,Betty Jo Tucker,False,"May 8, 2010","Contains enough great action sequences, impressive special effects and splendid performances to hold your interest most of the time. Excellent way to start summer movie season."
iron-man-2,Michael Smith,False,"May 8, 2010","It has more characters, more stuff blown to bits, more of everything. It's a condition common to sequels, and it can be both a good and bad thing, but this is still great fun."
iron-man-2,Rob Gonsalves,True,"May 8, 2010","We've had to wait this long for Rourke and Downey to share the screen, and when they finally do, they're turned into action figures."
iron-man-2,Michelle Alexandria,True,"May 8, 2010",Its a collection of scenes where stuff happens but not a real movie. The first Iron Man proved it could be smart AND entertaining. This is just mildly ok in parts.
iron-man-2,Tim Brayton,False,"May 7, 2010","Where Iron Man was champagne, Iron Man 2 is Asti."
iron-man-2,Widgett Walls,False,"May 7, 2010",You're not getting the Marvel equivalent of Dark Knight. You're getting Robert Downey Jr. having a blast and wanting you to have a blast too.
iron-man-2,Steve Crum,False,"May 7, 2010","Once you get past accepting comedian Garry Shandling as U.S. Senator Stern (hey, he's a comic in a comic book movie), 'Iron Man 2' kicks in, turbos upward and fuses on into one spectacular action tale."
iron-man-2,Steve Biodrowski,False,"May 7, 2010",Iron Man 2's dubious politlca stance...muddles what could have made a good sequel even better.
iron-man-2,Matt Brunson,False,"May 7, 2010","Iron Man 2 doesn't quite degenerate into a Transformers 3 ... [it's] recommended, but with major reservations."
iron-man-2,Nell Minow,False,"May 7, 2010",Those who wait through all of the credits will get a glimpse of what is in store for the next superhero saga. I hope between now and then they remember that less is more.
iron-man-2,Kevin Carr,False,"May 7, 2010","I enjoyed Iron Man 2 for the popcorn spectacle is was, and I had at least as much fun as it appeared Robert Downey Jr. and Jon Favreau had making it."
iron-man-2,Adam Tobias,False,"May 7, 2010","It's hard to imagine what the Iron Man franchise would be like without the great Downey Jr. That's something I never want to think about, and luckily, we don't have to."
iron-man-2,Jen Yamato,False,"May 7, 2010","If you're just going to see men in robot suits blow each other up while classic rock blares on the soundtrack, Iron Man 2 will do just fine..."
iron-man-2,Roger Tennis,False,"May 7, 2010","""Iron Man 2"" rocks!, with no signs of rust in the series' armor."

iron-man-2,Lori Hoffman,False,"May 7, 2010","... an acceptable action flick that creates a stiff wind but never achieves ""blow-you-away"" status."
iron-man-2,Kevin Williamson,False,"May 7, 2010","Again, its leading man remains the most compelling component of this franchise."
iron-man-2,Cole Smithey,False,"May 7, 2010","...there's plenty of eye-popping action, snappy one-liners, and Robert Downey Jr. working at the top of his game..."
iron-man-2,Christopher Orr,False,"May 7, 2010",Even the director...seems to view the heavy clanking of mechanized men as a bit of a chore: the kind of well-prepared yet unremarkable meat course that must inevitably follow the delightful amuse bouche of Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Stark.
iron-man-2,Lisa Kennedy,False,"May 7, 2010",Superhero Stark remains intriguing.
iron-man-2,Adam Fendelman,False,"May 7, 2010",Iron Man 2 does what it can within the confines of what it has to do. The Hollywood machine has trained us to have certain expectations for blockbuster sequels and this film neither deviates nor blazes new territory.
iron-man-2,Sandie Angulo Chen,False,"May 7, 2010","Downey whips out the big guns, sexy banter in fun sequel."
iron-man-2,Garth Franklin,False,"May 7, 2010",A problematic yet still quite entertaining sequel
iron-man-2,Josh Hurst,False,"May 7, 2010","The best part of Iron Man 2 is Gwyneth Paltrow, and not just because of her energy and wit, or even her chemistry with the leading man. She's also the film's beating heart."
iron-man-2,Matt Soergel,True,"May 7, 2010",Entertaining ... but long stretches of the movie are more fizzle than sizzle.

iron-man-2,Jeffrey M. Anderson,False,"May 7, 2010","It concentrates on being lighter, more fleet-footed and more consistent than its predecessor."
iron-man-2,Robert Levin,True,"May 7, 2010",The inevitable Iron Man 3 needs a better screenplay than this.
iron-man-2,Gary Wolcott,False,"May 7, 2010","Iron Man 2 rocks. It does so literally and loudly, thanks to lots of licks interspersed through the soundtrack from metal mavens AC/DC. No slow spots. No sequel let down."
iron-man-2,Margaret Pomeranz,False,"May 7, 2010","This may not be quite as good as the original, it doesn't actually need to be over two hours long, you could avoid the sag in the middle with judicious editing of the screenplay by Justin Theroux. But there's still a lot of joy to be had here."
iron-man-2,Kimberly Gadette,False,"May 7, 2010","It's not that story conflicts aren't desired but here, with so many problems -- some more implausible than others -- this Iron Man becomes a victim of its own heavy metal. Yet Downey still soars."
iron-man-2,Kurt Loder,True,"May 7, 2010",We soon realize that fight scenes involving faceless actors in big titanium battle suits sound like nothing so much as a multi-kettle kitchen accident.
iron-man-2,Peter Sobczynski,True,"May 7, 2010",This one may provide some temporary thrills but they are empty ones that will largely be forgotten within a couple of days.
iron-man-2,Bill Gibron,False,"May 7, 2010","This is the very definition of slam-bang entertainment, beating one over the head with as much potential amusement as possible until they surrender with a stunned if satisfied popcorn smile."
iron-man-2,Randy Myers,False,"May 7, 2010",It's a solid blockbuster with a few faults that you just don't mind overlooking.
iron-man-2,Brian Orndorf,False,"May 7, 2010","Even in the face of this dazzling ensemble and deeper budgetary pockets, Favreau keeps his wits about him, embarking on a snappy second round agreeably mindful of what clicked before."
iron-man-2,Janos Gereben,False,"May 7, 2010","This sequel was an improvement in many ways. I preferred Don Cheadle as Tony's friend Rhodey, the two seemed to have a better rapport, and Mickey Rourke just can't be beat as a villain"
iron-man-2,Brandon Fibbs,False,"May 7, 2010","Like so many sequels based on a rich and abundant source material with rabid fanboys to please, Iron Man 2 bites off a bit more than it can convincingly chew."
iron-man-2,Chris Hewitt,False,"May 7, 2010","The movie is fun, but not as much fun as it could be because it feels like it's so busy enjoying its own cleverness it doesn't even need an audience."
iron-man-2,David Foucher,False,"May 7, 2010","It's a rush, but it's more like taxiing than take-off."

iron-man-2,Scott Weinberg,False,"May 7, 2010","It's still impressive enough for a flick to be called ""a worthwhile sequel to a superior film,"" and Iron Man 2 is certainly that."
iron-man-2,Diva Velez,False,"May 7, 2010","At its best when its personality is showing, the brilliant Iron Man's sequel hasn't as much on display. Still, top-flight special effects action and sparky comic riffing from Downey, Jr. and Rockwell make up for many inadequacies."
iron-man-2,MaryAnn Johanson,False,"May 7, 2010","[T]he movie's fluff-headed ignorance of its own self is so merry that it's almost impossible to get upset about it. Downey's Stark may no longer be surprising, but he's still a helluva lotta fun to hang out with for two hours..."
iron-man-2,Keith Cohen,False,"May 6, 2010","Downey seems to have found a comfort zone, and his enjoyment combined with a charismatic personality transcends the screen. Eye candy is dished out with the attractive sexiness of Paltrow and Johansson, who joust for affectionate testosterone-fueled respo"
iron-man-2,Peter Canavese,False,"May 6, 2010","Showmanship is the order of the day for superhero sequel Iron Man 2, though the flash and dazzle distract from plot machinery that's more than a little clunky."

iron-man-2,Daniel M. Kimmel,False,"May 6, 2010",The first Iron Man was a wonderful surprise... [I]n many ways this movie seems like the morning after.
iron-man-2,Richard Roeper,False,"May 6, 2010","Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man? OK, pretty good. Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark? Brilliant."
iron-man-2,Avi Offer,False,"May 6, 2010","Offers fewer surprises and exhilarating scenes than its smarter predecessor, briefly loses its footing, and suffers from excessive contrivance, but remains mindlessly entertaining thanks to its solid cast and some thrilling action sequences."
iron-man-2,Eric D. Snider,False,"May 6, 2010","What happens in between [the few action sequences] is droll and lively, thanks mostly to Downey and Rockwell's typically colorful performances; it just isn't very super, you know?"
iron-man-2,Shawn Levy,False,"May 6, 2010","The filmmakers haven't quite bled Iron Man of his appeal, they haven't dented him or let him rust, but they've done precious little to polish him, either. The shine is still there, but just barely."
iron-man-2,Luke Y. Thompson,False,"May 6, 2010","Yes, sometimes there's a bit too much story at the expense of the action. But when was the last time you had that complaint about a big event movie?"
iron-man-2,Dana Stevens,True,"May 6, 2010",Casting the likes of Downey and Rourke and then imprisoning them in jointed refrigerators is resource-squandering of the highest order.
iron-man-2,J. R. Jones,True,"May 6, 2010","The movie settles into a series of ho-hum conflicts and complications, and the requisite slam-bang ending is perfunctory at best."
iron-man-2,Philip Booth,False,"May 6, 2010","Frantic, place-holding sequel? Check. Third installment guaranteed? Check."
iron-man-2,John Griffin,False,"May 6, 2010",It's the first summer movie of 2010. Let the expensive silliness begin.

iron-man-2,Michael A. Smith,False,"May 6, 2010","Faster and louder than the first film, ""Iron Man 2"" is a fanboy's dream come true."
iron-man-2,Robert W. Butler,False,"May 6, 2010",I'd have told even non-comic book fans to see the original Iron Man. I'd recommend this sequel mostly to the initiated... which probably accounts for 80 percent of all moviegoers.
iron-man-2,Richard Corliss,True,"May 6, 2010","[Downey] gives Iron Man 2 its fascination. The rest is a cluttered, clattering toy story."
iron-man-2,Joe Morgenstern,True,"May 6, 2010","This sequel, alas, settles for old elements in a new alloy -- less iron, lots more lead and tin."
iron-man-2,Steven D. Greydanus,False,"May 6, 2010",Hammer and Vanko's uneasy dance rivals Tony and Pepper's banter for Iron Man 2's funniest couple … The screwball vibe is even more pronounced … with wittier dialogue and even more deadpan delivery.
iron-man-2,Devin Faraci,False,"May 6, 2010","Superman has Kryptonite. Green Lantern is powerless against the color yellow. And if Iron Man 2 is any indication, Tony Stark's big weakness could be scripts."
iron-man-2,Brian Tallerico,False,"May 6, 2010",A summer blockbuster that's interesting without ever being riveting; entertaining without ever being thrilling. Summer 2010 has started with a piece of popcorn entertainment that just happens to taste like it was popped in 2008.
iron-man-2,Laura Clifford,False,"May 6, 2010",The surprisingly funny script from actor Justin Theroux gives Stark a new reason to reassess himself while also providing some terrific banter for Stark and Pepper's simmering sublimation.

iron-man-2,Carrie Rickey,False,"May 6, 2010","Favreau's a workmanlike filmmaker who gets virtuoso performances from his leads, particularly Paltrow and Cheadle, but most of all Downey."
iron-man-2,Gary Thompson,False,"May 6, 2010","The franchise's bounce and lightness make it unique among recent comic book adaptations, which have leaned increasingly toward heavy, dreary themes they don't have the dramatic weight to support."
iron-man-2,Jeff Vice,False,"May 6, 2010","It's a funny, exciting and even deceptively smart action-thriller with a few things to say about use of technology for destructive purposes."
iron-man-2,Nick Starkey,False,"May 6, 2010","Like the original, Iron Man 2 is a good time from start to finish."
iron-man-2,Claudia Puig,False,"May 6, 2010","The action sequences are fun, though not as exhilarating as in the 2008 original, and the dialogue can be zingy."
iron-man-2,Moira MacDonald,False,"May 6, 2010","Downey still has plenty of moments of charm (nobody kicks a car aside as casually as this guy), and most of the action sequences are lively and fun."

iron-man-2,Clint O'Connor,False,"May 6, 2010","Not as clever or thrilling as No. 1 (or as well-written/ad-libbed), but there's still good tongue-in-cheek fun thanks to Downey and his cohorts."
iron-man-2,Joshua Tyler,False,"May 6, 2010","It's easy to talk about what Iron Man 2 doesn't do, but what it does do is so full of energy and genuine enthusiasm that it's hard to imagine anyone walking out unhappy."
iron-man-2,James Rocchi,True,"May 6, 2010","While the title is ""Iron Man 2,"" what we're being given is ""Iron Man Squared."" There's too much going on, and all the characters and plots and revelations and foreshadowings do not fill the film but bloat it."
iron-man-2,Susan Granger,False,"May 6, 2010",It's a good - but not great - action-packed popcorn picture.
iron-man-2,Scott Tobias,False,"May 6, 2010","It's a clean, efficient, somewhat generic piece of storytelling and most of the additions are not subtractions. This passes for success in the summer movie season."
iron-man-2,Peter Howell,False,"May 6, 2010","The franchise still has a lot of spark, but next time they need to clean the corrosion off the batteries."

iron-man-2,Willie Waffle,False,"May 6, 2010","My favorite part of Downey's performance is watching him think, which is more fascinating to watch than every Miley Cyrus, Jennifer Lopez and Ashton Kutcher movie combined!"
iron-man-2,Tom Long,False,"May 6, 2010","There are too many new characters, too many crossing story lines, not enough romance and our hero's a smug jerk for the first half hour. Who cares? Iron Man 2 still rocks."

iron-man-2,Liam Lacey,True,"May 6, 2010","Iron Man 2 emerges as a movie that's at war, not between Iron Man and his surfeit of enemies, but between two different movie-making instincts."
iron-man-2,Marc Savlov,True,"May 6, 2010",This mega-mecha melee manages to give short shrift to both the airborne action set-pieces that define Iron Man's zoomy panache and incoming supervillain Whiplash.
iron-man-2,Sean O'Connell,False,"May 6, 2010","it's the tenuous chinks in Stark's personal armor ... as well as Downey's captivatingly honest examinations of his character's inherent flaws, that permit the actor, and not the effects, to carry the drama"
iron-man-2,Ann Hornaday,True,"May 6, 2010","Often playing like it has been jury-rigged from bits and pieces of a longer, smarter movie, Iron Man 2 seems chiefly intended as a placeholder for its next dozen or so sequels."
iron-man-2,Stephanie Zacharek,True,"May 6, 2010","The big problem with Iron Man 2, maybe, is that it so dutifully gives the people what they want, instead of giving them what they didn't know they wanted."
iron-man-2,Andrew Wright,True,"May 6, 2010","Flabby, disjointed, and eschewing conflict for extended scenes of improv clowning, it's the Superheroic equivalent of a Rat Pack film."
iron-man-2,Christy Lemire,True,"May 6, 2010","The substance of the original Iron Man, the brain and the soul that set it apart from the typical seasonal fare and made it one of the best films of 2008, also have been blown to bits."
iron-man-2,Tony Medley,True,"May 6, 2010","Appealing mainly to male special effects fans, this high octane, low intellect thing has only two performances worth watching, by Larry Shandling and Sam Rockwell."

iron-man-2,James Verniere,False,"May 6, 2010","But this go-again, penned by multi-threat Justin Theroux (""Tropic Thunder""), gets a B for bland due to a frequently leaden screenplay, rock-'em-sock-'em mayhem (Is this another ""Transformers"" movie?) and an underwhelming villain (Mickey Rourke), who looks"

iron-man-2,Kevin McCarthy,False,"May 6, 2010",Iron Man 2 is on par with the first film. The flick delivers more action and comedy at the expense of an uneven and overly complicated plot line.
iron-man-2,Jason Zingale,False,"May 6, 2010","The movie could have easily been undone by its own overambition, but Iron Man 2 prevails as the light and fun summer blockbuster we were all expecting."
iron-man-2,Jim Judy,False,"May 6, 2010",Parental Content Review (all the details you need to know)
iron-man-2,Frank Swietek,True,"May 6, 2010","Talky, curiously depressing for most of its running-time, weighed down by too many heroes and an army of uninteresting villains, and messily prosaic in the big action moments, 'Iron Man 2' suggests that this franchise is already running on fumes."
iron-man-2,Erik Childress,True,"May 6, 2010",Why get an actor like Rourke at the peak of his recent comeback and then lock him up to repair drones and type on a keyboard for the second half of the film? Hardly innovation for a film that argues against wasteful spending on hardware.
iron-man-2,Colin Newton,False,"May 6, 2010","At times it is hard to decipher what's what and who's who, and the storyline does venture into boring town, but the explosive action and comic relief make it watchable."

iron-man-2,James Berardinelli,False,"May 6, 2010","[Downey's] innate charisma, his ability to deliver cutting lines of dialogue with the perfect inflection, and his capacity to overcome narrative shortcomings are reasons why Iron Man 2 works better than one might suspect."
iron-man-2,Rene Rodriguez,True,"May 6, 2010","Iron Man 2 is more of a set-up for the upcoming Avengers picture than a stand-alone adventure -- a puzzling and unexpected disappointment, considering how fresh and entertaining the first picture was."
iron-man-2,Josh Bell,False,"May 5, 2010","There's too much superfluity for Iron Man 2 to be a great comic-book movie, but when it's good, it's exactly the kind of summer entertainment people are looking for."
iron-man-2,Ethan Alter,True,"May 5, 2010",Iron Man 2 simply simply isn't as satisfying as its predecessor.
iron-man-2,Lou Lumenick,True,"May 5, 2010","There's so much clunky exposition in the script attributed to Justin Theroux that it seems forever before the first action sequence, which has surprisingly mediocre special effects."
iron-man-2,Joe Neumaier,False,"May 5, 2010","This sequel to the 2008 mega-blockbuster fires on more cylinders than the first film, yet relies on star Robert Downey Jr. more than it does kinetic energy and rock 'em-sock 'em technology (which it has in spades)."
iron-man-2,Victoria Alexander,True,"May 5, 2010","A major disappointment. I hated arrogant, bratty, foot-stomping man-baby Tony Stark and prissy Pepper Potts. Too much brattle and no story."
iron-man-2,Rebecca Murray,False,"May 5, 2010",Iron Man 2 is as good as its predecessor - and in some ways even better.
iron-man-2,Lisa Schwarzbaum,True,"May 5, 2010","Downey's head and heart are in the right place, but the movie is more in pieces than whole, and more about iron than about men."
iron-man-2,Bill Goodykoontz,False,"May 5, 2010","Bigger, louder and dumber than its predecessor, Iron Man 2 is still a lot of fun."
iron-man-2,Prairie Miller,True,"May 5, 2010","Only the first of who knows how many sequels, and those clunky ferrous fashionistas are already getting a little, well, rusty. Downey retains his Chaplinesque eccentric charm, but it's wearing thin, adding up to a sequel with a serious Iron deficiency."
iron-man-2,Michael Phillips,False,"May 5, 2010",What saves it is Favreau's work with the cast.
iron-man-2,Josh Larsen,False,"May 5, 2010",...may mark the beginning of Mickey Rourke's re-descent (cooing to a cockatoo in Russian will do that).
iron-man-2,Roger Ebert,False,"May 5, 2010","Iron Man 2 is a polished, high-ozone sequel, not as good as the original but building once again on a quirky performance by Robert Downey Jr."
iron-man-2,Roger Moore,False,"May 5, 2010","If the morality, the pathos of death, the tenderness of the would-be romance between Tony Stark/Iron Man and his assistant, Pepper Potts, are missing, Iron Man 2 is still a fun ride."
iron-man-2,Luis Martinez,False,"May 5, 2010","En Iron Man 2, el héroe está plagado de problemas humanos, problemas que Tony Stark trata de resolver a base de billetes, cinismo, narcismo, alcohol, mujeres y violencia... lo que le viene fantástico a la cinta."
iron-man-2,Julian Roman,False,"May 5, 2010",It's a shame that Marvel saddled Iron Man 2 with the baggage of other films.
iron-man-2,Steve Persall,True,"May 5, 2010","No matter how against the grain the superhero's origins seemed in Part 1, or how uniquely Robert Downey Jr. played them, a second helping of Iron Man has some ""wow"" issues to work out."
iron-man-2,Nick Schager,True,"May 5, 2010","Upgraded with the latest CGI hardware but also more shoddy screenwriting software than its system can withstand, Iron Man 2 is an example of subtraction by addition."
iron-man-2,Marshall Fine,True,"May 5, 2010","If you listen and read closely, the positive reviews will be cloaking their praise of Iron Man 2 in rationalizations, rather than letting it flow unfettered."
iron-man-2,Joanna Langfield,False,"May 5, 2010","Big, empty and dying: is it Tony Stark or the Iron Man franchise itself? Director Jon Favreau has taken great pains to insure Justin Theroux's script doesn't get bogged down by silly matters like mortality."
iron-man-2,Paul Gallagher,True,"May 5, 2010","A series of carefully-planned, effects-heavy sequences strung together with slapdash storytelling, underdeveloped character ideas and the occasional funny line of dialogue."
iron-man-2,Matt Pais,True,"May 5, 2010","Twice the snark, half the fun. The original's wit and energy shrivel into countless subplots and so little excitement that the sequel barely qualifies as an action movie."
iron-man-2,Joshua Rothkopf,True,"May 5, 2010","Has it finally happened? Hard as it is to type, Robert Downey Jr. may have reached obnoxiousness."

iron-man-2,Nick Pinkerton,True,"May 4, 2010","The idea is that we learn to trust that any extraneous-seeming thread will connect to something in another couple of summers and pay off, assuming the movie does."
iron-man-2,Peter Travers,False,"May 4, 2010",It's the promiscuously talented Downey who adds the grace notes that make Iron Man 2 something to remember.
iron-man-2,Tim Robey,False,"May 3, 2010","Though not as turbo-charged as the original, it's funnier and less politically off-putting."

iron-man-2,Alistair Harkness,True,"May 3, 2010","Iron Man 2 feels less like a proper sequel and more like an extended, very expensive infomercial for Marvel's future superhero movie slate."

iron-man-2,David Edelstein,False,"May 3, 2010",It doesn't come close to the emotional heft of those two rare 2s that outclassed their ones: Superman 2 and Spider-Man 2. But Iron Man 2 hums along quite nicely.

iron-man-2,Pablo Villaça,False,"May 1, 2010","(...) um pouco frustrante que o roteiro sinta a necessidade de tornar o protagonista um pouco mais atormentado nesta continuação, já que o filme realmente ganha vida quando o sujeito se entrega ao narcisismo, à irreverência e ao sarcasmo."
iron-man-2,Kam Williams,False,"Apr 30, 2010","Robert Downey, Jr. reprises his role as the genius, billionaire inventor with a superhero alter ego."
iron-man-2,Julie Rigg,True,"Apr 30, 2010","It's good enough to keep the fans happy, but no more. Nothing I say will deter teenage boys who want to see it, but if you go with them, take ear plugs."
iron-man-2,Erin Free,False,"Apr 30, 2010","Like its predecessor, Iron Man 2 is a fine example of how impressive big budget studio filmmaking can be when it's done right."

iron-man-2,Alex Zane,False,"Apr 30, 2010",It falls short of its predecessor and is therefore a disappointment but what it lacks in grit and darkness it makes up for in fun.

iron-man-2,Richard Edwards,False,"Apr 30, 2010","Despite a rollicking opening half hour that leaves you wondering whether you're about to watch the SF film of the year, the movie is unable to deliver on the promise of its set-up."
iron-man-2,Simon Foster,True,"Apr 29, 2010","All this extra effort drains the inherent sense of what was fun about the original, darkening it with issues and complexities that unnecessarily muddy the crisp, clearly commercial premise."
iron-man-2,Seb Patrick,False,"Apr 29, 2010",The hollow feeling to the whole thing is particularly odd given how right so many of the individual elements feel in and of themselves.
iron-man-2,Roz Laws,False,"Apr 29, 2010",Favreau reassembles his main cast for another witty and exciting romp -- and adds the likes of Mickey Rourke and Scarlett Johansson to increase our viewing pleasure.
iron-man-2,Simon Reynolds,True,"Apr 29, 2010",Iron Man was a rare blockbuster that stayed with you -- the sequel all but evaporates the moment it cuts to black.

iron-man-2,Rich Cline,False,"Apr 29, 2010","It's bigger, louder, funnier, darker and more emotional than before. So much so that you hardly notice how thin and choppy the plot is."
iron-man-2,Rob Vaux,True,"Apr 28, 2010","The original Iron Man left some pretty big shoes to fill, and rather than rise to the challenge, the sequel opts to play it safe."
iron-man-2,Scott A. Mantz,False,"Apr 28, 2010","It's not that Iron Man 2 isn't good. In fact, it's good enough, but it falls short of its predecessor."

iron-man-2,Nick De Semlyen,False,"Apr 27, 2010","Rourke and Rockwell make satisfying, complementary villains, while Downey Jr. delivers again. Shame this sequel feels inessential."
iron-man-2,Anders Wotzke,False,"Apr 27, 2010","Unambitiously [believes] that only way to improve on the original is to add more of everything. More heroes! More villains! More CGI! And more Robert Downey Jr.! Surprisingly, the result isn't all bad."

iron-man-3,Damond Fudge,False,"Jun 30, 2020","Iron Man 3 is pure Iron Man fun in the style we've become accustomed to. Downey, Jr. keeps up the charm, even through all of his snarky comments, while bringing a depth to the scenes concerning his post-Avengers PTSD."

iron-man-3,Emmet Asher-Perrin,False,"Jan 14, 2019","[IM3 features] the psychological damage that most superheroes are denied on film, the type of damage they are more likely to receive than any grave physical injury."
iron-man-3,Kelly Jane Torrance,True,"Dec 19, 2018",What it doesn't offer is much in the way of originality -- or lucidity.
iron-man-3,Colby Bryant,False,"Dec 7, 2018","I liked this film far more than many say they do ... It reinterprets many ... elements, ... (but) I applaud Shane Black for boldly taking the story into interesting territory."
iron-man-3,Frank Ochieng,False,"Nov 17, 2018","For the most part, Iron Man 3 is effectively realized courtesy of the eccentric glibness of Downey's colorful turn as the confrontational planet-saving, chrome-plated cad."
iron-man-3,Zaki Hasan,False,"Nov 2, 2018","Iron Man 3 needed to keep the lights on as Marvel set about changing the scenery for ""Phase 2,"" and on that score it succeeds satisfactorily, if not spectacularly."
iron-man-3,Jennifer Heaton,False,"Nov 1, 2018","It tops its predecessors by not actively trying to, and focuses on what actually makes these movies so great in the first place ..."
iron-man-3,Sarah Gopaul,False,"Oct 24, 2018","The villains of this movie comprise a small army, though their numbers aren't as important as their abilities. But even as they appear unstoppable, their evil plot grows more complex and, at least in one instance, more ridiculous."
iron-man-3,Aaron Peterson,False,"Oct 10, 2018","While I may not think every aspect works, you cannot help but be impressed that they did not take the easy way out."
iron-man-3,Pat Padua,True,"Aug 30, 2018","Small-town scenes are the movie's best, and come closest to finding the elusive human connection that the series lacks."
iron-man-3,Leona Laurie,False,"Aug 29, 2018","Good, but Pepper Potts deserves so much more."
iron-man-3,Andre Meadows,False,"Mar 5, 2018","I'm all for quirky comedy in an action film, but there were moments in this movie where things were happening that were pretty dangerous, and people are making whacky jokes."
iron-man-3,Josh Terry,False,"Nov 29, 2017","Iron Man 3 may not feel as incomplete as a Gene Simmons solo record, but it does leave you wishing the rest of the band had come along for the ride."
iron-man-3,Fico Cangiano,False,"Nov 12, 2017",The best entry of the trilogy. Downey Jr. is once again sensational. [Full review in Spanish]
iron-man-3,Matthew Bond,False,"Oct 31, 2017",See the 2D version if you can and enjoy a commercial film that is certainly good -- but some way short of great.
iron-man-3,Sarah Marrs,False,"Oct 21, 2017","Like The Avengers, Iron Man 3 overcomes what logical flaws it has with sheer, unadulterated awesomeness..."
iron-man-3,Candice Frederick,False,"Sep 7, 2017",The movie does exactly what a blockbuster should--entertain.
iron-man-3,Larushka Ivan-Zadeh,False,"Sep 5, 2017",Better than Iron Man 2.
iron-man-3,Matt Goldberg,False,"Jan 6, 2017","In an attempt to bring Tony Stark back to basics, his latest outing is a strangely bloated affair that still manages to be an incredibly fun thanks to the hilarious comedy and exhilarating action."
iron-man-3,Tom Meek,True,"Jul 18, 2016","IM3 is sure to sate its fan base, but it won't endear a new crowd."
iron-man-3,Sonny Bunch,False,"Jul 14, 2016",The Iron Man films are so much better when Iron Man isn't onscreen.
iron-man-3,Jason Bailey,False,"Jun 21, 2016","Beyond all the explosions and action set pieces and 3D wizardry, you can still hear a writer with a distinctive, entertaining voice."
iron-man-3,Mark Jackson,False,"Jun 20, 2016","The third installment of 'Iron Man', while breezy and fun, doesn't really deliver on the fun of flying like the first one did, nor much of anything else, really. But so what?!"
iron-man-3,Giovanni Fazio,False,"Jun 15, 2016","The latest Iron Man has everything you'd expect from a movie with ""3"" in its title: more fireballs, badder bad guys and a gazillion battle-armor suits. But it's also much, much funnier, thanks perhaps to the presence of director Shane Black."
iron-man-3,Kong Rithdee,False,"May 10, 2016","Iron Man 3 is genuine good fun. Nothing to swoon about, but it's satisfactorily entertaining from beginning to end."
iron-man-3,J. Olson,False,"Apr 14, 2016",A picture of absolute infectiousness - and a nearly perfect piece of summer entertainment.
iron-man-3,James Plath,False,"Mar 30, 2016","Iron Man 3 soars above first sequel and might even rival the 2008 debut for overall entertainment value. You laugh, you sit on the edge of your seat, and you marvel (yes, Marvel) at some of the visual effects."
iron-man-3,Rob Gonsalves,False,"Jul 15, 2015","All in fun, the clatter and concussion of action tropes as syncopated as the dialogue."
iron-man-3,Kim Newman,False,"Jul 13, 2015","With Jon Favreau, director of the previous Iron Man films, still around in his sidekick role as Happy Hogan, continuity is maintained, but Black does bring his own, mostly comic chops to the saga."
iron-man-3,Sean Burns,False,"May 12, 2015","A smirky, sardonic sensibility smuggled in by Shane Black is almost enough to cure these summertime blues."
iron-man-3,Chris Stuckmann,False,"Apr 23, 2015","While Iron Man 3 is a huge improvement over the second installment, certain story elements that rip the comics to shreds will anger many fans."

iron-man-3,Mick LaSalle,True,"Dec 17, 2013","Iron Man 3 has good things in it, enough to please the series' fans -- and yet too many drawbacks to win many converts."
iron-man-3,Rob Hunter,True,"Dec 17, 2013",Iron Man 3 is an decent movie that really should have been far better with this pedigree.
iron-man-3,Geoffrey Macnab,False,"Dec 17, 2013",Downey is a brilliant actor who somehow manages to portray Tony Stark as traumatised without losing the character's laidback and comedic quality.
iron-man-3,Seth Kubersky,False,"Dec 17, 2013","Writer/director Shane Black... brings sharp snarky humor and some welcome psychological depth to the Iron Man franchise, which faded in an exhausting second installment after the exhilarating original."

iron-man-3,John Gholson,False,"Aug 12, 2013","Marvel Studios lets director Black off the leash for this third installment, and while the result is edgier, sexier, and more dangerous than what has come before, you may not recognize Tony Stark as the man from the long-running comic."

iron-man-3,Brian Gibson,False,"Jul 11, 2013","It's Iron Man 3's sneaky expos of superhero cool--on the outside, a wisecracking warrior; on the inside, an anxiety-attacked guy who tries to insulate himself with arrogance--that brings this blockbuster down to sympathetic size."
iron-man-3,David Nusair,False,"Jul 7, 2013","There's little doubt that Iron Man Three, in its early stages, fares a whole lot better than one might've anticipated..."
iron-man-3,Wesley Lovell,False,"Jun 18, 2013","A generous step up from its predecessor, the various twists aren't exactly as expected, but you'll still have fun getting there."

iron-man-3,Robert Denerstein,True,"May 26, 2013","The finale is explosive, but Iron Man has some rusty patches too"
iron-man-3,Sean P. Means,False,"May 23, 2013",The way Black surrenders the movie's edginess to the generic onslaught of flashy visuals is a mild disappointment.
iron-man-3,Matthew Pejkovic,True,"May 23, 2013","A regression in the usual strong work from Marvel Studios, Iron Man 3 suffers from director Shane Black's mishandling of this popular superhero character."
iron-man-3,Margot Harrison,False,"May 22, 2013",The elements that were once daring are starting to feel statistically approved - and tired.

iron-man-3,Glenn Lovell,False,"May 18, 2013","... best Iron Man yet thanks to Shane Black, who pushes characterization, clever plot twists, not computer effects ... Downey, for a change, drops his guard, shows the heart beneath the armor"

iron-man-3,Brian Henry Martin,True,"May 16, 2013","Are you sick of superheroes? No, of course you are not, cinema audiences are lapping up any caped crusader movies. But I am, especially when Tony Stark is an angst ridden shambles suffering from performance anxiety. What's so super about that?"

iron-man-3,Al Alexander,True,"May 13, 2013",It's nothing but a collection of superhero clichs made marginally palatable by Robert Downey Jr.'s endless charm and charisma.
iron-man-3,Garth Franklin,False,"May 12, 2013",The real enjoyment here comes when Shane Black's sensibilities take over during the middle hour.
iron-man-3,James Kendrick,False,"May 11, 2013","what it does it does quite well, providing a satisfying sense of escapism while reminding us that such pleasures don't have to be saturated with overkill and completely devoid of relevance"
iron-man-3,Jules Brenner,False,"May 10, 2013","Black and Downey put a swell spin of wit into it and, in a time of superhero saturation, take a back seat to no one in reserving marquee space for their guy. Moreover, they leave you wanting more of the same, please."

iron-man-3,Boo Allen,True,"May 9, 2013",Same old tired effects to go along with more Downey smugness.
iron-man-3,Neil Pond,False,"May 8, 2013","Here, it's not the suit that makes the man; it's the man that makes the suit. And Downey is still the star that keeps it-and this multi-million-dollar movie franchise-roaring and soaring."
iron-man-3,Ken Hanke,True,"May 8, 2013","A lumbering half-assed attempt at self-seriousness with lots of stuff blowing up, a smattering of repartee, one excellent sequence, and a brace of uninteresting villains."
iron-man-3,Clint O'Connor,False,"May 8, 2013",Iron Man 3 provides loads of high-flying fun thanks to the immense charisma of the quick-quipping Robert Downey Jr.
iron-man-3,Jackie K. Cooper,False,"May 8, 2013","Not the best of the three but Robert Downey, Jr. is better than ever."
iron-man-3,Eric Melin,False,"May 8, 2013","In the midst of various plot threads with varying degrees of contemporary relevance, Black pulls off a crazy plot twist a little more than halfway through the film that's truly inspired and solidifies it as a comedy."
iron-man-3,Mike Scott,False,"May 7, 2013","With its satisfying combination of humor, action and dazzling set pieces, Robert Downey Jr. and company provide everything fans of the franchise expect."
iron-man-3,Rob Humanick,False,"May 7, 2013",A superhero movie with enough intelligence and personality that it should appeal to plenty outside its intended comic book demographic.
iron-man-3,Vincent Mancini,False,"May 7, 2013","Watching a Shane Black movie is like listening to a noisy garage band, where no matter how sloppily they skronk through a verse, when they tighten up and hit that sing-along chorus, the lack of polish somehow makes it sound even better."
iron-man-3,Fr. Chris Carpenter,False,"May 7, 2013","I have found each of the ""Iron Man"" films a marked improvement over its immediate predecessor...primarily due to the trajectory of Stark's relationship with Pepper Potts and the series' more fearsome recent villains."

iron-man-3,Mike McGranaghan,False,"May 6, 2013","Iron Man 3 is a spectacularly fun ride. A superhero movie that is, indeed, super."
iron-man-3,Anthony Lane,True,"May 6, 2013","The trouble is that, as the plot quickens, any cleverness withdraws, to make way for the firecrackers of the climax. That is not Black's forte, and his movie duly slumps into a mess."
iron-man-3,Dennis Schwartz,True,"May 6, 2013",Suffers from franchise rust.
iron-man-3,Michael Dequina,True,"May 6, 2013","Like the suits Tony Stark pilots by remote throughout the film, it feels like an empty shell, all sleek and shiny and looking the part on the surface but hollow at the core."
iron-man-3,Mark Ramsey,False,"May 5, 2013","And so was born Iron Man 3, featuring the further exploits of the only superhero who is not dishwasher-safe."
iron-man-3,Tyler Hanley,False,"May 5, 2013","Despite a somewhat slow start and occasional plot missteps, Iron Man 3 ultimately soars thanks to its charismatic leading man and director Shane Black's man-on-wire balancing act of humor and action."
iron-man-3,Matt Brunson,False,"May 5, 2013","Like Iron Man 2, the movie is generally engaging, occasionally dull, frequently cluttered, and recommended with only the greatest of reservations."

iron-man-3,Diva Velez,True,"May 5, 2013","While not a complete failure as visceral eye-candy, Iron Man 3 substitutes schmaltz for inspiration and novelty. It's disappointing that what appears to be the franchise's last chapter goes out not with a bang, but with a shrug."
iron-man-3,Andrea Chase,False,"May 4, 2013","bounds with buoyant irreverence and serious suspense. The scale is large, the payoffs larger, and the sense of fun is never too far from the angst and anguish Stark endures between quips and feats of derring-do."
iron-man-3,Jim Schembri,False,"May 4, 2013",The film's army of digital artists deliver big servings of neuron-numbing spectacle. Anyone who thinks that's not important should avoid this film.

iron-man-3,Robert Roten,False,"May 4, 2013","Not as good as the first Iron Man film, but better than the second, this Iron Man sequel is a mixed bag of comedy and action, but it works well enough."
iron-man-3,Widgett Walls,False,"May 4, 2013","They decided to make a sort of mad James Bond film...except instead of Bond, you've got Tony Stark...who, by the way, has a suit of armor."
iron-man-3,Tim Brayton,False,"May 3, 2013",Not quite as much fun as Iron Man the first... but there are worse ways to welcome summer than with the low-key return of an old friend in good spirits.
iron-man-3,Steve Crum,False,"May 3, 2013","Prepare to be hoodwinked, thanks to screenwriters Drew Pearce and Shane Black. Black also directs this terrific 'Iron Man' installment, which both exhilarates and exhausts."

iron-man-3,Kevin Carr,False,"May 3, 2013",Dare I say it's the best Iron Man film yet? I dare.
iron-man-3,Richard von Busack,False,"May 3, 2013",As always in director/co-writer Shane Black-and this goes back to his cantaloupe-testicled actioners of the 1980 like The Last Boy Scout: Why waste energy mocking a convention that it might be better to do without in the first place?
iron-man-3,Mark Keizer,False,"May 3, 2013","Yet another state-of-the-art Marvel creation that strikes an entertaining balance between heart, swagger, and volume."
iron-man-3,Christopher Orr,False,"May 3, 2013","Shane Black excels at writing witty, self-referential, pop-infused banter, and there is no actor working today who is better suited to delivering it than Robert Downey Jr."
iron-man-3,Bill Gibron,False,"May 3, 2013","As a modern commentary, as a piece of pop culture popcorn pizzazz, Shane Black has started the Summer 2013 season off well."

iron-man-3,Steve Persall,True,"May 3, 2013","Iron Man 3 is missing that old Tony Stark spark. Not from Robert Downey Jr., who is still the best thing about this overblown show, with his smarter-than-thou charisma intact even while his character emotionally falls apart."
iron-man-3,Lori Hoffman,False,"May 3, 2013","Iron Man 3 packs all the clever one-liners and tons of fun we expect, while contrasting that fun with an authentic sense of menace."
iron-man-3,Ben Kendrick,False,"May 3, 2013","Iron Man 3 is not the best Marvel Studios movie, but it provides plenty of fun and excitement for both Iron Man die-hards and newly acquired Avengers fans."
iron-man-3,Kelly Vance,False,"May 3, 2013","This maelstrom of violence is exhilarating, but you'll forget about it before you reach home."
iron-man-3,Will Leitch,False,"May 3, 2013","The movie mostly cooks because of Downey, who, as always, keeps up a funny, rollicking meta-commentary on the action while engaging right in the middle of it."
iron-man-3,Sandie Angulo Chen,False,"May 3, 2013","Fewer playboy antics, but still plenty of violence."
iron-man-3,Lisa Kennedy,True,"May 3, 2013",Iron Man 3 feels like an exploitative mulching of present-day anxieties. The script is ambitious but not wise enough to be rightfully cathartic. It's more Cuisinart than art.
iron-man-3,Erick Weber,True,"May 3, 2013","A movie so block-headed, so aimlessly busy, you'd think Michael Bay directed the thing. Actually, that would be an upgrade."
iron-man-3,Michael Burgin,False,"May 3, 2013","Though Iron Man 3 is a better constructed film than its predecessor, ultimately it succeeds for the same reason the first two films did -- Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark."

iron-man-3,David Kaplan,False,"May 3, 2013","""Iron Man 3"" is rollicking, frenetic and whimsical, mostly because Downey, Jr. is given many comic lines to recite."

iron-man-3,Kurt Loder,False,"May 3, 2013",Surprisingly surprising...
iron-man-3,Matthew Razak,False,"May 3, 2013","That is why Iron Man 3 does a very smart thing, something comic fans have always known is what makes comics great: it takes a superhero and focuses on the man."
iron-man-3,Ethan Alter,False,"May 3, 2013","For half the movie, Black challenges what audiences have come to expect from comic book movies and Marvel movies in particular. But then in the other half, he falls back on the same-old same-old."
iron-man-3,Mathew DeKinder,False,"May 3, 2013","Let the other superheroes fret over the state of civilization, Iron Man just wants you to have fun and from the look of things there are no signs of rust to slow him down."

iron-man-3,Greg Evans,False,"May 3, 2013","Black (co-writing with Drew Pearce) certainly has a knack for poking exposed cultural nerves. Limbless war veterans, terrorist videos and a mass shooting find their way into his fantasy. No wonder Iron Man has PTSD."
iron-man-3,Matt Kelemen,False,"May 3, 2013","Iron Man 3 is passable mindless entertainment, but even if the film grosses $1 billion worldwide the franchise has run its course."

iron-man-3,Radheyan Simonpillai,False,"May 3, 2013","Iron Man 3 follows a psychologically tormented hero who has light-hearted fun while engaging in cartoonish mayhem and uncovering corruption that reflects on contemporary politics. If that sentence sounded like a mouthful, just imagine the movie."
iron-man-3,Marshall Fine,True,"May 3, 2013",Black chooses to pump up the action to a size that makes it hard to focus the film's actual excitement.
iron-man-3,Jonathan W. Hickman,False,"May 3, 2013","The movie trades on the continuing Marvel film universe without expanding it in any appreciable way. Ultimately, you will have had enough of Tony Stark when this one ends and that's not how Tony would want it."

iron-man-3,John Hanlon,False,"May 3, 2013","With great performances from Robert Downey Jr. and Ben Kingsley, this superhero adventure is a blast and a thrilling kick off to the summer of 2013."
iron-man-3,Michelle Alexandria,True,"May 3, 2013",Iron Man 3 starts off great but crashes and burns in a spectacular way. We get it Marvel you don't give a crap about your Comic Book readers. You don't have to constantly rub in people's faces. Horrible 3rd act.
iron-man-3,Rene Rodriguez,False,"May 3, 2013","Just like he does with those crummy Sherlock Holmes movies, Downey elevates this rather flimsy material with his sheer presence."
iron-man-3,David 'Mad Dog' Bradley,False,"May 2, 2013","With a few good jokes, another committed performance by Downey and a fine one by Kingsley, this is still great fun, regardless of sequelitis and whether you're a freak-flag fanboy or not."

iron-man-3,Pablo Villaça,True,"May 2, 2013","Se Tony Stark faz rir com eficincia, seus momentos dramticos soam rasos em funo da sensao de que estamos apenas vendo Robert Downey Jr. interpretando Robert Downey Jr. enquanto este vive Stark."
iron-man-3,Paul Chambers,False,"May 2, 2013","Tony Stark, as played by Downey, is more than just a rich self-centered inventor. He's stylishly glib, smart and overwhelmingly cool. Downey is what makes the movie tick."

iron-man-3,Rick Bentley,False,"May 2, 2013",Those who enjoy comic-book-inspired films merely for the action will find this latest attempt a solid effort. But comic book purists will have to deal with seeing less Iron Man and some twists that defy the accepted mythology of Marvel Comics.

iron-man-3,Kirk Baird,True,"May 2, 2013",A superhero in film is only as good as his villain. And that's a critical problem for Iron Man 3.

iron-man-3,Stephen Silver,False,"May 2, 2013",Doesn't break any new ground or transcend its genre. But it's still very entertaining and never boring.

iron-man-3,Michael Sragow,True,"May 2, 2013","It would be just a special-effects-and-hardware extravaganza, with a dead-end script full of wrong turns, were it not for Robert Downey Jr. and a game and witty cast."
iron-man-3,Nell Minow,False,"May 2, 2013","What matters is Downey's total commitment to playing Stark as a flawed, complex, but greatly gifted character."

iron-man-3,Kenneth Turan,False,"May 2, 2013","By even posing questions of identity, the film creates the kind of jeopardy we can believe in, and for a superhero movie, that is an accomplishment in and of itself."

iron-man-3,Ann Hornaday,True,"May 2, 2013","From its anxious protagonist and the battered metal sheaths he dons to save the world to the clattering, fiery mayhem that ensues with metronomic predictability, Iron Man 3 is less a movie than a final war whoop let loose before utter exhaustion sets in."

iron-man-3,Joe Morgenstern,True,"May 2, 2013",The third iteration of a franchise that began so well becomes a hollow hymn to martial gadgetry. The suits and story clank in unison.
iron-man-3,Tom Charity,False,"May 2, 2013","It's a confidently tongue-in-cheek piece of blockbuster engineering, sweetly calibrated to Downey's cavalier appeal and to Kingsley's oddball interjections."
iron-man-3,Bob Bloom,True,"May 2, 2013","If it were not for (Robert) Downey (Jr.), ""Iron Man 3"" would be a total disaster, undermined by a haphazard, disjointed and sloppy plot."
iron-man-3,Duane Dudek,True,"May 2, 2013","""Iron Man 3"" suffers an identity crisis resembling that of the title superhero's alter-ego, billionaire Tony Stark, played by Robert Downey Jr."

iron-man-3,Rob Vaux,False,"May 2, 2013","Whether it marks an ending, a beginning or something in between, it really doesn't matter. Iron Man 3 starts the summer off right."
iron-man-3,Steven Rea,True,"May 2, 2013","The action plays like a video game because, well, it may as well be."
iron-man-3,Andrew O'Hehir,False,"May 2, 2013",[Black] strikes a tone of pseudo-edgy frat-boy black comedy that's so retro it's almost charming.
iron-man-3,Chris Vognar,False,"May 2, 2013","The movie is shrewd enough to skitter along so frenetically that nothing, not even tonal contradiction, can stick."
iron-man-3,Jeffrey Lyles,False,"May 2, 2013","At times reaches ""Avengers"" level of intensity, fun and exhilaration, which makes it all the more frustrating that a few missteps result in it simply being a good movie and not the post-Avengers game changer it could have been."
iron-man-3,Peter Howell,False,"May 2, 2013","Downey is in fine comic form, especially when he's sparring with young Simpkins, who thankfully throttles back on the precociousness."
iron-man-3,Rick Marshall,False,"May 2, 2013",Iron Man 3 defies typical third-chapter drop-off and makes it clear that the franchise is in good hands with its new director.
iron-man-3,Frank Swietek,True,"May 2, 2013","Dark, gloomy, chaotic and basically misanthrophic...Iron Man in Dark Knight territory."
iron-man-3,Kimberly Gadette,False,"May 2, 2013","As compared to the overwrought, too-many-irons-in-the-fire second installment, Iron Man 3 proves its metal, oops, mettle, once again."
iron-man-3,Austin Kennedy,False,"May 2, 2013","If you keep your expectations realistic, IRON MAN 3 will not disappoint. It's a great popcorn movie and a perfect way to start off the summer movie season!"
iron-man-3,Jeff Meyers,False,"May 2, 2013","Like most franchise sequels it goes overboard with supporting characters, plot complications and let's-top-that action sequences. But there's never any real sense of drama."
iron-man-3,Joe Gross,False,"May 2, 2013","If you have no investment in the larger Marvel movie universe, it could very well stand as the most accessible, easy-to-enjoy Iron Man movie."
iron-man-3,Peter Travers,True,"May 2, 2013","But for all the clanking armies of iron knights on display to dazzle the eager kid in each of us, this summer epic rings hollow. There's no one home inside the suit."
iron-man-3,Tom Long,False,"May 2, 2013","For the second year in a row, Marvel is starting the summer off with a bang. Let the blockbusters begin, and let's see if they can top this."
iron-man-3,Lawrence Toppman,False,"May 2, 2013","By the time innumerable suits of armor were flying through the air, instantly assembling and disassembling themselves around Tony Stark while he was running and jumping, I was worn out. But the ride up to then had been a jolt of continuous pleasure."
iron-man-3,Cary Darling,False,"May 2, 2013","Iron Man 3 manages to rise above its naked ambitions thanks to ... Robert Downey Jr.'s sly charm ... and Ben Kingsley's too-short and ... hilarious turn as the villainous Mandarin, a clever update on the comic-book character created in the '60s."
iron-man-3,Louis Black,False,"May 2, 2013","The film provides more of the same and nothing startlingly innovative, but what's here is good."
iron-man-3,Brian Orndorf,True,"May 2, 2013","One major sequence nearly saves the whole endeavor, but what Black has here is flat and overstuffed with contrived comic book business, feeling about as heavy and immobile as Stark's famous armor."
iron-man-3,Chris Bumbray,False,"May 2, 2013","Even though some purists may object to some of the twists and turns Black and company have managed to incorporate, for me, these twists are what makes IRON MAN 3 standout from the pack a bit"
iron-man-3,Jeff Beck,True,"May 2, 2013","The first film might have been able to get by on charm alone, but the mechanical feeling of this entry will more than likely leave you cold and indifferent."
iron-man-3,Jason Buchanan,False,"May 2, 2013","The longest film in the series by a handful of minutes, Iron Man 3 certainly doesn't feel like it thanks to its briskly paced screenplay and the wise decision to place some of Iron Man's most heroic moments toward the end of the movie."
iron-man-3,J. R. Jones,False,"May 2, 2013","This installment actually flirts with satire, sending its hero-in-a-can on a vengeful mission against a mad, bearded jihadist before yanking the rug out from under the neocon story line. There are some good laughs as well."
iron-man-3,Chris Hewitt,False,"May 2, 2013","Black restores a light touch to the series, at least until the bloated finale, and puts the focus back on what has always separated this franchise from every other superhero movie: the wit and intelligence of Robert Downey Jr."
iron-man-3,Joe Williams,True,"May 2, 2013","It's lightweight but slow, padded with cheap jokes to disguise how hollow it is."
iron-man-3,Daniel Eagan,False,"May 2, 2013","Third entry more than lives up to the promise of the original Iron Man, and marks an exciting return to form for a franchise that had dipped in quality."
iron-man-3,Dave White,False,"May 2, 2013",[Shane] Black is the reason for the season and Downey is his Santa Claus
iron-man-3,Manohla Dargis,True,"May 2, 2013","The ""Iron Man"" films turned Mr. Downey into a huge star, but the role has gradually, maybe inexorably, swallowed him."
iron-man-3,Kevin McCarthy,False,"May 2, 2013","The epic action brought nerd tears to my eyes! Shane Black delivers a witty, action-packed flick with great twists. See it in 2D as the 3D conversion lacks great depth!"
iron-man-3,Claudia Puig,False,"May 2, 2013","The rambunctious Iron Man 3 is a briskly paced thrill ride until about 90 minutes in, when the excitement wanes. A few late-breaking surprises re-invigorate the tale, however."

iron-man-3,Moira MacDonald,False,"May 2, 2013","""Iron Man 3"" is definitely a big perk-up from the almost-but-not-quite-listless ""Iron Man 2""; maybe hanging out with the Avengers was a tonic for him."

iron-man-3,James Berardinelli,False,"May 2, 2013","The level of acting, at one time viewed as negligible in a superhero movie, is top-notch and no one seems to be mailing it in."
iron-man-3,Dana Stevens,True,"May 2, 2013","Unfortunately, [its] sharp-eyed domestic comedy is dwarfed by the far less well-written supervillain crime plot that surrounds it."
iron-man-3,Bruce Kirkland,False,"May 2, 2013","Iron Man 3 is over-sized, ear-splitting and relentlessly intense."
iron-man-3,Laura Clifford,False,"May 2, 2013","...the best of the Marvel films with its complex story, exciting action, great cast and special effects."
iron-man-3,Joe Neumaier,False,"May 2, 2013",It sharply fuses the humor and heart of the earlier films with a satisfyingly heavy-metal strength - and a darkness that's more than earned.
iron-man-3,A.A. Dowd,True,"May 2, 2013","It's hard not to wish Downey were sparring with his costumed comrades again, instead of trading barbs with the far-less-colorful cast members-old and new-of this busy, sporadically diverting sequel."
iron-man-3,Matt Zoller Seitz,False,"May 2, 2013","The new film's not great, but it's consistently involving because the tonal shifts are so abrupt."
iron-man-3,Jim Judy,False,"May 2, 2013","Like the best films of this genre, much of the massive budget clearly ended up on the screen and thus diehard fans and even casual moviegoers will certainly get their money's worth. (Complete Content Details for Parents also available)"
iron-man-3,Christopher Lloyd,True,"May 2, 2013","With superhero movies, over time the mythology gets junked up with tertiary characters and leftover storylines. Tony Stark & Co. have taken the Iron Man franchise as far as it can go."

iron-man-3,Daniel M. Kimmel,False,"May 1, 2013",Downey's performance is impeccable. He gets that he's not simply playing a comic book character for the fourth time but a character who is evolving.
iron-man-3,Bill Goodykoontz,False,"May 1, 2013","Downey is as funny as ever, if not more so. He ensures that Iron Man 3 is a solid installment in the franchise, and helps to make it seem, at least for a time, that it might be something more."
iron-man-3,Michael Phillips,True,"May 1, 2013",It's not without its payoffs; I enjoyed a lot of it. But overall last year's Avengers delivered the bombastic goods more efficiently than this year's Marvel.

iron-man-3,Matt Patches,False,"May 1, 2013","Iron Man 3 avoids fantasy in favor of a hefty helping of pulp fiction. The setup makes way for Downey, Jr.'s best work in the franchise."
iron-man-3,Richard Corliss,False,"May 1, 2013","Besides rehabbing a hero who overcomes anxiety to save the world and defeat the terror-industrial complex by the simple matter of cloning his body armor, the movie proves that there's still intelligent life on Planet Marvel."
iron-man-3,Steven D. Greydanus,True,"May 1, 2013","Pepper has always been what grounded Tony, what connected him to reality. Iron Man 3 ultimately disconnects Pepper from reality...Whether or not Tony deserves better, Pepper certainly does."

iron-man-3,Devin Faraci,False,"Apr 30, 2013","This isn't just the best Iron Man movie, it's a recharge to the whole shared universe concept. Marvel can make movies that exist together while still having unique, awesome identities of their own."

iron-man-3,CJ Johnson,False,"Apr 29, 2013","Paltrow, who plays love interest Pepper Potts (and in a much bigger showing here) said in an interview I heard recently ... that Downey improvised hugely in the first two films but stuck more to the script here. They should have let him flow."

iron-man-3,Mark Ellis,False,"Apr 29, 2013","Some eye-popping action sequences at least make this a worthy summer endeavor for movie fans, but it felt like ""Iron Man 3"" got such a big lead in the first half, it was content to run out the clock late in the game."
iron-man-3,Marc Fennell,False,"Apr 29, 2013",Watching Robert Downey Jr play a charismatic swaggering d*ck is entertaining. Watching him play an emotionally damaged swaggering d*ck is compelling. With huge laughs and hugely entertaining twists Iron Man 3 is easily on of the best Marvel movies
iron-man-3,Stephanie Zacharek,True,"Apr 29, 2013",The big problems with Iron Man 3 are less specific to the movie itself than they are characteristic of the hypermalaise that's infected so many current mega-blockbusters.
iron-man-3,Luke Y. Thompson,False,"Apr 29, 2013",It's only May - or will be by the time you see it - but cinema Santa came early. Joy to the nerds - this movie is as good as its photoshopped posters were amateurish.

iron-man-3,Ed Whitfield,False,"Apr 26, 2013",Marvel's employed a core vote strategy with this movie: it's about keeping the audience they have rather than building on the one they've got.

iron-man-3,Matthew Toomey,False,"Apr 23, 2013","Given that so many of today's action films are crafted from the same mould, it was a pleasant surprise to see Iron Man 3 taking a few chances and offering a few unexpected twists."
iron-man-3,Dominic Corry,False,"Apr 23, 2013",Superhero movies just don't get better than this.
iron-man-3,Kate Muir,False,"Apr 22, 2013","In the annals of superhero movies, this is not the most thrilling, but it does contain two Downton Abbey jokes, and a stonking performance from Downey."
iron-man-3,Tom Huddleston,False,"Apr 22, 2013",It's undeniably entertaining - and worth seeing for Kingsley alone - with the misfires never fully overshadowing the moments of glory.
iron-man-3,Peter Bradshaw,False,"Apr 22, 2013",To use a recondite term in professional film criticism: whoo-hoo!
iron-man-3,Robbie Collin,False,"Apr 19, 2013",Black has an instinctive feel for balancing action set-pieces against the passages of soap-opera that are required to make them matter.

iron-man,Rachel Wagner,False,"Mar 26, 2021",One of the best they've ever made
iron-man,David Hogan,False,"Feb 24, 2021",A fun two-hours thanks to a top cast lead by a charismatic Robert Downey Jr. Most of the effects still hold up and the action scenes are still exciting.

iron-man,Siddhant Adlakha,False,"Dec 15, 2019","Marvel's questions of intervention are locked within an invisible framework, one that allows for lip-service to questioning power, yet one that implicitly comes down on the side of power itself, forever protecting the American status quo."
iron-man,Micheal Compton,False,"Oct 29, 2019","This is Downey at the top of his game, delivering a performance full of humor and self-awareness."
iron-man,Kaitlyn Booth,False,"May 15, 2019","Iron Man might feature a mesmerizing performance by Robert Downey Jr. and kicked off the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but that doesn't entirely save it from a weak villain or falling apart by the third act."
iron-man,Danielle Solzman,False,"Apr 17, 2019",Iron Man may just be one adventure but the film is a lot more than that because it has the main responsibility of launching an entire Marvel Cinematic Universe.
iron-man,Colby Bryant,False,"Dec 8, 2018","Few of the films in the (MCU) are as accessible as this one, and while you may not love it in your top-ten films of all-time, you can't beat the good time this film brings."

iron-man,Zaki Hasan,False,"Nov 2, 2018",Iron Man is of such caliber that it makes the other films from the Marvel canon seem lesser by comparison.
iron-man,Karl French,False,"Oct 7, 2018","Still, if the film is ultimately disappointing it is in part because it begins so well, and there is a lot to enjoy before the over-the-top final act."
iron-man,Leona Laurie,False,"Aug 29, 2018","The movie that proved it's possible to make GOOD superhero movies, ushering in the MCU and teaching DC absolutely nothing."
iron-man,Marcianne Miller,False,"Aug 26, 2018",It's perhaps the most thrilling tribute to good old American ingenuity the movies have given us in ages.
iron-man,Deborah Ross,True,"Aug 23, 2018","I like Downey Jr, usually, with his dark wounded eyes, but here his performance veers between going though the motions and a look which seems to say, ""Hey, what film am I doing again?"""
iron-man,Sean Axmaker,False,"Jan 13, 2017","It's faithful to the comic origins without being slavish, draws ideas from the entire run of the series, and stirs a self-aware sense of humor through the action while still taking the enterprise seriously."
iron-man,Mike Scott,False,"Jun 15, 2015","His well-honed acting chops aside, a big reason the casting of Downey as Stark works so darn well is that incorrigible streak, which he somehow always has been able to balance with an irrepressible likability and which he uses to full effect here."
iron-man,Clint O'Connor,False,"Jun 15, 2015","Injecting the brilliantly bright, quick, and clever life force that is Robert Downey Jr. into the comic-book superhero realm is a masterstroke, a kick in the head to the tired franchises of the genre."
iron-man,Craig Outhier,False,"Jun 15, 2015","Led by Downey's career-resurrecting performance as billionaire weapons peddler Tony Stark, it proves just as indispensable to the movie's giddy escapist appeal as the seamless CGI effects and eye-popping pyrotechnics."

iron-man,Nicholas Barber,False,"Jun 15, 2015","Iron Man is enjoyable, snappily scripted, unpatronising entertainment, but it can't dispel a niggling sense that it's not quite as good as you want it to be."
iron-man,Craig D. Lindsey,False,"Jun 15, 2015","While Iron Man seems to be an OK comic-book flick, I wish it could've been just as sparkling as Downey's performance. But hey, it could've been worse."
iron-man,John Serba,False,"Jun 15, 2015",Downey's performance is larger and more animated than the action and special effects; he's the heart beneath Iron Man's titanium plating and the best reason to see the film.
iron-man,Katherine Monk,False,"Jun 15, 2015","Neither the message nor the sparingly used special effects get in the way of entertainment, proving Iron Man really is a throwback to a kinder, gentler and decidedly more fun era of subversive filmmaking."
iron-man,David Stratton,False,"Jun 15, 2015","What gives this its distinction [is] Robert Downey Jr, who is terrific."
iron-man,Dann Gire,False,"Jun 9, 2015","It's Downey who anchors the movie's mayhem and special effects with a caustic wit and an intense, centered humanity."

iron-man,Andrew Hedley,False,"Jun 9, 2015","Ultimately the inspired casting, snappy humour and whizz-bang technology are the equivalent of giving your old car a new coat of paint. Iron Man is entertaining, but it still runs on the same old superhero formula."
iron-man,Robert Hanks,False,"Jun 9, 2015","Iron Man manages to be both a lot of fun, and quite possibly the most effective commentary on the war on terror that Hollywood has produced so far -- not the best argued or the most committed, but the one that most people will see, and think about."
iron-man,James Rundle,False,"Jun 9, 2015",The real joy of Iron Man is its humour.
iron-man,James Sanford,False,"Jun 9, 2015","He's slyly funny and charmingly despicable in the early stretches of the film, which seem to good-naturedly spoof Downey's wild-child image. He also manages to make Stark's (literal) change of heart thoroughly convincing."
iron-man,Margot Harrison,False,"Jun 9, 2015","Despite the crisis-of-conscience theme, all of this could have been pretty standard fare. But Favreau had the sense to cast Downey, who does for this potential franchise what Johnny Depp did for Pirates of the Caribbean."
iron-man,Steve Persall,False,"Jun 9, 2015","Director Jon Favreau builds a sturdy foundation for a franchise, an origins story that isn't as familiar as Batman's or Spider-Man's and unburdened by the angst of murdered relatives and messianic guilt."
iron-man,Nick Curtis,False,"Jun 9, 2015","There's a satisfyingly climactic CGI battle, but Downey Jr tops it in the witty denouement with pure acting skill."

iron-man,Henry Fitzherbert,False,"Aug 25, 2014","Iron Man never feels like a laboured prologue that's simply laying the groundwork for further instalments. It's a zippy, action-packed adventure in its own right, boasting top-drawer special effects and some cracking action sequences."
iron-man,Margaret Barton-Fumo,False,"May 14, 2014","Iron Man trumps his morally compromised, brooding heroic brethren with the best setback of them all: He has no superpowers. He's just a man with a smart mouth and a head for figures in a really cool, practically indestructible iron suit."
iron-man,Aaron Mesh,False,"Aug 4, 2013",Iron Man is better when Robert Downey Jr. is alone on the screen than when he's sharing it. It's when those inconvenient other people show up that the movie loses its way.
iron-man,Corey Hall,False,"Aug 4, 2013","The key, of course, is Downey, who effortlessly conveys that his newfound sense of responsibility isn't going to stop him from having a good time, and in doing so, Iron Man makes saving the world look like fun again."

iron-man,Tony Macklin,False,"Feb 1, 2009","Iron Man is an appealing superhero movie. It's also clunky. It's welded together out of disparate pieces that clank and ping. Though at times it's leaden, Iron Man also has enough moments of pizazz to intermittently soar."

iron-man,Jim Emerson,False,"Oct 18, 2008","Not only is it a good comic book movie (smart and stupid, stirring and silly, intimate and spectacular), it's winning enough to engage even those who've never cared much for comic books or the movies they spawn. Like me."

iron-man,Karina Montgomery,False,"Jul 17, 2008","The pace is good, not frantic, not ""oh god we have to get to the explosions or we're gonna lose them"" %u2013 and the actors are all above average at least. (Our leads are no strangers to the Oscar nomination process.)"
iron-man,Wesley Lovell,False,"Jul 13, 2008","One of the strongest entries into the superhero movie canon of recent years. While featuring a few flaws, this is one of the most entertaining comic book adaptations in last few years."

iron-man,Beth Accomando,False,"Jun 8, 2008",This may not be what the Academy has in mind when it's considering the Oscar worthy performances but Downey finds the reality of being a superhero and makes us buy into that. Final verdict: Iron Man is cool and Downey is hot.

iron-man,Nick Rogers,False,"May 12, 2008","Director Jon Favreau displays the same wonderment and control over visual effects as he did in 2005's underrated ""Zathura."" Excepting a clunky prologue and escape sequence, it's a flawlessly paced origin story with humor, smarts and soul."

iron-man,John Beifuss,False,"May 9, 2008","Exciting, but the message is mixed: Stark's creation of Iron Man affirms rather than repudiates his arms race-exploiting past -- it proves once again that the one with the best weapons wins."

iron-man,Mike McGranaghan,False,"May 2, 2008","The film nevertheless makes the crucial decision to set its story in the real world, to have its characters face real moral decisions with real consequences. And then, when Iron Man does show up for battle, this flick just soars."
iron-man,Joe Morgenstern,False,"May 2, 2008","The gadgetry is absolutely dazzling, the action is mostly exhilarating, the comedy is scintillating and the whole enormous enterprise throbs with dramatic energy."
iron-man,Mick LaSalle,False,"May 2, 2008",Iron Man is an action sci-fi blockbuster extravaganza that provides cartoon thrills for thinking people. It's the best movie of its kind since the second Spider-Man movie four years ago.

iron-man,Peter Rainer,True,"May 2, 2008","When Iron Man is zooming above bejewelled southern California, I expected a thundering lyricism but instead settled for some routine CGI stunts. I suppose it's asking too much for a great actor to be matched up with a great director."
iron-man,Wesley Morris,False,"May 2, 2008",Downey could have taken a tragic tack. But he has fun just figuring out how to make the armor suit work. His sarcasm and almost drunken Tony Curtis body language transform the scenes of Iron Man.

iron-man,Tim Robey,False,"May 2, 2008","Based on yet another Marvel series, Iron Man has plenty of things going for it, the main assets being an enjoyably sardonic Downey, his hardware, and the downturned mouth of his new metal visage - a warning that this self-styled messiah means business."

iron-man,Gina Carbone,False,"May 1, 2008","Dangerously dependant on Robert Downey Jr. for entertainment. He throws a one-man party during every scene. But when he's off-screen, the film wilts. (Yes, even with Jeff Bridges' anti-Dude.) Re-cast, it would only be a shade better than Daredevil."

iron-man,James Rocchi,False,"May 1, 2008","It's as if someone snuck a hefty slug of bourbon into your cherry cola; all of the sugar and flavor and fizz you expect from a well-made comic-book movie are there, but there's something a little more grown-up going on behind them."

iron-man,Andrea Chase,False,"May 1, 2008","Iron Man is terrific. Full of explosions, one-liners, and nifty special effects, it goes the extra mile of casting Robert Downey, Jr., one of the best actors working today, in the title role"
iron-man,Eric D. Snider,False,"May 1, 2008","Iron Man isn't the most well-known or beloved title in the Marvel comic book canon, yet the film adaptation proves to be as plucky, as confident, and as polished as if it were the keystone."

iron-man,Chris Vognar,False,"May 1, 2008",A superhero debut with brains and brawn.
iron-man,Mark Rahner,False,"May 1, 2008","The payoff of casting Downey is as big as the risk. He's not in the movie, he owns it in a way that makes it hard to imagine without him."

spider-man-far-from-home,Tim Grierson,True,"Jun 27, 2019","Boasting a breezy spirit and Tom Holland's likeable turn as the titular webslinger, ""Far From Home"" is adequately rousing and jokey, but too often it has the feel of a transitional chapter in the ongoing Marvel saga."

spider-man-homecoming,Andy Psyllides,False,"Jul 6, 2017","Charming, fleet-footed and frequently hilarious, this latest take on the web-slinging do-gooder - the third since the early 2000s - is some seriously top-drawer fluff."

spider-man-homecoming,Rob Carnevale,False,"Jul 6, 2017",It's fun. John Watts' film carries an innocence and wide-eyed brashness befitting its central character's coming-of-age journey. But it's also capable of surprising.

spider-man-homecoming,Kristian M. Lin,False,"Jul 6, 2017",Spider-Man: Homecoming benefits from its small scale and its focus on Peter's day-to-day teenage existence. The Marvel movies could use more of this.
spider-man-homecoming,Gonzalo Lira Galván,False,"Jul 6, 2017","A summer film that re-creates in a surprisingly entertaining way the myth of a hero in the era of technology, and that all it seeks is to connect with a young audience eager to skip school and go to the movies. [Full review in Spanish]"

spider-man-homecoming,Jeff Reed,False,"Jul 6, 2017","In Holland, the silver screen has its youngest and best Spider-Man yet. He's juvenile, irresponsible and amateur. He's a kid. And you feel for him, since we've all experienced the social pressures of school."

spider-man-homecoming,Dann Gire,False,"Jul 6, 2017",Holland plays a 15-year-old Peter Parker with such joyous naiveté and youthful exuberance that his predecessors -- the nerdy Tobey Maguire and the neatly coifed Andrew Garfield -- now seem more like grad students than high schoolers.

spider-man-homecoming,Steve Persall,False,"Jul 6, 2017","Spider-Man: Homecoming does the improbable, successfully rebooting a reboot of a trilogy that did the job well enough only a decade ago. It's a movie that could be unnecessary but isn't."
spider-man-homecoming,Brian Lowry,False,"Jul 6, 2017","Just as the character's primary goal here is about proving himself, in terms of Marvel injecting a rejuvenating vitality into its wayward wall-crawler, ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" clears that bar and then some."
spider-man-homecoming,Pete Hammond,False,"Jul 6, 2017",A smart and entertaining reboot of the Spider-Man franchise is young at heart and in execution. This could be the first true coming of age comic book movie that adults will like just as much as their kids.

spider-man-homecoming,Frank Swietek,False,"Jul 5, 2017","A mixed bag: it's nice to have Spider-Man rebooted with an actor so right for the part as Holland, but the effort to integrate him into the wider Marvel Universe raises doubts the movie doesn't resolve."

spider-man-homecoming,Gary Thompson,False,"Jul 5, 2017","The movie is as bubbly and eager as Peter himself, but a little more efficient. It designs its actions sequences around character and story and - a rare thing in comic-book blockbusters - lets the actors act during the climactic action piece."
spider-man-homecoming,Mark Hughes,False,"Jul 5, 2017",[T]he perfect Spider-Man movie and one of the best films yet in the MCU. Audiences are going to fall in love with it...
spider-man-homecoming,James Berardinelli,True,"Jul 5, 2017","The movie lacks inspiration; even the big ""twist"" is more worthy of a suppressed chuckle than a dropped jaw - it's like something pulled out of a bad soap opera."
spider-man-homecoming,Rob Vaux,False,"Jul 5, 2017",The fifth-best superhero film so far this year... is still pretty darn good.
spider-man-homecoming,Ty Burr,False,"Jul 5, 2017","Adolescent in all the right ways: limber, reckless, full of youthful brio and uncertainty."
spider-man-homecoming,Mick LaSalle,True,"Jul 5, 2017","The movie breaks no new ground, and action sequences that were intended to be thrilling - such as an epic battle on the Staten Island Ferry - just sit there on the screen, incapable of stirring a single pulse, but content in their competence."

spider-man-homecoming,Christopher Machell,False,"Jul 5, 2017","What Spider-Man: Homecoming lacks in depth, it more than makes up for with a pop sensibility that fizzes with verve and fun."

spider-man-homecoming,Soren Andersen,False,"Jul 4, 2017","This third time's the charm in Marvel's pantheon of Spider-Man portrayers. Tobey Maguire was pretty good, Andrew Garfield was so-so, but Holland ... Well, when you've got it, you've got it."

spider-man-homecoming,Wenlei Ma,False,"Jul 3, 2017",Stark tells Peter to be the friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man and that's exactly what Jon Watts has given us - a grounded hero who has to live in our world. All other superhero directors should take note.

spider-man-homecoming,A.A. Dowd,False,"Jul 1, 2017","For a film with six screenwriters, Homecoming creates a remarkably coherent vision of a smart kid still dumb about the world, battling the learning curves of his double lives."
spider-man-homecoming,Adam Woodward,False,"Jul 1, 2017",This isn't the same old story of how Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man but rather the story of Spider-Man learning how to be Peter Parker.

spider-man-homecoming,Oliver Jones,False,"Jun 30, 2017","As long as the kids stay in the picture -- thankfully, that's most of the movie -- Spider-Man: Homecoming is the fun playdate most of us have been looking forward to since the character stole Cap's shield last spring in Captain America: Civil War."
spider-man-homecoming,Harry Guerin,False,"Jun 30, 2017","The less you know about the plot the more the fun, suffice to say that Homecoming trades adolescent angst for hit-the-spot humour (top work from co-stars Jacob Batalon and Zendaya) and throws in some surprises 'twixt webs and wisecracks."

spider-man-homecoming,Abigail Chandler,False,"Jun 30, 2017","The less you know about the gags and twists in this film, the better. Go in as blind as you can and just enjoy the ride. You probably won't see a better or more satisfying superhero film all year."

spider-man-homecoming,Robbie Collin,True,"Jun 30, 2017",A little of the new Spider-Man went an exhilaratingly long way in Captain America: Civil War last year. But a lot of him goes almost nowhere in this slack and spiritless solo escapade.

spider-man-homecoming,Jonathan L. Fischer,False,"Jun 29, 2017",Spider-Man: Homecoming is both a homecoming for the character as well as a movie in which Spider-Man literally goes to homecoming-a fitting re-introduction and an endearingly goofy teen flick.

spider-man-no-way-home,John Wenzel,False,"Dec 20, 2021","Despite Marvel's usual bloat and a swirling storm of characters, ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" earns its joy and sorrow with thematic substance, the breathless action often contrasted with quiet reflection and grief."
spider-man-no-way-home,Aaron Dicer,False,"Dec 20, 2021",It's astonishing how good Marvel is at playing with their toys. Fan service can be fun when it isn't at the expense of serving characters or story. It can be sheer euphoria when it manages to ENHANCE character and story. This movie is sheer euphoria.
spider-man-no-way-home,Ani Bundel,False,"Dec 20, 2021","An overstuffed homage to Sony and Marvel's two decades in the Spider-fam business, the film nevertheless manages to be utterly charming, a feel-good two-and-a-half hour last hurrah for fans."

spider-man-no-way-home,Sandra Hall,False,"Dec 20, 2021","It's a form of breaking the fourth wall, inviting the audience in to share a joke with the actors, and verges on parody. Yet somehow they carry it off without diluting our sense of involvement with Peter and those he loves."

spider-man-no-way-home,Ed Whitfield,False,"Dec 19, 2021","It's all part of a knowing scheme that repurposes what came before to create an Endgame sense of anticipation and payoff. It's wholly unearned, but you have to give producer Kevin Feige credit - recycling has never been this profitable."

spider-man-no-way-home,Abby Olcese,False,"Dec 18, 2021","There's nothing earth-shattering going on here, but it is highly enjoyable entertainment and a loving, mostly well-executed piece of character speculation.

spider-man-no-way-home,Walter Chaw,False,"Dec 17, 2021","The sloppy is so sloppy, the slow so slow, the action so house. What works about Spider-Man: No Way Home (hereafter No Way Home) is its essential understanding of Spider-Man as basically just a good kid."

spider-man-no-way-home,MontiLee Stormer,False,"Dec 17, 2021","It feels exuberant and ridiculous, but it's a superhero movie. A kid bitten by a spider, in a suit made by a genius, swings from synthetic webbing - but sure, let's nitpick ""reality."""

spider-man-no-way-home,Patricia Puentes,True,"Dec 17, 2021","The best parts of this bloated and uneven two-and-a-half-hour movie are the connections to past Spidey versions.

the-avengers,Justin Craig,False,"Sep 10, 2012","Marvel's ""The Avengers"" is the super-hero movie to end all super-hero movies. Why? Joss Whedon."
the-avengers,Erick Weber,False,"Aug 24, 2012","Without Robert Downey Jr. delivering his witty quips in patented rat-a-tat-tat fashion, The Avengers would largely be a soulless shell of a movie that could be mistaken for a Michael Bay production."
the-avengers,Witney Seibold,True,"Aug 22, 2012","After years of buildup and prequels, ""The Avengers"" is merely average."
the-avengers,William Bibbiani,False,"Aug 22, 2012","The first great superhero team movie, and a film that captures the essence of what makes the Marvel Universe great."
the-avengers,Kirk Honeycutt,True,"Jul 13, 2012","The filmmakers play a conservative game, not setting out to make a great movie but simply making sure not to screw it up an entire franchise."
the-avengers,John Gholson,False,"Jul 3, 2012",Feels like actual Marvel Comics are being injected directly into your bloodstream. It's simply jaw-dropping.
the-avengers,Jim Schembri,False,"Jun 30, 2012","While it reflects a movie culture that has traded originality for scale - one wonders if there's a shred of originality anywhere in the film - The Avengers is grand, throwaway fun."
the-avengers,Stephen Rebello,False,"Jun 23, 2012","It's as big, funny, shiny, explosive, expert, rip-roaringly entertaining an action movie as we've seen in a long time."
the-avengers,Linda Cook,False,"Jun 23, 2012","Yeah, it's all that. A tent-pole cash cow for the studio, a dream come true for fans, and treat for action aficionados, 'The Avengers' comes at you as the first true ""summer movie spectacular"" of the 2012 season."
the-avengers,Nathaniel Rogers,False,"Jun 22, 2012",Wonderful blink and you'll miss them comic beats in the middle of the finale's mayhem. And what glorious mayhem!
the-avengers,Jeffrey Overstreet,False,"Jun 15, 2012",... The movie isn't so much a work of storytelling as it is a marathon of wish-fulfillment moments for comic book enthusiasts -- punches peppered with punchlines.
the-avengers,Wesley Lovell,False,"Jun 13, 2012",The culmination of four distinct franchises is an exciting and entertaining product.
the-avengers,Tricia Olszewski,False,"Jun 1, 2012",It's the humor that's The Avengers' strength.
the-avengers,Joanne Laurier,True,"May 31, 2012","One hundred and forty-three minutes of head-pounding bombast, The Avengers is an exhausting experience."

the-avengers,Robert Denerstein,False,"May 24, 2012",Comic-book movie delivers the goods
the-avengers,David Nusair,True,"May 24, 2012","By the time the utterly routine (and decidedly endless) finale rolls around, Marvel's The Avengers has unquestionably squandered the potential of its premise and its cast..."
the-avengers,Jeffrey Lyles,False,"May 22, 2012",Delivers big time with everything longtime fans and newcomers alike could possibly want in a summer blockbuster that definitely surpasses the hype.
the-avengers,Jeanne Kaplan,False,"May 18, 2012","This too-long adventure is a sensory overload --- complete with loud, protracted battle scenes and hunky super heroes who provide the necessary eye candy. It's also very funny, and highly entertaining."
the-avengers,David Kaplan,False,"May 18, 2012","There is much humor laced throughout the film, giving it an air of not taking itself too seriously -- which is as it should be in a film of this genre."
the-avengers,Jim Lane,False,"May 17, 2012",... tremendous fun ...
the-avengers,Diana Saenger,False,"May 17, 2012",A creative team WOW

the-avengers,Jeff Bayer,False,"May 16, 2012",It's a blockbuster that manages to please with intelligence and fun. Whedon makes it look easy.
the-avengers,Sara Michelle Fetters,False,"May 15, 2012","Whedon manages all these disparate threads confidently, his script a model of self-control and restraint that's far from typical for the genre."
the-avengers,Chris Barsanti,False,"May 14, 2012",It's all very smoothly done but comes without a hint of surprise or revelation.
the-avengers,Glenn Lovell,False,"May 12, 2012","The Main Event is pretty much what you'd expect ‒ noisy, overlong, wall-to-wall CG effects and arcane superhero lore ... Yes, it's all fairly formulaic, but on a Wow! scale never before experienced."
the-avengers,Kevin A. Ranson,False,"May 12, 2012","If you only see one movie this year over and over again, it'll probably be this one."
the-avengers,Austin Kennedy,False,"May 12, 2012","I have a feeling that this will be a comfort film for myself and many other film geeks for years to come, just like the Indiana Jones or Star Wars movies."

the-avengers,Rick Marshall,False,"May 10, 2012",The Avengers greatest accomplishment could be this: its ability to make an entire audience feel like children reading their favorite comic for the very first time.
the-avengers,Keith Cohen,False,"May 10, 2012",The movie engages the viewer from a very strong opening sequence through the two bonus scenes included in the closing credits. The nearly two and a half hour running time passes by swiftly and leaves you eagerly awaiting a follow-up sequel.

the-avengers,James Kendrick,False,"May 8, 2012","While the film certainly suffers from gigantism, it is a self-inflicted malady, and for fans of the series it is like manna from heaven."
the-avengers,Michael Burgin,False,"May 8, 2012","While Whedon smartly recognizes how key Downey Jr.'s Stark is to the story, he also allows most all of his cast, heroes and villain, ample opportunities to shine, both in dialogue and action."

the-avengers,Robert Roten,False,"May 7, 2012","It's tough to live up to expectations when expectations are so high, but ""The Avengers"" pulls it off, thanks to the clever writing and directing of Joss Whedon and armies of actors and other artists who made this action extravaganza."
the-avengers,Mark R. Leeper,False,"May 7, 2012","While the film lacks the visual imagination of THOR or the period feel of CAPTAIN AMERICA, it has more of a sense of structures on a huge scale being blown up by even bigger explosions."
the-avengers,Tim Brayton,False,"May 7, 2012",You'd have to be either a real grouch or an inveterate hater of the form to deny that this is by and large some really fine explosion-mongering.

the-avengers,Christopher Long,False,"May 7, 2012","If you dig Thor or Cap or Hulk, please check out the original sources. Support your local comic book shop. You wouldn't have any of these movies without them."
the-avengers,Phil Villarreal,False,"May 6, 2012",The film flows with the momentum of a comic book composed of full-page bleed impact-moment illustrations.
the-avengers,Jules Brenner,False,"May 6, 2012","Our basic love of these characters in such an even distribution of involvement and grand context of good vs evil make for maximum enjoyment of a terrific script carried out with conceptual proficiency and, even, sensitivity."
the-avengers,Steve Crum,False,"May 6, 2012",The trick with 'The Avengers' is to satisfy each superhero's fan base while simultaneously divvying out each hero's scenes in equal portions. Director-screenwriter Joss Whedon has pulled it off with muscle flexing aplomb.
the-avengers,Tony Medley,True,"May 6, 2012","Nothing but 2:20 of special effects and ridiculous fights...it's like all the superheroes are trying out at the Improv to see who can give the best one-liner, and none of them do."

the-avengers,Diva Velez,False,"May 6, 2012","Whedon's obvious love for The Avengers' characters, world and fandom makes for a superhero epic that's packed with exciting action, faithful details for comic fans and his signature off-hand wit. It's pure fun and entertainment."

the-avengers,Matt Brunson,False,"May 5, 2012","The scene-stealer is Ruffalo, who provides Bruce Banner with a soulfulness missing in the portrayals by Bana and Norton. This is also the first film to nail the Hulk, who in 2003 looked like a video blip Gumby and in 2008 seemed shellacked in plastic."
the-avengers,Beth Accomando,False,"May 5, 2012",Whedon's The Avengers does what the best films of this genre do: create a fantasy world that you accept as totally real. And then provides a kick-ass good time as well.

the-avengers,Tony Macklin,False,"May 5, 2012","Although it takes a while to hit its stride, once it does Marvel's The Avengers is a razzle-dazzle, rip-roaring entertainment. Count on The Hulk. Once he erupts, The Avengers soars across the screen with ferocity and style."
the-avengers,Giovanni Fazio,True,"May 5, 2012","Superhero movies -- with their franchises, massive marketing budgets, cross-merchandising synergy and dedication to presenting the same experience every single time -- are nothing if not the Mickey D's of cinema, and I'm sure not lovin' it."
the-avengers,Garth Franklin,False,"May 5, 2012","There may be weightier, deeper or richer films this year - but there probably won't be any that are as much fun."

the-avengers,Eric D. Snider,False,"May 4, 2012",More than compensates for the story's averageness with consistently witty dialogue and a stream of terrific moments.
the-avengers,Kevin Carr,False,"May 4, 2012",a whole roast of awesome wrapped up in bacony awesomeness
the-avengers,Eric Kohn,False,"May 4, 2012",A movie that yells at you and geeks out in equal measures.
the-avengers,Rob Humanick,False,"May 4, 2012",It doesn't have to be a great movie to provide a great experience.
the-avengers,Todd Jorgenson,False,"May 4, 2012",It's the equivalent of a superhero all-star game.
the-avengers,Christopher Orr,False,"May 4, 2012","Ultimately, it all comes back to Whedon: His clear vision for each character and how they might be profitably intermingled; his unexpected knack for action choreography; his funny, tender, immaculately constructed script."
the-avengers,Pete Vonder Haar,False,"May 4, 2012",Hulk is the strongest there is.
the-avengers,John Beifuss,False,"May 4, 2012","'The Avengers' registers in the red on the Nerdgasmatron. It's a witty, action-packed triumph -- entertaining and coherent for newcomers, yet true to the spirit of its source material."
the-avengers,Michelle Alexandria,False,"May 4, 2012",Since Best Picture Oscars are awarded to Producers then the Producers of Marvel's The Avengers deserve a best picture Oscar just for pulling this off. The fact that the movie is freaking amazing is just icing on the cake!
the-avengers,Lori Hoffman,False,"May 4, 2012","Joss Whedon has unleashed a ton of unadulterated popcorn movie fun with his marvelous multi-superhero extravaganza, The Avengers."

the-avengers,Sean P. Means,False,"May 4, 2012","This supermerger comes together into a thrilling action movie with heart and brains, masterfully melded by the superhero you can't see on the screen, director/screenwriter Joss Whedon."
the-avengers,Mike Scott,False,"May 4, 2012","Big, loud, ridiculous and eye-popping, writer-director Joss Whedon's film is an empty-calorie summertime treat that delivers on all that it promises."
the-avengers,Tyler Hanley,False,"May 4, 2012","Adjectives used in some of Marvel Comics' iconic titles from the early 1960s through today -- amazing, fantastic, incredible -- also describe director Joss Whedon's superhero epic The Avengers."
the-avengers,Jeff Meyers,False,"May 4, 2012","As spectacle it's big, stupid fun. Visually it's impressive. For comic geeks it's a wet dream come true. But dramatically it's inert."
the-avengers,Corey Hall,False,"May 4, 2012","In some ways, it feels like the kick-off to the afterparty for a post-Iraq War nation, with a sense of ""mission accomplished"" back-slapping buried beneath all the pyrotechnics."

the-avengers,Jeffrey M. Anderson,False,"May 4, 2012","This movie has it all: gorgeously clear action, humor, suspense and even passion. It's not going too far to guess that no other summer movie will touch it."

the-avengers,Mathew DeKinder,False,"May 4, 2012",The Avengers is everything you would want it to be and is the ultimate summer blockbuster. The movie is thrilling and funny without requiring any intellectual heavy lifting.
the-avengers,Matt Soergel,False,"May 4, 2012","It's at its most lively late in the game, when Hulk finally makes an appearance and gets his simple orders: 'Smash.' Good old Hulk ... Yet the movie's a surprisingly perfunctory affair."
the-avengers,Clay Cane,True,"May 4, 2012","There are also the fans who rage in the comments, as if men in spandex are as serious as war and the economy. Is there a defensive euphoria in seeing your childhood heroes come to life? Is 'The Avengers' a great film? No. Will people love it? Yes!"
the-avengers,Neil Pond,False,"May 4, 2012","If you're looking to stretch your movie-superhero dollar, here's some serious blockbuster bang for your cinema buck."
the-avengers,Rob Thomas,False,"May 4, 2012","I honestly would enjoy watching the Avengers sit around a conference table for two hours trading putdowns and one-liners: ""My Dinner With Thor."" And then the action really kicks in. Sweet mercy."
the-avengers,Gary Wolcott,False,"May 4, 2012","The actors get the ensemble approach and - like their characters - put their egos aside, gel and enthusiastically embrace the fun."
the-avengers,Marshall Fine,False,"May 4, 2012","Veined with wit, even as it offers exactly the kind of action that fanboys and normal movie-goers alike want out of something like this."
the-avengers,Kurt Loder,False,"May 4, 2012","Herding all these characters together into one big super-pileup required a gifted traffic cop; and Whedon, as we now see, was the ideal man for the job."
the-avengers,Radheyan Simonpillai,False,"May 4, 2012","It's easy to turn NIck Fury's blind eye to the movie's flaws because at the end of the day The Avengers packs big explosions, bigger personalities and Hulk-sized punch lines."

the-avengers,Grae Drake,False,"May 4, 2012",The movie that all of those iconic comic book characters deserve.
the-avengers,Dave White,False,"May 4, 2012",The job here is to make the Big Bad go away and to save the genre from boredom. The good news is that these heroes won't rest until they've accomplished both. They happily work overtime for you.

the-avengers,Leonard Maltin,False,"May 3, 2012","...there aren't many writer-directors as talented as Joss Whedon. Indeed, it's the writing that sets this film apart from the crowd, in harmony with perfect casting, first-rate visual effects, and other key ingredients."

the-avengers,Amy Biancolli,False,"May 3, 2012","Whedon, a pop-genre magician best known for Buffy the Vampire Slayer, is a master of viewer manipulation - because he never gives up his own seat in the crowd."
the-avengers,Ann Hornaday,False,"May 3, 2012","The performances are so well-pitched in The Avengers, meshing with such vividness and ease, that it's tempting to overpraise the good but not great movie that surrounds them."
the-avengers,Peter Rainer,False,"May 3, 2012",The film is good enough to keep all the Marvel Comics crazed audiences out there deliriously happy while keeping the rest of us earthbound types in moderate thralldom.

the-avengers,Alison Gang,False,"May 3, 2012","It's all rather serious and ominous, yet outlandish and mostly entertaining. Sounds about right for summer, doesn't it?"

the-avengers,Dana Stevens,False,"May 3, 2012","Its primary purpose is not to explore or subvert the superhero movie, but to lay the groundwork for more of them."
the-avengers,Joe Morgenstern,True,"May 3, 2012","A slow start, a single star performance surrounded by indifferent acting and an onslaught of computer effects that range from seen-it-all-in-""Transformers"" to a whole sky full of spectacular stuff in the midtown Manhattan climax."
the-avengers,Peter Keough,True,"May 3, 2012","What the Avengers really need is something to avenge, some compelling emotion or commitment; rallying the troops with blood-stained collectible trading cards doesn't cut it."
the-avengers,Bob Mondello,False,"May 3, 2012","The banter has zip, the effects are fun, the climactic battle is decently spectacular, and if the 3-D is mostly expendable, there are a few scenes where it adds a nice kick."
the-avengers,Jon Niccum,False,"May 3, 2012","What makes this anticipated film so absorbing is how the heroes' internal battles are often more pronounced than their external ones. And when these troubled people interact, it's electric."

the-avengers,Chris Vognar,False,"May 3, 2012",Whedon knows how to be self-aware without getting overly cute about it. He has fun highlighting each character's neurosis and knows which personalities clash to greatest effect.

the-avengers,Steve Persall,False,"May 3, 2012",The superheroes mashup teased for seven years through five blockbusters is absolutely worth the wait. The Avengers is as brawny and lamebrainy as any comic book movie deserves to be.
the-avengers,Christopher Lloyd,False,"May 3, 2012","The long-awaited superhero supergroup is finally assembled, and their film does not disappoint. It's a smashmouth extravaganza of outsized proportions."

the-avengers,Greg Maki,False,"May 3, 2012","Calling 'The Avengers' the Best Superhero Movie Ever Made is a little overblown, though it easily is Marvel's best outing since the original ""Iron Man"" and more than justifies the years of buildup."
the-avengers,Kevin McCarthy,False,"May 3, 2012",Mark Ruffalo was born to the play The Hulk. There is a ten second epic action sequence that is worth the entire price of admission and every one of your nerd tears! Hulk Smash!

the-avengers,Tom Long,False,"May 3, 2012","There's great entertainment in ""The Avengers"" - big bold, action-filled silliness with just enough human spirit to sell itself. This is a comic book movie done right."
the-avengers,Moira MacDonald,False,"May 3, 2012","It's a first-class production all around, from the acting to the 3-D special effects to the touches of wit throughout. It delivers, in grand style, the thing we demand most from a comic-book movie: fun."
the-avengers,Steven D. Greydanus,False,"May 3, 2012","If The Avengers isn't necessarily the BEST superhero movie ever made, it is unquestionably the MOST superhero movie ever made."
the-avengers,Roger Moore,False,"May 3, 2012","It works because Joss Whedon never loses sight of the fragile humanity of the characters, even in their special effects brawls. It works because somebody finally got The Hulk's blend of rage, guilt and bull-in-a-chandelier-shop fun right."
the-avengers,Roger Ebert,False,"May 3, 2012","""The Avengers"" is done well by Joss Whedon, with style and energy. It provides its fans with exactly what they desire."

the-avengers,Bob Bloom,False,"May 2, 2012","Creating a script that not only lives up to the hype, but fulfills and even exceeds the expectations of fans is no easy task, but Whedon and co-writer Zak Penn have done so - and in a manner that does not give short shrift to any of the major characters."
the-avengers,Kenneth Turan,False,"May 2, 2012","Whedon is the key reason why this $220-million behemoth of a movie is smartly thought out and executed with verve and precision. It may be overly long at two hours, 23 minutes, but so much is going on you might not even notice."

the-avengers,Wesley Morris,False,"May 2, 2012","You don't need to be a ""comic-book person"" to find the set pieces exhilarating. But if you are such a person, or a fan of the movies that comic books turn into, ""The Avengers"" feels like the moment you've been waiting for."

the-avengers,Rick Groen,True,"May 2, 2012","To watch another comic book transformed into another blockbuster is to ""marvel"" at much and to feel nothing - that's a safer bet than the converse, perhaps, which may explain the genre's popularity."

the-avengers,Eric Melin,False,"May 2, 2012","In a shrewd move by writer/director Joss Whedon (no stranger to a directing an ensemble), each superhero is given his or her moment of inner turmoil, a moment of doubt and serious danger, and a moment to shine that spotlights their own unique talent."

the-avengers,Pablo Villaça,False,"May 1, 2012","Se sai melhor ao retratar a interação de seus personagens do que a ação por estes protagonizada, apresentando-se como uma brincadeira inofensiva e inconsequente. Não é uma decepção, é verdade, mas um pouco mais de ambição não lhe teria feito mal."

the-avengers,Peter Canavese,False,"May 1, 2012","It's quite possible that The Avengers has more action than any movie ever made...[but] for all its thrill-ride clutter, The Avengers is just about as simplistic as them fightin'-robot pictures..."

the-avengers,Joshua Rothkopf,False,"May 1, 2012","Whedon, the pop savant responsible for TV's Buffy the Vampire Slayer, straddles the line between sarcastic gab and pulp solemnity like Eli Manning on a fourth-down, go-it-alone jag."

the-avengers,Owen Gleiberman,False,"May 1, 2012","The best thing about The Avengers, a multi-tentpole blockbuster that gathers half a dozen Marvel superheroes and unfurls them on a baddie from another planet, is that it also unleashes them on each other."

the-avengers,Stephanie Zacharek,True,"May 1, 2012",The picture is broken down into narrative chunks that ultimately don't tell much of a story - what you get instead is a series of mini-climaxes held together by banter between characters.
the-avengers,Randy Myers,False,"May 1, 2012",Even those who don't know a Marvel hero from a DC caped crusader will find themselves having a grand time. That's because Whedon manages to tap the inner fanboy and fangirl dormant in us all.

the-avengers,Blake Howard,False,"Apr 26, 2012","The story is epic, but rooted in humanity. The direction is slick and large for the set pieces, but intimate to contextualise the heroes. ""We have a HULK"" of a film and we have Joss Whedon to thank."

the-avengers,Sam Bathe,True,"Apr 26, 2012","It was right the Avengers shouldn't gel right at once, but how that get-to-know-you period is played out in the script gets massively out of hand."

the-avengers,Emanuel Levy,False,"Apr 20, 2012","The Avengers delivers! Considering the challenges and pitfalls of assembling disparate heroes and subplots, the skillfully-helmed movie is an effective balancing act between individual stories and collective goals."

the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special,Matt Rodgers,False,"Dec 16, 2022",The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special is a marked improvement on the last high profile space based seasonal spin-off we were subjected to and can’t help but give you the festive feels for forty minutes.

Like ""Iron Man's"" Robert Downey, Jr., Norton is a former Oscar nominee who brings a wealth of talent to a role one normally wouldn't consider him for. But it's his skills as an actor that lend a human touch to"

the-incredible-hulk,Fred Topel,False,"Jun 13, 2008",I didn't mind the Ang Lee one. I don't think this is any better or worse. It's just another Hulk movie.
the-incredible-hulk,Diva Velez,False,"Jun 13, 2008","Leaning as far away from the dire Ang Lee account as possible, The Incredible Hulk will probably smash bank for its determinedly crowd-pleasing, pure Saturday matinee entertainment value. Iron Man, it ain't, but it's still fun."
the-incredible-hulk,Vic Holtreman,False,"Jun 13, 2008",Hulk Smash!
the-incredible-hulk,Cole Smithey,True,"Jun 13, 2008",Slow pacing and a muted sound production only add to the CGI disaster inflicted on what should have been a believable superhero created with 21st century technology.
the-incredible-hulk,Willie Waffle,False,"Jun 13, 2008","A return to the Hulk we know from the TV show, and it captures the angst of being green. It's not easy being green."
the-incredible-hulk,Adam Fendelman,False,"Jun 13, 2008",Technology has done double-edged duty to the legendary Hulk character. The CGI-created ripped body of nothing remotely reminiscent of Edward Norton blows away Lou Ferrigno's 1978 character -- as long as you don't look him in the face.
the-incredible-hulk,Michael Sragow,False,"Jun 13, 2008","This movie will give true believers their money's worth. It's hit or miss -- yet when a legendary figure like the Hulk hits, the impact is startling, and even when he fans, he generates gale force."
the-incredible-hulk,Wesley Morris,True,"Jun 13, 2008","In their determination to make a reliable action movie, they forgot to make an interesting one."
the-incredible-hulk,Peter Rainer,True,"Jun 13, 2008",A smash-and-slash affair. This probably bodes well for the franchise but ill for those of us who think the world would be a better place with at least one less conflicted comic book antihero glutting the megaplexes.
the-incredible-hulk,Chris Vognar,False,"Jun 13, 2008","It moves well for the most part, it delivers a worthy bad guy, and, in Edward Norton, it has a hero constantly on edge and on the run, a more swaggering and modern version of Bill Bixby's Banner from the '70s TV series."

the-incredible-hulk,Tom Long,False,"Jun 13, 2008","Broad, loud, straight-ahead and raucous, The Incredible Hulk may not be the smoothest or smartest movie ever made, but it sure captures the spirit of its giant green protagonist."
the-incredible-hulk,Kevin Williamson,False,"Jun 13, 2008","If Lee's talky flop was the action, this is simply the opposite -- and pretty close to incredible -- reaction."
the-incredible-hulk,Robert W. Butler,True,"Jun 13, 2008","Part of the problem is the computer-generated Hulk. It's OK in the early going, when the big green guy is mostly hidden by darkness or smoke. But in the light of day he looks cartoonish."

the-incredible-hulk,Rene Rodriguez,False,"Jun 13, 2008","Careful not to repeat the past, The Incredible Hulk does a lot of things Lee's The Hulk didn't: It's lighter and faster-paced, it's funnier and it embraces (instead of ignoring) the 1970s TV series that furthered the character's popularity."
the-incredible-hulk,Joe Neumaier,True,"Jun 13, 2008","The sad truth is, a movie Hulk is less a force of nature and more a pathetic weakling."

the-incredible-hulk,Nick Rogers,False,"Jun 13, 2008","One stupid Hulk movie, now a stupidly entertaining Hulk movie. A franchise reset with zany, boneheaded breathlessness, this is loose, lean, fast, comical, thrilling, loud and as flirtatious with substance as necessary to avoid instant disposability."
the-incredible-hulk,Gina Carbone,False,"Jun 13, 2008","I like him when he's angry ... or is it hungry? Norton is no good-time Downey, but this Hulk smashes the 2003 film. However, I caution the filmmakers and Marvel to be fair to their characters and ..."
the-incredible-hulk,Kimberly Gadette,True,"Jun 13, 2008","Comic book performances trample Norton's attempt at 3D, e.g., Tim Blake Nelson's over-the-top scientist, acting as if he's performing children's theater to a packed matinee of pre-schoolers."

the-incredible-hulk,Steve Crum,True,"Jun 13, 2008","...Adolescent heaven personified with endless, wallopin' fights between WWF-looking steroidians, highlighting a mindless production akin to a widescreen video game. In the oft pounded word of The Hulk himself, 'Grrrrr!'"
the-incredible-hulk,Erik Childress,True,"Jun 13, 2008","If you can clock a feature film by its transformations (25-&-50) style and still wish that you could skip through the commercials in-between, precisely how far removed are you from what's come before."
the-incredible-hulk,Rossiter Drake,True,"Jun 13, 2008","Leterrier and screenwriter Zak Penn dispense with the angst and focus on the smash. The result is a movie that eschews dialogue (or anything resembling an idea, for that matter) in favor of hyper-violent mayhem and unconvincing CGI."

the-incredible-hulk,Peter Howell,True,"Jun 13, 2008",The lack of character shading suggests Marvel Studios went too far in distancing itself from Lee's much-reviled predecessor. Could a better balance between brawn and brains not have been struck?

the-incredible-hulk,Patrick Kolan,True,"Jun 13, 2008","It's a step in the right direction with some top-notch moments, and hardcore fans will still walk away with a giddy smile - but it's not in the same sort of league as Spider-Man 2, Iron Man or Batman Begins."

the-incredible-hulk,Erin Free,False,"Jun 13, 2008","While the CGI battles between The Hulk and Abomination are expectedly clunky, there are enough fun references and strongly crafted scenes to mark The Incredible Hulk as a highly enjoyable, if not quite exceptional, comic book adaptation."
the-incredible-hulk,Kevin McCarthy,False,"Jun 12, 2008","If you are expecting this movie to be Iron Man, you will be disappointed, but it is 1000 times better than the abomination that Ang Lee created back in 2003. No pun intended."

the-incredible-hulk,Peter Sobczynski,True,"Jun 12, 2008","A thudding dull and dunderheaded piece of product that is generally uninteresting to look at, frequently painful to listen to and a constant insult to all the things that Ang Lee accomplished in his take on the material."
the-incredible-hulk,Charles Koplinski,True,"Jun 12, 2008",An Incredible Misfire
the-incredible-hulk,Nell Minow,False,"Jun 12, 2008",There are some terrific action sequences. I particularly liked it when the Hulk used a car broken in two as boxing gloves.

the-incredible-hulk,Michael Phillips,False,"Jun 12, 2008","Incredible overstates it, but The Incredible Hulk finds a viable way to retell an old Jekyll and Hyde story, dating back to the early 1960s and a Cold War that inspired its share of unruly Marvel Comics misfits."
the-incredible-hulk,Joe Morgenstern,False,"Jun 12, 2008","This new production, starring Edward Norton as Bruce Banner, looks a lot better -- sometimes it looks great -- and it's a thunderously efficient enterprise, with a nice surprise at the very end."

the-incredible-hulk,A.O. Scott,False,"Jun 12, 2008",The new movie about Dr. Bruce Banner is called The Incredible Hulk. But let's not get carried away: The Adequate Hulk would have been a more suitable title.

the-incredible-hulk,Dan Lybarger,True,"Jun 12, 2008","The audience at my screening cheered the most loudly when Stan Lee, Ferrigno and characters from other Marvel titles appeared for their cameos. If the movie had worked a little better on its own, the Hulk would have gotten more applause just for himself."
the-incredible-hulk,Jeffrey M. Anderson,False,"Jun 12, 2008","Accomplished B-movie director Louis Leterrier speeds things up and lightens the tone, and actor Edward Norton brings more depth and range to the role."
the-incredible-hulk,Laura Clifford,False,"Jun 12, 2008","""The Incredible Hulk"" isn't as much fun as ""Iron Man"" was, but it doesn't suffer from the roteness that affect so many super hero films either. It gets the job done."

the-incredible-hulk,Steven Rea,True,"Jun 12, 2008","Alas, The Incredible Hulk is no Iron Man, and a brief appearance by a devilishly goateed Tony Stark only serves to remind us of that fact."
the-incredible-hulk,Chris Farnsworth,False,"Jun 12, 2008",Hulk smash? Let's put it like this: He uses police cars as boxing gloves. Yeah. Hulk smash.
the-incredible-hulk,Dustin Putman,True,"Jun 12, 2008",What is so disappointing about the film is how much of a lesser experience it is than Ang Lee's Hulk.

the-incredible-hulk,Alonso Duralde,True,"Jun 12, 2008",Even if there weren't script and performance deficiencies -- and there certainly are -- the big problem with both Hulk movies is that the lead character is an unconvincing CG creation.
the-incredible-hulk,Andrea Gronvall,False,"Jun 12, 2008",There's enough adrenaline pulsating throughout this bang-up Marvel Comics adaptation to erase 2003's Hulk from memory (Ang who?).
the-incredible-hulk,Lawrence Toppman,False,"Jun 12, 2008","A sentimental mixture of thwarted romance, military conniving and brute-on-brute action at the end, as Hulk takes on spike-spined Abomination. If the movie's nowhere near as ambitious as the last Hulk, that's probably to the good."
the-incredible-hulk,Ann Hornaday,False,"Jun 12, 2008","A classic comic-book hero quest that, while not entirely novel, hews to its own rules and conventions with dignity and artfulness."

the-incredible-hulk,Justin Strout,False,"Jun 12, 2008","The Incredible Hulk isn't a work of art, but director Leterrier had the sense to recognize that it wasn't supposed to be art in the first place. His film delivers on something called 'fun'."

the-incredible-hulk,Bill Goodykoontz,False,"Jun 12, 2008","Big, loud, messy and most of all fun, The Incredible Hulk offers more evidence that, when done right, the comic-book hero story can indeed be, well, super."

the-incredible-hulk,Rebecca Murray,False,"Jun 11, 2008",[Edward Norton's] take on Bruce Banner is on par with Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman and Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark/Iron Man.
the-incredible-hulk,Owen Gleiberman,False,"Jun 11, 2008","The audience, in all likelihood, will be so grateful not to see another joyless, inert, pea green dud that it may not mind that The Incredible Hulk is just a luridly reductive and violent B movie -- one that clears a bar that hadn't been set very high."
the-incredible-hulk,Armond White,True,"Jun 11, 2008",It's the crappy summer blockbuster Marvelites probably deserve.

the-incredible-hulk,Orlando Parfitt,False,"Jun 11, 2008","Marvel has managed to shape yet another fine piece of slick, if somewhat disposable action-entertainment. The Incredible Hulk is a less ambitious but more wholly realised and coherent vision of the character than previous versions."

the-incredible-hulk,Jeff Otto,False,"Jun 10, 2008","The ending battle between The Hulk and Abomination is one of the most spectacular and exciting things I've ever seen on screen. If the downtown Los Angeles robot battles of Transformers impressed you, this puts those to shame."
the-incredible-hulk,Nick Schager,True,"Jun 10, 2008",No fondness for crummy old television can obscure the general faintheartedness of this saga.
the-incredible-hulk,Emanuel Levy,False,"Jun 10, 2008","Though uneven and structurally messy, new version is better and more entertaining than Lee's somber take, a summer popcorn movie that favors thrilling action and f/x over plot and characters; it makes you curious to see Norton's longer, more detailed cut."

thor-love-and-thunder,Sarah Vincent,False,"Aug 16, 2023",In a deft twist on class war – the gods bleed gold – Thor must confront his privilege and make amends for other gods’ failures to keep promises.
thor-love-and-thunder,Serena Seghedoni,True,"Jul 31, 2023","Despite its great acting, score and worldbuilding and epic character moments, Thor: Love and Thunder feels like one continuous joke that doesn’t land."
thor-love-and-thunder,Hector A. Gonzalez,True,"Jul 29, 2023",No spark or brio in its romantic affairs or CGI-filled action sequences... frustratingly one-note comedic panderings undercut any attempt at developing an emotional story arc.
thor-love-and-thunder,Manuel São Bento,False,"Jul 25, 2023","A bittersweet story about finding peace and love in suffering and pain, without forgetting the necessary thunderous action that reaches its best level in a long sequence surrounded by a breathtaking black-and-white color palette."
thor-love-and-thunder,Zach Pope,False,"Jul 25, 2023",Romantic action comedy you need this summer! An action packed hilarious but also poignant film on change! Taika Wrote a wonderful story that I just fell head over heels for!
thor-love-and-thunder,Tina Kakadelis,True,"Jul 24, 2023",The film’s final scene explains the rationale for the film’s title and shows a glimpse of a different path Love and Thunder could’ve taken. A path that would have been more fit for Waititi’s vision of an 80s romance adventure hijinks-filled movie.
thor-love-and-thunder,Gissane Sophia,False,"Jul 23, 2023","Thor: Love and Thunder is gorgeously shot, chaotically executed, tonally inconsistent at times, and yet a joy ride even when it pushes deeper into the cruelties of life."
thor-love-and-thunder,Pramit Chatterjee,True,"Jul 20, 2023","Thor Love and Thunder is one of the worst movies of the year. From the first frame to the last, it’s unengaging, insipid, and tedious."
thor-love-and-thunder,Keshav Kant,False,"Jul 20, 2023","With one of the shortest runtimes we’ve seen from Marvel in a while at only 119 mins, the much-awaited Thor: Love and Thunder is the definition of here for a good time, not a long time!"

thor-love-and-thunder,Wesley Lovell,False,"Feb 6, 2023","Therein lies Thor: Love and Thunder‘s biggest issue, its inability to balance tone and spectacle."
thor-love-and-thunder,William Jones,True,"Jan 9, 2023","Thor: Love and Thunder's editing routinely works against Taika Waititi's film, often undoing the emotional work the film is attempting to deliver."
thor-love-and-thunder,Joseph Garcia,True,"Jan 5, 2023","Taika Waititi and Chris Hemsworth leaned heavily into the more goofy aspects of Thor: Ragnarok. Thor: Love and Thunder piles on the jokes, bathos and stupidity until the film feels more like a parody of the MCU rather an addition to it."
thor-love-and-thunder,Eric Marchen,True,"Dec 10, 2022","I’m laying down the hammer a bit more harshly because somewhere hidden in this messy pastiche to 80s fantasy movies is an adventure worthy of the gods. Unfortunately, hilarity and humanity fail to harmonize in Thor: Love and Thunder."
thor-love-and-thunder,David Hogan,False,"Nov 23, 2022",Overall a fun time but not the big blockbuster some might be expecting and certainly not recommended if you didn’t find Ragnarok very funny…
thor-love-and-thunder,Christina Newland,True,"Oct 21, 2022","Hemsworth has always been likeable as the smug superhero-god with the Adonis-like physique to match, but the risky attempt to transfer that charisma or to spread it around to other characters is not a gamble that pays off."
thor-love-and-thunder,Murjani Rawls,True,"Oct 19, 2022","'Love and Thunder' will remind you of fantastical adventure films like The Neverending Story, where the impossible can happen. At the same time, it may get in its own way trying to tackle as much as it does."
thor-love-and-thunder,Marriska Fernandes,False,"Oct 19, 2022","It's bonkers in the best possible way. It's silly, laugh-out-loud funny and never takes itself too seriously. For those who have been living on a steady diet of Marvel films, this one delivers hilarious one-liners, jabs and Easter eggs."
thor-love-and-thunder,Brady Langmann,False,"Oct 17, 2022","In Love and Thunder, Waititi pulls off a sneaky, deeply cool move—one that'll likely go unappreciated."

thor-love-and-thunder,Alan French,False,"Oct 2, 2022","Waititi seems driven to tell a story about Gorr and Jane Foster, allowing Christian Bale and Natalie Portman to outshine their peers. Bale simply outclasses the rest of the cast, appearing obscenely menacing and haunted by grief."
thor-love-and-thunder,Andrew Kendall,True,"Sep 23, 2022","Years after ""Ragnarök"", Waititi seems stuck in a facsimile of that same register to diminishing returns. What was previously fresh air has grown stale and “Love and Thunder"" more dull and and unspectacular. Not quite godlike."
thor-love-and-thunder,Hasitha Fernando,True,"Sep 20, 2022","As a huge fan of Thor: Ragnarök, this film left me bitterly disappointed and to be honest, quite heartbroken since I had such high hopes for it."
thor-love-and-thunder,Richard Trenholm,True,"Sep 20, 2022",Why should we feel anything when clearly none of it matters?
thor-love-and-thunder,Pete Vonder Haar,False,"Sep 16, 2022",What's missing is any freaking hint as to where all this is going. <i>Love and Thunder</i> is the sixth (sixth!) movie in Phase Four of the MCU and we still don't know what the endgame (no pun intended) is.
thor-love-and-thunder,Yasser Medina,True,"Sep 13, 2022","I not only think that this is the worst Taika Waititi's movie, but also one that occupies a privileged place at the top of the Olympus of the most boring of the MCU. [Full review in Spanish]"
thor-love-and-thunder,Rohan Naahar,True,"Sep 10, 2022","Taika Waititi's Thor Love and Thunder was a disappointment of godlike proportions, featuring a villain that deserved a much better film."
thor-love-and-thunder,Dan Buffa,False,"Sep 9, 2022","What makes the film durable and winning is the rare blend of comedy and serious drama weight, which is pushed through by a game cast."
thor-love-and-thunder,John Serba,True,"Sep 8, 2022","As visually memorable as the sequence can be, narratively, it’s wet spaghetti flung at the plaster and wacky-wallwalking its way to the floor."
thor-love-and-thunder,Tom Shone,False,"Aug 24, 2022","... Not just the best Marvel movie yet made, but a bona fide camp comedy classic: fast, bright, gaudy, prickly, antic and fun."

thor-love-and-thunder,Maggie Lovitt,False,"Aug 23, 2022","A refreshing venture back to what the MCU is best at delivering: summer popcorn films. You get exactly what you expect: two hours of laughs, colorful scenery, and thunderous joy."
thor-love-and-thunder,Ron Seoul-Oh,False,"Aug 22, 2022","Hilarious, irreverent and full of crowd pleasing moments. However, there are moments where the story development suffers in favor of the humor, and ultimately the fourth film is not quite as strong as Ragnarok"
thor-love-and-thunder,Jason Escamilla,True,"Aug 21, 2022",Thor: Love and Thunder is merely a subpar love story meshed within a subpar superhero action movie.
thor-love-and-thunder,Cody Leach,True,"Aug 18, 2022",Oh how the mighty have fallen! Taika Waititi was clearly given significantly more freedom here and it is not a good result. The slapstick comedy is way too frequent and makes the film feel like a spoof of it's own characters. It's dumb fun...but not much.
thor-love-and-thunder,Travis Johnson,True,"Aug 18, 2022","Here’s the thing about Thor: Love and Thunder, the fourth solo outing for the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s God of Thunder: pretty much every individual element works on its own, and almost none of it works taken as a whole."
thor-love-and-thunder,Ross Anthony,False,"Aug 9, 2022","This is not an action film with humor, this is a comedy with action. Don't take it too seriously and you'll have a lovely time. Russell Crowe knocks it out of the park."
thor-love-and-thunder,Jared Mobarak,True,"Aug 9, 2022",They should have simply let James Gunn play with Thor in Guardians 3 and given Jane Foster her own Mighty Thor film so as not to relegate her into footnote status. Thank goodness for Bale. [His] grief’s authenticity proves how superficial the rest is.
thor-love-and-thunder,Sameen Amer,True,"Aug 8, 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder is lacking in both love and thunder, and could have used more dramatic tension and more palpable, affecting stakes."
thor-love-and-thunder,Mark Kermode,True,"Aug 3, 2022","The jokes, the catch-phrases, just incredibly tired..."
thor-love-and-thunder,Samuel Leggett Jr.,True,"Aug 3, 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder had a great opportunity with Portman as the new Thor & Bale as the God Killer but they were under utilized. At times this was downright silly, visual effects were not well done, & this was one my least favorite Marvel films to date"
thor-love-and-thunder,Michael A. Smith,False,"Aug 2, 2022",I love me some Taika Waititi!  The Oscar-winning filmmaker has a perfect touch when balancing drama and humor.  And that touch is on full display in “THOR: Love and Thunder.”
thor-love-and-thunder,Dennis Schwartz,True,"Aug 1, 2022",A silly new Thor.
thor-love-and-thunder,Jordan Ruimy,True,"Jul 30, 2022","There’s dry wit throughout this movie, but also a sense of unearned familiarity."
thor-love-and-thunder,Nathaniel Rogers,True,"Jul 29, 2022",The resulting tone is so sloppily winking and unserious that it feels grotesque.
thor-love-and-thunder,Keith Garlington,True,"Jul 29, 2022","I'll say this about Thor: Love and Thunder, it tries a little of everything. Unfortunately it results in a pretty disappointing mess."
thor-love-and-thunder,Cris Kennedy,False,"Jul 29, 2022",Hemsworth is a dream - he really understands his own strengths as a performer and as a thing to be objectified.
thor-love-and-thunder,Matt Neal,False,"Jul 29, 2022",The idea that Waititi has made the Thor films throwaway comedic fluff is nonsense.
thor-love-and-thunder,Rob Hunter,True,"Jul 28, 2022","Is Thor: Love and Thunder a bad film? I don’t know, but maybe it’s time to reevaluate 2013’s Thor: The Dark World as the franchise’s weakest entry…"
thor-love-and-thunder,Sean Chandler,True,"Jul 28, 2022","There's plenty of great ideas here, but the movie plays too much as a comedy to take any of it seriously."
thor-love-and-thunder,Nicki Dusse,True,"Jul 28, 2022","""I feel like this movie was the maturation of Thor because you saw and understood why he went through his depressive states in Infinity War/Endgame. As the movie progresses you see that his happiness is truly based on the love he has missed."" Naturally Na"
thor-love-and-thunder,Justin Brown,False,"Jul 28, 2022",I thought it was fun but it definitely was way too silly to take the Gorr storyline more seriously. I wish we had seen more of Gorr actually butchering gods.
thor-love-and-thunder,Brandon Collins,True,"Jul 28, 2022",This felt like a chore to get through it. Cinematography was the best aspect of this film. The humor got redundant very quickly...
thor-love-and-thunder,Emmanuel Báez,False,"Jul 28, 2022",Thor: Love and Thunder is both a classic Thor adventure and a middle-age crisis comedy (if that exists within the context of a god's lifespan). [Full review in Spanish]
thor-love-and-thunder,Kevin A. Ranson,False,"Jul 26, 2022","Falling short in giving real weight to any threats to overcome, the fifth Thor film settles into a story about love, loss, and sacrifice that every viewer can relate to while still wallowing in mandatory spectacle."
thor-love-and-thunder,Peter Canavese,True,"Jul 24, 2022","Too much to handle in less than two hours and feels simultaneously lazier and more overwrought than earlier entries, but an effective escapist event nonetheless."
thor-love-and-thunder,Filipe Freitas,True,"Jul 23, 2022",This Thor flick is the compendium of all things that should not be done when it comes to superhero movies.
thor-love-and-thunder,Steve Erickson,True,"Jul 22, 2022","Many critics have noted the bloodlessness and sexlessness of the MCU. Thor: Love and Thunder seems self-conscious about the latter, while doing little to change it."

thor-love-and-thunder,Edwin Arnaudin,False,"Jul 21, 2022",One of the best MCU films yet.
thor-love-and-thunder,Vincent Mancini,True,"Jul 21, 2022","Taika Waititi seems to think he can carry us through a ludicrous story on the strength of a performative comedian’s confidence alone, but it’s just too transparent."
thor-love-and-thunder,Eileen Jones,True,"Jul 21, 2022",It seems to be trying hard and only succeeding part of the time. It could be Waititi is just getting tired.
thor-love-and-thunder,Rendy Jones,True,"Jul 20, 2022","The egregious storyline given to Natalie Portman’s Dr. Jane Foster in “Thor: Love and Thunder” is the latest example of the MCU doing its heroines so, so wrong."
thor-love-and-thunder,Matt Conway,True,"Jul 20, 2022",Love and Thunder trips over its ambitions in a bloated and conceptually underbaked sequel.
thor-love-and-thunder,Sarah Marrs,False,"Jul 19, 2022",It’s the pure heart of Thor—and Thor—and their story that saves Thor: Love and Thunder from its own excesses.
thor-love-and-thunder,Steven Redgrave,False,"Jul 18, 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder is a solid addition to the MCU, filled with laughs and thrills, but it ironically struggles with its villain and identity, just as Thor seems to."

thor-love-and-thunder,Matt Brunson,False,"Jul 16, 2022","Despite its ample faults, the film nevertheless earns a modest recommendation, albeit one with more reservations than beachfront hotels during Spring Break."
thor-love-and-thunder,Sara Clements,False,"Jul 16, 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder contains that same vigor Waititi brought to Thor: Ragnarok, creating a film that’s a visually stunning blast with ‘80s rock flavor. However, its biggest flaw is the overuse of his schtick in trying to recreate Ragnarok's success."
thor-love-and-thunder,Tim Brayton,True,"Jul 16, 2022","One of the most shockingly erratic, all-over-the-place movies that Marvel Studios has ever produced."
thor-love-and-thunder,Matthew Jackson,False,"Jul 16, 2022","It doesn’t always succeed, but while it never quite lives up to the power of its predecessor, Thor’s fourth solo outing does it at least remind you why you love the guy in the first place, and makes you glad he stuck around this long."
thor-love-and-thunder,Mark McPherson,False,"Jul 16, 2022","While not the worst Thor film, Love & Thunder has a lot of potential in its fantasy adventure but rarely rises to become a worthy sequel to its superior predecessor."

thor-love-and-thunder,Victoria Luxford,False,"Jul 15, 2022","Ending on a sweet note, Thor Love and Thunder delivers the visual spectacle fans will be hoping for and, in Portman, another fantastic female hero. However, all the hair metal in the galaxy can’t disguise a franchise that has begun to repeat itself."
thor-love-and-thunder,Adam Kempenaar,True,"Jul 15, 2022","For a movie seemingly made with the sole purpose of inserting as many goofy gags per minute as possible while employing a healthy dose of vivid colors and rousing GNR hits, Love and Thunder is shockingly lethargic."
thor-love-and-thunder,Robert Roten,False,"Jul 15, 2022","It is a love story about selfishness versus selflessness. The struggle between these two impulses is the very same struggle that is at the heart of what is going on in America, and the rest of the world. It could hardly be more relevant."
thor-love-and-thunder,David Nusair,True,"Jul 15, 2022","...segues into a predictably overstuffed narrative that contains far too many larger-than-life, special-effects-heavy action interludes..."
thor-love-and-thunder,Matt Hudson,False,"Jul 15, 2022","Despite its inconsistencies throughout, Love and Thunder still crackles with enough verve and energy to remain an entertaining addition to the franchise even if it doesn’t feel as vital."
thor-love-and-thunder,Sarah Knight Adamson,False,"Jul 15, 2022","Taika Waititi’s “Thor: Love and Thunder” is a triumph to behold, staying true to the tongue-in-cheek humor with solid themes of love and family—it’s one of Marvel’s strongest films to date."
thor-love-and-thunder,Simon Miraudo,True,"Jul 15, 2022",It's the seafood extender of Marvel movies.
thor-love-and-thunder,Ray Pride,False,"Jul 15, 2022","A grandiloquent goof...  Tee-hee, giggle-giggle from the get-go, and that’s all right: Taika Waititi is the filmmaker most disrespectful of the goings-on in the self-serious, overstuffed conversation pit of the larger Marvel Comic Universe."
thor-love-and-thunder,Joshua Polanski,False,"Jul 14, 2022","While satisfying viewing experiences are subjective and dependent on the individual watching, the stylistic risks and occasionally relatively daring tonal departures should be a welcome guest for all viewers."
thor-love-and-thunder,Tony Baker,False,"Jul 14, 2022","I think it's a good MCU film. It's different, it's wild, it's crazy, and I liked it."
thor-love-and-thunder,Hannah Brown,False,"Jul 14, 2022",[Portman] is engaging and credible in her action scenes. She seems to be having fun and it is fun to watch her.

thor-love-and-thunder,Theolin Tembo,False,"Jul 14, 2022","For those expecting a grandiose story with stakes as equal to Thor: Ragnarok, this movie will fall short, but if you go in just expecting an enjoyable film that the family can laugh along with, then this film will certainly deliver."
thor-love-and-thunder,Beth Accomando,True,"Jul 14, 2022","Love and Thunder flies off in multiple plot directions, never quite making any one of them feel complete. The end result is enjoyable to watch because the characters are such good company, but the story’s a mess."
thor-love-and-thunder,Nandini Ramnath,False,"Jul 14, 2022",It’s more Pirates of the Caribbean than a Marvel spinoff. There are visually splendorous set pieces...

thor-love-and-thunder,Juanma Fernández París,False,"Jul 13, 2022","The best movie out of Marvel Studios in the last two years, the most fun and ingenious since the first Guardians of the Galaxy, and certainly the best cinematic offer from the titular protagonist. [Full review in Spanish]"
thor-love-and-thunder,Michael Nordine,True,"Jul 13, 2022",Scene after scene of potential gravitas is undercut by Waititi’s need to remind us at every turn how clever he is.
thor-love-and-thunder,Maxance Vincent,True,"Jul 13, 2022","The film is an aesthetic and storytelling mess from beginning to end, never knowing exactly what it wants to achieve while hindering most of its emotionally investing moments in favor of unfunny and irritating jokes."
thor-love-and-thunder,Lauren Coates,False,"Jul 13, 2022","hor: Love and Thunder is an action-packed rip-ride of a marvel flick, whose clunky exposition isn’t enough to detract from the heartfelt central story and the (long overdue) focus on Jane Foster."
thor-love-and-thunder,Allen Adams,False,"Jul 13, 2022","Balancing a plot laden with god murder and child abduction and an irreverent joke- and gag-driven spirit isn’t easy, but this film is successful far more than it isn’t at doing just that. All in all? Pretty mighty."
thor-love-and-thunder,Jordan Hoffman,True,"Jul 13, 2022",[Y]ou may feel as if [Taika] Waititi’s hammer is hitting you over the head.
thor-love-and-thunder,Dana Barbuto,False,"Jul 13, 2022","It also has a star in Chris Hemsworth who gives it his all, with a cheekier-than-usual (wink, wink) take on the God of Thunder and lots of Guns ‘N Roses.  Welcome to the Jungle indeed."
thor-love-and-thunder,Chris Sawin,False,"Jul 13, 2022",Thor: Love and Thunder is mostly just a brightly colored filler episode that will likely be forgotten about like most of the Thor franchise.
thor-love-and-thunder,Renuka Vyavahare,False,"Jul 12, 2022",Taika Waititi's mind is a fascinating place to be in. Only he can take you through Thor's dad bod-God bod-sad bod journey.

thor-love-and-thunder,Devesh Sharma,False,"Jul 12, 2022",Perhaps this change in direction is Waititi’s way of remaining Marvel that they’ve been taking themselves too seriously and it’s time to do something new.

thor-love-and-thunder,TK Burton,True,"Jul 12, 2022","There are things that make the film funny, but they don’t make the film good. Too often, Love and Thunder feels like a series of skits, peppered with cameos by actors from Waititi’s other projects."
thor-love-and-thunder,Sandie Angulo Chen,False,"Jul 12, 2022","Director Taika Waititi can't quite recreate the alchemic chemistry of Ragnarok in this serviceable but less exciting sequel, partly because Jane and Thor's romance doesn't spark."
thor-love-and-thunder,Rich Cline,False,"Jul 12, 2022","The weight of the film is carried by the charismatic cast, each of whom is adept at comedy, drama and action. If only filmmaker Taika Waititi had added an edgy bite to raise stakes and deepen themes."

thor-love-and-thunder,Sarah Gopaul,False,"Jul 12, 2022","In spite of some pretty dark moments and a sullen subplot, the movie retains a sense of humour that, in turn, evens out the tone of the overall picture, which leans more heavily on slapstick and over-the-top occurrences."

thor-love-and-thunder,Christopher Machell,True,"Jul 12, 2022","Waititi’s follow-up has all the makings of the God of Thunder’s best adventure yet. Sadly, Love and Thunder proves that it’s possible to have too much of a good Thor."
thor-love-and-thunder,Amy Nicholson,False,"Jul 11, 2022","I was really compelled by the ideas Taika Waititi was teasing in this film, but the actual style of it -- the eagerness to please -- made me take a step back from everything. [But] what he's discussing is really smart."

thor-love-and-thunder,Erik Kain,False,"Jul 11, 2022","If you’re looking for a fun, lighthearted action rom-com with a likable lead and plenty of laughs, Thor vs Gorr with a side of Korg is an enjoyable two-hour diversion. Nothing more, nothing less."
thor-love-and-thunder,Rafer Guzman,True,"Jul 11, 2022","Where ""Ragnarok"" poked irreverent fun at its genre, ""Love and Thunder"" feels geared toward the faithful, packed with the kind of cutesy asides and knowing winks that tend to exasperate outsiders."
thor-love-and-thunder,Victoria Alexander,True,"Jul 11, 2022",Thor has been emasculated and is a co-star in his movie. It’s rote work for Hemsworth.
thor-love-and-thunder,Nick Hasted,False,"Jul 11, 2022","In a franchise system which mostly exploits auteurs, Waititi’s Thor Universe is proudly personal. This cosmic comedy about love recalls how exhilaratingly imaginative superhero stories can be."
thor-love-and-thunder,Grant Rollings,False,"Jul 11, 2022","Even what could be scary scenes, such as the kidnap of a bunch of children, are given a light touch. That robs Bale’s murderous villain of his threat."

thor-love-and-thunder,Kylie Cheung,False,"Jul 11, 2022","Hopefully the rest of the MCU’s Phase 4 will take a page from Love and Thunder by focusing more on relationships...And, please god(s), may future Marvel movies strive to out-gay this one."
thor-love-and-thunder,Kelechi Ehenulo,True,"Jul 11, 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder falls short of expectations. It’s a wild, entertaining mixed bag of a ride that gets lost in the punchline. Taika’s cosmic epic brings plenty of love, but lacks patience with its story to feel the depth of its impact."
thor-love-and-thunder,Daniel M. Kimmel,False,"Jul 11, 2022",Waititi has an uncanny knack of mixing unexpected humor with serious drama and emotional truth.
thor-love-and-thunder,Carson Timar,True,"Jul 11, 2022",Thor: Love and Thunder is a dull and boring cinematic adventure that lacks any of the magic or heart of Waititi's previous MCU outing.
thor-love-and-thunder,Noah Berlatsky,False,"Jul 10, 2022","Waititi wants you to know that when you’re scared or alone, he’ll show up in that rocky CGI face and tell you about some awesome space Vikings."
thor-love-and-thunder,Michael Burgin,True,"Jul 10, 2022",A movie significantly more flawed than its franchise predecessor yet more fun than anything we’ve seen in Phase 4 thus far.
thor-love-and-thunder,Wendy Ide,True,"Jul 10, 2022","There are moments in Love and Thunder when the film feels like a $185m megaphone, dedicated solely to amplifying the voice of Taika Waititi."
thor-love-and-thunder,Alci Rengifo,False,"Jul 10, 2022","After such an overload of serious-minded, intricately interconnected movies, “Thor: Love and Thunder” brings back a sense of humor to the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
thor-love-and-thunder,Abbie Bernstein,False,"Jul 10, 2022",People who’ve enjoyed previous outings with the god of thunder should be happy with this one.
thor-love-and-thunder,James Hanton,False,"Jul 10, 2022","With more heartache and drama than any Thor film to date, this is vintage Waititi and a welcome return to form for phase four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
thor-love-and-thunder,Jessie Gender,False,"Jul 10, 2022","While Chris Hemsworth continues honing his comedic chops as Thor and the film remains consistently entertaining, those hoping Taika Waititi would breathe new life and excitement into the growing Marvel fatigue of Phase 4 will be disappointed."
thor-love-and-thunder,Valerie Complex,False,"Jul 9, 2022","Taika Waititi seems to be still finding his footing with this franchise, and it may take him directing another film to find the right balance for these Asgardian heroes."
thor-love-and-thunder,Paul Salfen,False,"Jul 9, 2022","""Overall, it's a rare two hour Marvel romp that doesn't take itself too seriously, gives us a burst of nostalgia, and quite a bit to ooh and ahh over as we stuff our faces with popcorn."
thor-love-and-thunder,Nestor Bentancor,True,"Jul 9, 2022","Thunderous visuals and an electrifying Christian Bale elevate the film, but the excessive technicolor silliness, tone swings, and a lack of a plot make the experience exhausting."
thor-love-and-thunder,John McDonald,False,"Jul 9, 2022","Although Thor is the centre of the story, he is such an incorrigible nitwit one begins to despair for the universe."
thor-love-and-thunder,Leonard Maltin,True,"Jul 9, 2022","Everyone is entitled to a misfire now and then, and that includes the gifted Kiwi performer and filmmaker most responsible for Thor: Love and Thunder. It’s a scattered affair that, at a certain point, is played as out-and-out comedy"
thor-love-and-thunder,Nick Schager,True,"Jul 9, 2022",Waititi's Marvel superhero sequel to 'Thor: Ragnarok' features an imposing new villain in Christian Bale but is too crammed with one-liners and glitzy set pieces.
thor-love-and-thunder,Andrea Chase,False,"Jul 9, 2022","As silly as the oversized screaming goats that punctuate the action, but it’s a greatly elevated silly."
thor-love-and-thunder,Rosa Parra,False,"Jul 9, 2022","Bale's performance is the standout of this film. But ultimately ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" is an overly vivid and tonally uneven comedy filled with unearned moments that comes nowhere near its predecessor"
thor-love-and-thunder,Anupama Chopra,True,"Jul 9, 2022","A tender love story, a solid villain, a spaceship pulled by goats -- Taika Waititi has packed a lot into the latest addition to the MCU. Unfortunately, it's not enough."
thor-love-and-thunder,Saibal Chatterjee,False,"Jul 9, 2022",It certainly helps that the actors driving the movie know their onions inside out and bring to the table a degree of natural flair.
thor-love-and-thunder,Robert Denerstein,False,"Jul 9, 2022",Waititi knows how to be silly without being stupid.
thor-love-and-thunder,Brandon Avery,False,"Jul 9, 2022","I wouldn't be surprised if news dropped about the ton of footage left on the cutting room floor. Everything amazing about the film was cut short from the runtime, but still was a fun Marvel ride that I'm eager to see again."
thor-love-and-thunder,David Gonzalez,False,"Jul 8, 2022","Love & Thunder electrifies with laughs, love, and tragedy. Waititi takes the God of Thunder on his most personal and emotional journey that is both rich and sublime."
thor-love-and-thunder,Kevin Carr,False,"Jul 8, 2022",Taika Watiti delivers another hilarious and thrilling cosmic adventure that also has a surprising amount of poignancy and heart.
thor-love-and-thunder,Candice McMillan,True,"Jul 8, 2022","While the blending of genres has become a tentpole for modern superhero movies, Love and Thunder is a vampire, sucking all the life from each genre it emulates."
thor-love-and-thunder,Steph Cozza,False,"Jul 8, 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder is a comedy first, and a superhero movie second."
thor-love-and-thunder,Mike McGranaghan,True,"Jul 8, 2022",Thor: Love and Thunder is the movie that turns the Marvel Cinematic Universe into a great big joke.
thor-love-and-thunder,Kristy Puchko,True,"Jul 8, 2022","Love and Thunder is raucous, flashy, and vacuous, not satisfyingly fun."
thor-love-and-thunder,André Hereford,False,"Jul 8, 2022",The mighty Avenger ditches his doldrums to join erstwhile love Jane in the funhouse adventure 'Thor: Love and Thunder.'
thor-love-and-thunder,Ruth Maramis,False,"Jul 8, 2022",Far from being the GOAT of the MCU despite the shrieking chariot-pulling goats. Bloated with CGI & the novelty of Taika Waititi's brand of humor seems to be wearing off. The rockin' soundtrack gets high marks & Christian Bale is the clear MVP as Gorr.
thor-love-and-thunder,George Wu,True,"Jul 8, 2022","Waititi clearly put a lot of love into Thor: Ragnarok. That is missing from Thor: Love and Thunder, which feels more like slapdash product."
thor-love-and-thunder,Phil Villarreal,False,"Jul 8, 2022","It may not make a heck of a lot of sense, but don't be surprised if you're smiling too much to notice."
thor-love-and-thunder,Valerie Kalfrin,False,"Jul 8, 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder has the verve of a glam-rock musical, full of Guns N’ Roses riffs, bursts of lightning, and technicolor travels along the Rainbow Bridge. But its core is the tender idea that we all crave and need love, even if it hurts to lose it."
thor-love-and-thunder,John Wenzel,True,"Jul 8, 2022","It's saturated and loud and beautiful to behold, but its ungainly plot and willingness to slip into every tonal alley leaves it searching for a point."
thor-love-and-thunder,Ryan Syrek,True,"Jul 8, 2022","“Love and Thunder” is nowhere near an unpleasant flop so much as it is just half-inert. Expecting the exhilaration of “Ragnarok” would be unfair, but nobody should ask for Diet Coke and get a glass of ranch dressing. Oh, we’ll still drink it…"
thor-love-and-thunder,Lauren Bradshaw,False,"Jul 8, 2022","Fun, hilarious, and silly, Taika Waititi once again makes an entertaining Marvel film in Thor: Love and Thunder. Bale may be the scariest-looking villain yet."
thor-love-and-thunder,Christopher Lloyd,False,"Jul 8, 2022","A fun, gleefully goofy entry in the MCU that places a premium on laughs and skimps on characterization. Love the '80s homage."
thor-love-and-thunder,M.V. Moorhead,False,"Jul 8, 2022","As in 2017's delightful Thor: Ragnarok, Waititi plays this material for goofy laughs; there are cosmic gags here worthy of Melies. It's very silly, but unlike Ragnarok, it isn't only silliness."
thor-love-and-thunder,Doug Walker,True,"Jul 8, 2022","When it's a 'Thor' movie, it's great! When it's a 'Minions' movie, it's obnoxious."
thor-love-and-thunder,Ian Thomas Malone,True,"Jul 8, 2022","There is no imperative driving Love and Thunder beyond its obligations to the gods of content, an empty shell of a film covered up with endless jokes and attractive people standing in front of exceedingly bland green screens."
thor-love-and-thunder,Carmen Phillips,False,"Jul 8, 2022","There's a lot of fun in Thor: Love and Thunder. It's a worthy successor to Thor: Ragnarok (my favorite, and despite what Natalie Portman claimed, still the gayest Thor movie)."
thor-love-and-thunder,Micheal Compton,False,"Jul 8, 2022","This film can be best described as fun, with Chris Hemsworth and the rest of the cast able to convey Waititi’s trademark subversive humor in mostly entertaining fashion."
thor-love-and-thunder,Dana Han-Klein,False,"Jul 8, 2022","Taika continues to prove his brilliant understanding of the idiosyncrasies of friendships, envy, and of course hilarity. There's a wealth of parental warmth to the film. He's the GOAT. Be warned it can't bring the novelty of reinvention that Ragnarok did."
thor-love-and-thunder,Radheyan Simonpillai,False,"Jul 8, 2022",[Taika Waititi] wants you to know that he’s the kid with red crayon scribbling all over a genre that is often more stone-faced than it should be.
thor-love-and-thunder,Collin Garbarino,False,"Jul 8, 2022","Despite being a movie about magic hammers and space gods, Thor: Love and Thunder is a very funny film in which we see Thor wrestle with very human problems."
thor-love-and-thunder,Alison Willmore,True,"Jul 8, 2022","[Gorr] does seem to be onto something — the gods, floating obnoxiously above the fray of mortal concerns, kind of suck. Unfortunately, this movie is about one of them."
thor-love-and-thunder,Javier Ocaña,True,"Jul 8, 2022","In this instance, Waititi has failed in modulating tone... The gravity of some of the characters and the effervescence of others ail each other in the worst way. [Full review in Spanish]"
thor-love-and-thunder,Lisa Johnson Mandell,False,"Jul 8, 2022","You know how some superhero movies take themselves so seriously you long for a moment of comic relief? Well here I longed for a moment of dramatic relief. But Taika Waititi gets away with the frantic pacing, always delivering tons of good, gregarious fun."
thor-love-and-thunder,Louisa Moore,True,"Jul 8, 2022","It’s never a good sign when a highly anticipated, mega-budget summer superhero movie is so dull that you’d rather take a nap."
thor-love-and-thunder,Piers Marchant,False,"Jul 8, 2022","It can be rip-roaring fun, but it doesn't seem to sail anywhere in particular."
thor-love-and-thunder,Patrick McDonald,False,"Jul 8, 2022","I guess Thor is now Marvel Universe comic relief. The Screaming Goats, the face-off between inanimate objects and Zeus is all funny, but why does the main villain disappear for so long? Regardless, it's popcorn entertainment and delivers the goods. Aiyee!"
thor-love-and-thunder,Jonathan W. Hickman,False,"Jul 8, 2022","This film has funny bits, goofy moments (the goats are wacky fun), a kicking jukebox soundtrack, and a worthy villain. Still, it lacks the cohesive elements that convincingly pull the story together."
thor-love-and-thunder,Mark Meszoros,False,"Jul 8, 2022","Prioritizing the yuks while telling a story in which a villain called Gorr the God Butcher is, as you would expect, executing gods but also kidnapping children is a tricky business."
thor-love-and-thunder,John Urbancich,False,"Jul 8, 2022","The best dark moments in Waititi's quick-moving adventure finally arrive later, during an eerie black-and-white sequence that brings Hemsworth's ""Space Viking"" into a kind of barren, yet mind-bending Twilight Zone. If only all of it landed so neatly."
thor-love-and-thunder,Matt Rodriguez,False,"Jul 8, 2022","While not as game-changing as Ragnarok, Love and Thunder once again shines brightly with a flashy confidence as it takes audiences on a wildly entertaining journey of love and adventure."
thor-love-and-thunder,Alex Bentley,True,"Jul 8, 2022","Some may take the funny parts of Thor: Love and Thunder and give it more credit than it actually deserves. But its uninspired story, a villain who makes little sense, and other missteps show that the MCU has a long way to go before it regains its mojo."
thor-love-and-thunder,Jim Judy,False,"Jul 8, 2022","It's something to be both entertained but also bored, and moved at times when otherwise not engaged one iota. Viewer mileage will likely wildly vary."
thor-love-and-thunder,Johnny Gayzmonic,False,"Jul 8, 2022","It’s as big and bold and vibrant as you’d expect a top-tier comic book film to be and also as shallow, but the spectacle is so strong and the cast so uniformly talented that it all works. This film is peak Himbo Energy and I can dig it."
thor-love-and-thunder,Kurt Loder,True,"Jul 8, 2022",Bringing Russell Crowe in to play Zeus -- in a scene that goes on much too long -- is an idea that must have been hatched during an all-night mead bender.
thor-love-and-thunder,Shikhar Verma,True,"Jul 8, 2022","After doing the tough task of redeeming and frankly diverting the MCU into more fun, frolic end with Thor: Ragnarok, Taika Waititi is back with a tonally inconsistent and empty spectacle that doesn’t just lack laughs, but also lacks levity."
thor-love-and-thunder,Sonny Bunch,True,"Jul 8, 2022","Love and Thunder is also surprising ugly: just flat, bad, obvious CGI backgrounds and greenscreen work that makes the whole thing feel especially weightless."
thor-love-and-thunder,Kevin Brackett,False,"Jul 8, 2022","Waititi leans into the humor he brought with Ragnarok, so if you're looking for more of that - you're in for a fun time."
thor-love-and-thunder,Leo Brady,False,"Jul 8, 2022",It’s much too similar to what came before but there is just enough spark in Thor: Love and Thunder to recreate the electricity.
thor-love-and-thunder,Peter Travers,False,"Jul 8, 2022","It’s barely half as funny, fierce, romantic and thrilling as 2017's ab fab Thor: Ragnarok, but director Taika Waititi and self-mocking  star Chris Hemsworth get such goofball jollies  sending up the usual Marvel bloat that you won’t be able to resist."
thor-love-and-thunder,Jennifer Heaton,False,"Jul 8, 2022","I have no doubt this’ll divide the fanbase as much as Iron Man 3, if not more so, but if you loved that film’s boldness and willingness to take risks, you owe it to yourself to give Thor’s latest classic adventure a whirl."
thor-love-and-thunder,Eddie Harrison,False,"Jul 8, 2022","…the intent is more often to generate laughs than thrills or drama, and that’s welcome…"
thor-love-and-thunder,Katie Smith-Wong,False,"Jul 8, 2022",Waititi’s direction doesn’t buckle from the grandiose and his vision capitalises on a diverse and rich colour palette and grand special effects resulting in some jaw-droppingly gorgeous set pieces.
thor-love-and-thunder,Sarah Ward,False,"Jul 8, 2022","Love and Thunder is equally mischievous and jumbled. It's chaotic in both fun and messy ways. Out in the cosmos, no one can swim, but movies about galaxy-saving superheroes can tread water."
thor-love-and-thunder,A.C. Koch,False,"Jul 8, 2022","Waititi's affinity for goofy characters foisting their awkwardness upon one another makes for a charming twist on the Marvel formula, but in the end not even the gods are powerful enough to survive the steamroller of this cinematic universe."
thor-love-and-thunder,Cory Woodroof,True,"Jul 8, 2022",Thor: Love and Thunder just drags a bit too much ass and gets too distracted by itself to really stand up to snuff. It's not really bad as much as it is just kind of perfunctory. It exists because it has to.
thor-love-and-thunder,Dan Murrell,False,"Jul 8, 2022","It's not bad, but it has the same look & feel as about a dozen Marvel movies & TV shows before it. This may be what Marvel fatigue looks & feels like."
thor-love-and-thunder,Russ Simmons,False,"Jul 8, 2022","While it may be a bit too goofy for its own good, it’s still fun, an entertaining and welcome entry in the series."
thor-love-and-thunder,Jeffrey M. Anderson,False,"Jul 8, 2022","It's an enjoyable effort, not at all hard to like, but it... misses."
thor-love-and-thunder,Brian Eggert,True,"Jul 8, 2022",A movie more interested in ironic laughs than furthering the MCU’s mythology or delivering cohesive behaviors.
thor-love-and-thunder,Dominic Corry,False,"Jul 8, 2022","There are more tangible laughs to be found here than in the vast majority of films of this scale, but this ultimately feels like more of a collection of nice moments than a story that necessarily needed to be told."
thor-love-and-thunder,Jeremy Jahns,True,"Jul 8, 2022",It leans heavy on the comedy to the point where the movie feels like an MCU parody of Thor rather than a Thor adventure and to be honest... the movie ended in a way that i just didn't find fulfilling.
thor-love-and-thunder,James Verniere,False,"Jul 8, 2022",A bit of a letdown after the intoxicating hijinks of Thor: Ragnarok. Hela is way more fun than Jane Foster. Hemsworth and Bale are in two different movies.
thor-love-and-thunder,Nick Johnston,True,"Jul 7, 2022","This wouldn’t matter as much if Love and Thunder were fun to watch unfold, with some of the well-constructed and stylish imagery that Waititi at least brought to the table with Ragnorok or his other films, but it’s a visual mess."
thor-love-and-thunder,Andre Meadows,False,"Jul 7, 2022","Overall, I really like Thor: Love and Thunder. There's a lot of elements in this movie that work really well for me."
thor-love-and-thunder,Kyle Smith,True,"Jul 7, 2022","Though Chris Hemsworth, as usual, has a lot of fun in the title role, the film around him too often strains to provide excitement and laughs."
thor-love-and-thunder,Benjamín Harguindey,True,"Jul 7, 2022","Throughout three movies, Thor and Jane haven't been able to produce enough moments to compile a fast montage of a relationship that blooms and wilts with the caliber of a mediocre rom com. A piddling story of love. Or of thunder. [Full review in Spanish]"
thor-love-and-thunder,MontiLee Stormer,False,"Jul 7, 2022","No one will ever accuse Taika Waititi of deep cerebral epics that are discussed over Turkish coffees in mahogany-lined private libraries, and that’s exactly why we love him."
thor-love-and-thunder,John Lui,False,"Jul 7, 2022","You do not need to watch any show on Disney+ to fully enjoy this one, nor wrap your head around complex cosmologies or multiversal madness."
thor-love-and-thunder,Kristian M. Lin,False,"Jul 7, 2022","These superhero movies keep coming out with their own personalities, and the odd sweetness in this one makes it endearing."
thor-love-and-thunder,Kimberly Reyes,True,"Jul 7, 2022","Coming in at just under two hours (a rarity for any film nowadays, especially a Marvel blockbuster), Thor: Love and Thunder is in too much of a hurry to get from joke to joke at the expense of gradation and character development."
thor-love-and-thunder,Luke Goodsell,True,"Jul 7, 2022","Whenever [Bale's] on screen, the movie is far richer than it deserves to be. But Love and Thunder's schtick is starting to seem more than a little desperate."
thor-love-and-thunder,Mario Alegre,False,"Jul 7, 2022","As Marvel movies continue to wander aimlessly in search of purpose in its post-Endgame phase, Taika Waititi takes that lack of direction and tries to build something light, loveable and fun on top of it. It mostly works. [Full Review in Spanish]"
thor-love-and-thunder,Manohla Dargis,False,"Jul 7, 2022","Waititi’s playfulness buoys “Love and Thunder,” but the insistence on Thor’s likability, his decency and dude-ness, has become a creative dead end."
thor-love-and-thunder,Cary Darling,True,"Jul 7, 2022","Ultimately, “Thor: Love and Thunder” isn’t a bad movie, just a frustratingly disappointing one."
thor-love-and-thunder,Robin Clifford,False,"Jul 7, 2022","So, as a non-fan, I found it entertaining, funny and a little bit somber. Would I watch it again? No, thanks. Am I going to talk to the fans and find out what they think? Absolutely!"
thor-love-and-thunder,Jeremy Aspinall,False,"Jul 7, 2022",Delivers more of a knockabout comedy than a full-throttle action adventure.
thor-love-and-thunder,Marcelo Stiletano,False,"Jul 7, 2022","... Incredibly fun, the best Marvel film since Ant Man and the Wasp (2019), shows magnificently Foster's empowerment journey without the need to cram in an obvious message. [Full review in Spanish]"
thor-love-and-thunder,Jake Wilson,True,"Jul 7, 2022","It’s all a bit Monty Python, a bit Wes Anderson, but mostly reminiscent of the kind of self-mocking TV ad that draws on classical mythology to sell chocolate or get us to switch mobile plans."
thor-love-and-thunder,Christopher Llewellyn Reed,False,"Jul 7, 2022","Add more than a touch of moving pathos at the end and the film delivers enough cinematic goods to justify its place in the Marvel pantheon. Still, somebody needs to edit Waititi, for his own sake and ours."
thor-love-and-thunder,Richard Whittaker,True,"Jul 7, 2022","Love and Thunder resets Thor back to where he was at the beginning of the first film: a vain, greedy, cruel boy. Just with puppy-dog eyes whenever Jane turns up."
thor-love-and-thunder,Richard Crouse,False,"Jul 7, 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder isn’t an all-out action-comedy like Ragnarok. It juggles life-and-death concerns, is rooted in grief and pain, but Waititi’s singular style, Hemsworth’s charm and a heartfelt examination of the pain and pleasure of love is a winner."
thor-love-and-thunder,Nicola Austin,False,"Jul 7, 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder is a weird and wonderful cosmic adventure which truly wears its heart on its sleeve, as the God of Thunder (and company) journey on a charming and surprisingly sentimental quest."
thor-love-and-thunder,Richard Lawson,True,"Jul 7, 2022","The studio has stumbled into what may be the worst film yet in its long line of spectaculars, an erratic and fatally dull morass of limp jokes and aimless plotting."
thor-love-and-thunder,Mick LaSalle,True,"Jul 7, 2022","Most of “Thor: Love and Thunder” is a mess, pleased with itself and tonally everywhere. As bad as one of the better “Pirates of the Caribbean” movies, but that’s still pretty horrible."
thor-love-and-thunder,Sherin Nicole,True,"Jul 7, 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder is as flawed in its logic as the myths it’s based on but, like them, it nevertheless makes a good bedtime story."
thor-love-and-thunder,Jon Negroni,False,"Jul 7, 2022","It’ll toss plenty of lore at the audience but never demand much in the way of thinking. We all get to be Thor for about two hours, essentially."
thor-love-and-thunder,George Simpson,False,"Jul 7, 2022","Taika Waititi delivers a Chris Hemsworth follow-up to Thor Ragnarok every bit as colourful, weird, hilarious and downright entertaining - all with some added heart."
thor-love-and-thunder,Josh Bell,False,"Jul 7, 2022","The variations within the MCU remain minimal, but Love and Thunder finds a fun approach within its limited scope."
thor-love-and-thunder,Pablo O. Scholz,False,"Jul 7, 2022","[Waititi] conjugates comedy, action and adventure. Throw in a Chris Hemsworth comfortable in his Marvel superhero skin and his beloved's return, and well... as the protagonist himself put it: ""You've got a classic Thor adventure.""

thor-love-and-thunder,David Crow,False,"Jul 7, 2022",Bale is phenomenal in this opening and thereafter... but it's a bit like if Heath Ledger's Joker was never allowed to ask someone how he got his scars (and then show them).
thor-love-and-thunder,Rebecca Murray,False,"Jul 7, 2022","The big finale’s worth waiting for through the erratic lead-up. Plus, who doesn’t enjoy screaming goats and a Marvel version of Voldemort?"
thor-love-and-thunder,Chris Hewitt,False,"Jul 7, 2022","""Love and Thunder"" has a goofy streak a mile wide, as if Waititi is letting us know he's fully aware of the ridiculousness of a bunch of muscle-y actors running around in Halloween costumes."
thor-love-and-thunder,Jorge Arturo Mora,True,"Jul 7, 2022",A fast-paced adventure of laughs and soap operas. [Full review in Spanish]

thor-love-and-thunder,Kyle Wilson,False,"Jul 7, 2022",Everything that works brilliantly in the film is all Waititi and so are all the glaring flaws.
thor-love-and-thunder,Tom Santilli,True,"Jul 7, 2022","This is a ramshackle, choppy spoof that would work better if it existed in a vacuum, and not part of an over-arching cinematic universe."

thor-love-and-thunder,Gayle Sequeira,True,"Jul 7, 2022","True to its title, the new Thor film is one part big heart, but the other part is empty spectacle and great noise."
thor-love-and-thunder,Josh Wilding,False,"Jul 7, 2022","Too silly to take seriously, there’s still a lot to love about Thor: Love and Thunder but, unlike Thor: Ragnarok, it’s unlikely to be a movie you’ll fall in love with. Marvel Studios may be developing a quantity over quality issue."
thor-love-and-thunder,Karl Delossantos,False,"Jul 7, 2022",Thor: Love and Thunder is the queerest MCU movie yet.
thor-love-and-thunder,EJ Moreno,True,"Jul 7, 2022","In yet another Thor movie where the character must find himself, at least the supporting cast has something interesting to do here."
thor-love-and-thunder,Matt Singer,False,"Jul 7, 2022",Mighty uneven.
thor-love-and-thunder,Nell Minow,False,"Jul 7, 2022","It is so much fun and often genially goofy, two words that don’t usually apply to superhero movies, that it is satisfyingly entertaining"
thor-love-and-thunder,Dustin Chase,True,"Jul 7, 2022",The latest Thor is a severe thunderstorm warning that only amounts to a passing stray shower of creativity or two.
thor-love-and-thunder,Scott Campbell,False,"Jul 7, 2022","Fittingly for a movie soaked in 1980s hair metal, 'Thor: Love and Thunder' dials things up to way past 11, but not always for the best."
thor-love-and-thunder,Dan Scully,False,"Jul 7, 2022","The filmic equivalent of McDonald’s food: hits the spot in the moment, fades from memory immediately upon completion, and was likely produced using a 3D printer."
thor-love-and-thunder,Akhil Arora,True,"Jul 7, 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder suffers from narrative gaps, wild tonal imbalances, and weightlessness. More importantly, it under-utilises nearly every actor and character at its disposal."
thor-love-and-thunder,Joey Morona,True,"Jul 7, 2022",Waititi teases greatness but the film never kicks into a higher gear as you keep hoping it will.
thor-love-and-thunder,Mark Feeney,True,"Jul 7, 2022","Clearly, Waititi is having a lot of fun with this. It’s just that the viewer isn’t."
thor-love-and-thunder,Emily Zemler,False,"Jul 7, 2022","As he picks up the Norse god’s mantle again in Thor: Love and Thunder, Waititi turns the dial up to 11, creating an off-kilter superhero movie that is equal parts humor and heart."
thor-love-and-thunder,Dana Stevens,False,"Jul 7, 2022","Given the formulaic nature of the Marvel Studios house style, Waititi has crafted a successful if less than world-shaking sequel to his memorable Marvel debut."
thor-love-and-thunder,James Berardinelli,False,"Jul 7, 2022","Thus far, the 2021-22 roster of Disney/Marvel post-pandemic titles has struggled to advance the series beyond Thanos in a meaningful fashion. Although it’s questionable whether Thor: Love and Thunder changes that, it has a helluva lot of fun trying."
thor-love-and-thunder,Richard Roeper,True,"Jul 7, 2022","An allegedly wild and wacky but ultimately disappointing and disjointed chapter in the ongoing story of the God of Thunder, who seems to get more clueless with each passing movie."
thor-love-and-thunder,Luke Walpole,False,"Jul 7, 2022","At times visually expansive and sparkling with Waititi’s infectious comedy, Thor: Love and Thunder nevertheless struggles to recapture lightning in a bottle."
thor-love-and-thunder,Kshitij Rawat,True,"Jul 7, 2022","There was no way Taika Waititi was going to meet sky-high expectations he set with 2017's 'Thor: Ragnarok'. And he does fall way, way short with 'Thor: Love and Thunder'. But the film is not just disappointing, it is also a complete mess."
thor-love-and-thunder,Jorge Rivera Rubio,False,"Jul 7, 2022","Turns up the volume on everything; the humor, the music, the colors and, did I already mention that it has a lot of comedy? Fans of the comic book Thor will have to continue to settle for what is already in the first films. Full review in Spanish."
thor-love-and-thunder,Matt Oakes,True,"Jul 7, 2022","This is what happens when a successful vision is copy-pasted ad nauseam, obliterating what was fresh just a few years back into lazy pastiche."
thor-love-and-thunder,Mark Dujsik,False,"Jul 7, 2022",Thor: Love and Thunder ... remind[s] us that its eponymous superhero is one of the few surviving characters of merit in this expanded series.
thor-love-and-thunder,Josie Melendez,False,"Jul 7, 2022","Even though it has its flaws, Waititi's usual flare makes it enjoyable. Despite feeling like a lot of things happened out of convenience to serve the plot, I had a good time. I guess that's what matters."
thor-love-and-thunder,Rob Dean,False,"Jul 7, 2022",Thor: Love and Thunder is a fun movie with lots of great sequences ... but there’s a sense that Waititi’s ambitions got in the way of a more powerful version of this story.
thor-love-and-thunder,Eric Goldman,False,"Jul 6, 2022",It's clunkier and the humor more hit and miss than Thor: Ragnarok but then it really comes together in the second half and there are parts of this movie that are absolutely stronger and more emotional than Ragnarok.
thor-love-and-thunder,Sara Michelle Fetters,True,"Jul 6, 2022",Thor: Love and Thunder is my least favorite film in the MCU.
thor-love-and-thunder,Jeffrey Harris,False,"Jul 6, 2022","While the film mainly plays as an action-adventure superhero comedy, Waititi can get serious when it counts. Thor’s deep fear makes him a much more well-rounded character and brings his emotional vulnerability to the forefront."
thor-love-and-thunder,Emily Wheeler,True,"Jul 6, 2022",Might as well be called MCU Fatigue: The Movie.
thor-love-and-thunder,Erin Free,False,"Jul 6, 2022","…a rollicking, hard-rocking slab of pure, unadulterated entertainment…"
thor-love-and-thunder,Graeme Tuckett,False,"Jul 6, 2022","There might never be another Endgame, or even another Winter Soldier in this series. But as long as there are films as likeable, engaging and daft as Love and Thunder, I'll keep on watching them."
thor-love-and-thunder,Paul Whitington,False,"Jul 6, 2022","It’s all very enjoyable, but inferior to Ragnarok in two respects. The plot here is a little too thin to carry all the pyrotechnics, and while the humour flowed with giddy ease in Ragnarok, in this likeable sequel it sometimes seems a little forced."
thor-love-and-thunder,Bennett Campbell Ferguson,True,"Jul 6, 2022","[Thor: Love and Thunder] begins with a graceful homage to The Tree of Life and ends with a tear-jerking climax that could have been written by Nicholas Sparks. It’s a gratifyingly weird film, but it isn’t good."
thor-love-and-thunder,Steven Prokopy,False,"Jul 6, 2022","This one feels like a bunch of kids came up with superhero story ideas, and Waititi went along for the ride—it sounds like a cool idea, but the reality is messy and emotionally unconvincing."
thor-love-and-thunder,Erick Estrada,True,"Jul 6, 2022",One more instance to prove that good ingredients don't always make a successful mix. You'd need sensibility and a sense of adventure. Something Marvel can't offer right now. [Full review in Spanish]
thor-love-and-thunder,Lynn Venhaus,False,"Jul 6, 2022","This flashy blend of heroics, heart and humor is sometimes too goofy to be taken seriously, but overall is an inspired take from director Taika Waititi, and that is reason enough to spring extra for the IMAX viewing."
thor-love-and-thunder,Brent McKnight,True,"Jul 6, 2022",A movie you see then immediately begin to forget.
thor-love-and-thunder,Alejandro G. Calvo,False,"Jul 6, 2022",... The comedic elements are way superior to the indigestible epic finale it attempts to accomplish. [Full review in Spanish]
thor-love-and-thunder,Mattie Lucas,True,"Jul 6, 2022",These highlights can't cover up a weak script and a general sense of lethargy that plagues much of the film.
thor-love-and-thunder,David Sims,True,"Jul 6, 2022","Love and Thunder is such a hasty-feeling mess of a movie, it might get the viewer to come around to Gorr's bloodthirsty perspective."
thor-love-and-thunder,Caroline Siede,False,"Jul 6, 2022","""Love and Thunder"" isn’t the same kind of comedic crowdpleaser as ""Ragnarok."" But for those who wanted just a touch more heft back in the ""Thor"" franchise, it’s a worthy installment."
thor-love-and-thunder,Bob Bloom,False,"Jul 6, 2022","'Thor: Love and Thunder' is scattershot, awkwardly jumping around without any apparent cohesion. It hurriedly careens around the cosmos without much thought or depth."
thor-love-and-thunder,Jason Shawhan,False,"Jul 6, 2022","By nature of not actively destroying one of Marvel’s most imaginative achievements of the past few years, Love and Thunder manages to come out ahead of May’s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness in a comprehensive 2022 Marvel ranking."
thor-love-and-thunder,Linda and Al Lerner,True,"Jul 6, 2022","Let’s hope Marvel can move past this misstep and pump up the Love and Thunder with more than a weird Zeus, Hemsworth’s butt and screaming goats. Waititi manages to create moments but not the epic fun comedy adventure we were THOR-oughly hoping for."
thor-love-and-thunder,Danny Leigh,False,"Jul 6, 2022","... Flawless self-awareness, teasing the déjà vu of comic-book movies without ever insulting the audience. This is Waititi's secret sauce."
thor-love-and-thunder,Adam Woodward,True,"Jul 6, 2022","Waititi is too preoccupied with trying to land the same jokes, and he burdens the film with a wishy-washy love story which even by the MCU’s low standards feels shallow and perfunctory."
thor-love-and-thunder,Korey Coleman,False,"Jul 6, 2022","If you like romantic comedies then you're going to love Thor: Love and Thunder. That being said, Marvel's Phase Four feels aimless."
thor-love-and-thunder,Frank Swietek,False,"Jul 6, 2022","A reasonably enjoyable lark...a tonally disjointed picture that doesn’t totally satisfy, but is still one of the better recent MCU efforts."
thor-love-and-thunder,Philip De Semlyen,False,"Jul 6, 2022","There’s loads to enjoy here but after 29 MCU movies, is it time to mix up the formula? A bit more love and a bit less third-act thunder might be nice."
thor-love-and-thunder,Karen Gordon,False,"Jul 6, 2022","With its streak of humanity, Love and Thunder is less broadly comic than Ragnarok, but it still leans heavily on humour, Waititi-style - sly, silly, smart and smart-alecky. And thanks to Waititi’s crisp editing, the film’s comedic timing is impeccable."
thor-love-and-thunder,Hope Madden,True,"Jul 6, 2022",Crushing on his ex while protecting his own skin feels pretty superficial. It’s a slight premise with weak stakes.
thor-love-and-thunder,Michael Phillips,False,"Jul 6, 2022","Do these zigzags and mood swings work? Not entirely. But at its fizziest, the camaraderie among the principals buoys the picture."
thor-love-and-thunder,Joe Passmore,True,"Jul 6, 2022",Marvel's campest entry yet but sadly ventures too far into parody
thor-love-and-thunder,Alan Ng,False,"Jul 6, 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder delivers everything I want in a sit-back-and-relax superhero adventure, which quite frankly is something we need."
thor-love-and-thunder,Katherine McLaughlin,False,"Jul 6, 2022","A highly entertaining MCU entry, charged with cheeky sexual innuendo, silly comedy and cameos that may make you guffaw or cringe."
thor-love-and-thunder,Bob Chipman,False,"Jul 6, 2022",Hard Rock movie ROCKS HARD! Waititi plays the hits (literally!) to deliver a distinctly-2022 rainbow-bubblegum glitterbomb blockbuster that's also stealthily the darkest/saddest 'Marvel joint' in forever. Greece should build a statue to Russell Crowe.
thor-love-and-thunder,Anthony Morris,False,"Jul 6, 2022","You can’t really go far wrong with Hemsworth’s dorky hot guy charisma, or Waititi’s offbeat sense of humour – but you can come away thinking you’ve had enough for a while."
thor-love-and-thunder,Wenlei Ma,True,"Jul 6, 2022","There’s a looseness to the movie that instead of making it fun and riotous, makes it feel jumbled and tiresome."
thor-love-and-thunder,James Mottram,False,"Jul 6, 2022","Less po-faced than past Avengers outings, Love and Thunder may not quite be the “classic Thor adventure” as Korg puts it, but it’s got an emotional core about finding the one you love."
thor-love-and-thunder,Jeanne Kaplan,False,"Jul 6, 2022",Waititi has brought a whole new level of zaniness to THOR: LOVE and THUNDER and it’s awesome.  This franchise has really stepped up its game.
thor-love-and-thunder,David Kaplan,False,"Jul 6, 2022",But new technology may be the real star of THOR: LOVE and THUNDER. It is called The Volume.
thor-love-and-thunder,Tyler Smith,False,"Jul 6, 2022","... chooses to take some thematic risks, telling a story that deepens its character instead of merely winding him up and letting him go."
thor-love-and-thunder,Brent Hankins,False,"Jul 6, 2022","It’s still an enjoyably zany adventure, and Waititi deserves credit for taking some massive stylistic swings, but Thor: Love and Thunder falls well short of recapturing the magic of Ragnarok."
thor-love-and-thunder,Erik Childress,True,"Jul 6, 2022","Did not think it was possible to make a worse Thor film than The Dark World, but Taika Waititi appears to have pulled it off. Love and Thunder now ranks as the low point in the MCU."
thor-love-and-thunder,Tony Stamp,True,"Jul 6, 2022","Almost feels desperate in its attempts to entertain - fights, special effects, and jokes, jokes, jokes. But if everything’s a joke, then does any of it really matter?"
thor-love-and-thunder,Avi Offer,False,"Jul 6, 2022","A funny, entertaining and harmless sci-fi action comedy."
thor-love-and-thunder,Diego Batlle,False,"Jul 6, 2022","The first half is decidedly funny and pulls out all the stops... but it dwindles and in its second half satisfies itself with a pretty generic, conventional duel and romance story with guilt and redemption undertones. [Full review in Spanish]"
thor-love-and-thunder,Scott Tobias,True,"Jul 5, 2022","With every half-written joke, the creative stasis settles in like a stale fart."
thor-love-and-thunder,Todd Gilchrist,False,"Jul 5, 2022","Portman and (especially) Bale contribute more than enough capital-A acting bona fides to lend deeper emotional dimensions to Waititi’s loose, occasionally too-cheerful but always visually adventuresome adaptation of Jason Aaron’s stint on the Mighty Thor"
thor-love-and-thunder,David Poland,False,"Jul 5, 2022","I had a good time throughout the movie. There is a lot of fun stuff. Great actors. And Waititi is a great directorial and comedy force.

But would it make any real difference to the future of the MCU if this film didn’t exist? No. Not really."
thor-love-and-thunder,Katie Walsh,True,"Jul 5, 2022","""Love and Thunder"" proves the bloom is off the rose when it comes to Waititi’s cutesy take on the God of Thunder."
thor-love-and-thunder,Jeffrey Zhang,False,"Jul 5, 2022","Its fleet adventure feels like a tonic, free from multiverses, cameos, and the seemingly requisite MCU buildup to the next “thing.”"
thor-love-and-thunder,Richard Propes,True,"Jul 5, 2022","I certainly never expected to say this about a Taika Waititi film, but the truth is I hated every minute of Thor: Love and Thunder."
thor-love-and-thunder,Lupe Rodriguez Haas,False,"Jul 5, 2022","Taika Waititi’s Marvel follow-up is all over the map as far as tone. That’s not to say it isn't as fun but it takes a more somber turn. Natalie Portman doesn’t disappoint, earning the Mjolnir, and Christian Bale is a worthy villain as Gorr."
thor-love-and-thunder,Lyra Hale,False,"Jul 5, 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder is the best Marvel movie so far for its humor, heart, and unapologetic and brutally honest look at what makes a hero."
thor-love-and-thunder,Randy Myers,False,"Jul 5, 2022",“Thor: Love and Thunder” is one of the most enjoyable MCU romps in a while; one that actually that mirrors the spirit of reading a gone-rogue comic book.
thor-love-and-thunder,Chris Bumbray,False,"Jul 5, 2022","One of the wackiest Marvel movies ever, but also the best all-around film since Avengers Endgame."
thor-love-and-thunder,A.A. Dowd,True,"Jul 5, 2022",It’s the rare Marvel movie that barely holds together.
thor-love-and-thunder,Robert Kojder,False,"Jul 5, 2022","The final 45 minutes do plenty of heavy lifting and carry thunderous stakes and consequences, but it’s nowhere near enough to love this"

thor-love-and-thunder,Rosie Knight,False,"Jul 5, 2022","All in all... it’s another super fun superhero flick from Waititi, who cements himself as one of the MCU’s most exciting and original directors."
thor-love-and-thunder,Andrea Thompson,False,"Jul 5, 2022",Thank goodness for Disney wising up enough to bring back the comedic genius of Taika Waititi to leave Thor: Ragnarok in the dust for his most daring Marvel outing yet.
thor-love-and-thunder,Jordan Farley,False,"Jul 5, 2022","Unashamedly absurd, wildly entertaining and face-achingly funny, Love And Thunder makes Ragnarok look like Bresson. Another classic Thor adventure."
thor-love-and-thunder,Peter Howell,True,"Jul 5, 2022","[Waititi] ups the absurdity and the antics from his first go at the Norse myth narrative, with many recycled gags and diminishing returns."
thor-love-and-thunder,Hayden Mears,False,"Jul 5, 2022","Gone is the God of Smashing Coffee Mugs at Diners. Banished is the exhausting machismo of the self-proclaimed Strongest Avenger. Here, we see a God of Thunder who's lost, insecure, and vulnerable."
thor-love-and-thunder,Jeffrey Lyles,False,"Jul 5, 2022","Might not be in the upper echelon of MCU films, but Hemsworth has settled in so firmly to this role that even an inconsistent Thor adventure is worth the ride. Just don’t forget to muzzle those goats."
thor-love-and-thunder,Julian Roman,False,"Jul 5, 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder returns the Norse god to his bulging biceps in a hilarious sequel that borders on slapstick. The film questions the fundamental tenets of faith and religion. Not all of it works, but I chuckled consistently through a breezy runtime."
thor-love-and-thunder,Randy Meeks,False,"Jul 5, 2022",It's evident there's someone with a palpable personality behind the film actively rejecting to be like the rest of the MCU movies... [Waititi] doesn't hesitate to laugh at himself and show his most emotional side when necessary. [Full review in Spanish]
thor-love-and-thunder,Kirsten Acuna,False,"Jul 5, 2022","If you liked 2017's ""Thor: Ragnarok,"" you'll enjoy this, even if it does follow a few beats from the previous film a bit closely."
thor-love-and-thunder,David Fear,True,"Jul 5, 2022","A collision of competing tones, subplots, conceptual big swings and chaos masquerading as pathos, this new addition to the Asgardian-gods-and-monsters corner of Marvel Cinematic Universe is a holy mess."
thor-love-and-thunder,Janire Zurbano,False,"Jul 5, 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder is, at its core, a love letter to love. [Full review in Spanish]"
thor-love-and-thunder,Emma Stefansky,True,"Jul 5, 2022","Love and Thunder is badly paced, greenscreened into oblivion, and the constant dribble of jokes and jabs undercuts any attempt at plotting an emotional arc."
thor-love-and-thunder,Joshua Rivera,True,"Jul 5, 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder isn't just a misfire, it's a scam."
thor-love-and-thunder,Rodrigo Perez,False,"Jul 5, 2022","In our accelerated age of pop culture ADHD, it is remarkable how quickly something that feels fresh, can feel awfully familiar just one solo film later."
thor-love-and-thunder,Charles Koplinski,False,"Jul 5, 2022",One of the better entries in the Marvel Films universe.
thor-love-and-thunder,Kaila Hale-Stern,False,"Jul 5, 2022","We can rest assured that Thor: Love and Thunder, the singular product from all these moving parts, is deeply funny and lovely to look at."
thor-love-and-thunder,Sebastian Zavala Kahn,False,"Jul 5, 2022","The film is certainly fun, and it includes several original moments that could only have been conceived by Waititi, but at the same time, it never feels particularly epic or grand in scale. Full review in Spanish."
thor-love-and-thunder,Joshua Mackey,False,"Jul 5, 2022","While the film is a superhero film at its heart, it’s the comedic moments that give the film its soul. But this comedy is also delivered by really likable characters, which doesn’t hurt to get the job done."
thor-love-and-thunder,Ryan McQuade,False,"Jul 5, 2022","This is what Waititi is known for, finding the right balance of heart and hilarity in melding them together into something special."
thor-love-and-thunder,Matt Donato,False,"Jul 5, 2022",Thor: Love and Thunder is packed with love and unleashes its mighty thunder with all the colorful personality we've come to appreciate from Taika Waititi's films.
thor-love-and-thunder,Travis Hopson,False,"Jul 5, 2022",Thor: Love and Thunder is the weirdest rom-com you’re going to see this year.
thor-love-and-thunder,Allison Rose,True,"Jul 5, 2022",Phase four of the MCU has been disappointing for the most part and I’m sad to say Thor: Love and Thunder does nothing to dispel that label.
thor-love-and-thunder,Luke Y. Thompson,False,"Jul 5, 2022","For the most part, provided you already like these characters and their storylines, everything’s entertaining enough to cover the gaps in story logic."
thor-love-and-thunder,Fred Topel,True,"Jul 5, 2022","Saying this movie is better than the first two solo Thor movies is faint praise. While not Thorrible, Thor: Love and Thunder has few real triumphs, and its disappointments are glaring."
thor-love-and-thunder,Nate Adams,True,"Jul 5, 2022","Not even Russell Crowe’s campy version of Zeus raving about space orgies, a running gag involving screaming goats, and a pride-inclusive subplot can elevate a half-baked character piece where the sitcom style humor runs afoul quickly."
thor-love-and-thunder,Dominic Griffin,True,"Jul 5, 2022","An initially promising MCU outing that can't effectively synthesize either of its source material's themes into something coherent, but less affecting. A comedic Thor was necessary after The Dark World's failure, but its time for another change of pace."
thor-love-and-thunder,Stacey Yvonne,False,"Jul 5, 2022","Thor’s lack of true self awareness is what makes him endearing, it’s a much needed flaw in an otherwise appealing package."
thor-love-and-thunder,Leah Greenblatt,False,"Jul 5, 2022","More and more, this cinematic universe feels simultaneously too big to fail and too wide to support the weight of its own endless machinations. None of it necessarily makes any more sense in Waititi's hands, but at least somebody's having fun."
thor-love-and-thunder,Barry Hertz,True,"Jul 5, 2022","Ragnarok may have anointed Waititi as the MCU’s eccentric cinematic saviour, but the sequel only reveals the crushing reality of toiling in the superhero factory: bigger, bloat-ier, and bwah-wah-wah-wah-ier, in that Guns N’ Roses way."
thor-love-and-thunder,Julian Lytle,True,"Jul 5, 2022",Thor: Love and Thunder is a very uneven movie that never feels well thought out and doesn’t do well by its many characters besides Thor himself.
thor-love-and-thunder,Vicky Jessop,False,"Jul 5, 2022",Try not to compare Love and Thunder to Thor: Ragnarok. Judge it on its own terms and there’s a whole lot to love.
thor-love-and-thunder,Emmanuel Noisette,False,"Jul 5, 2022","Thor Love and Thunder is worth the watch in theaters. However, I would recommend going in with lower expectations to maximize your enjoyment of the film."
thor-love-and-thunder,Mike Massie,True,"Jul 5, 2022","Thor and Jane’s reunion is intended to be comically awkward, but their stunning absence of chemistry lends to genuinely cringe-worthy moments."
thor-love-and-thunder,Brian Orndorf,False,"Jul 5, 2022","The new, fun Thor probably drives comic book enthusiasts crazy, but he does marvelously on the big screen, with Waititi understanding the bigness of the character, the colorfulness of his world, and the universal feeling of his uncertainty."
thor-love-and-thunder,Eric Francisco,True,"Jul 5, 2022","But in a movie obsessed with Guns N Roses needle drops, Love and Thunder can’t find a singular, original rhythm of its own."
thor-love-and-thunder,Rachel Wagner,False,"Jul 5, 2022",Impressed with how it grapples with themes of faith and what do we do when we feel God isn’t listening or that He did listen and has seemingly abandoned us.
thor-love-and-thunder,Jeff Nelson,False,"Jul 5, 2022",Thor: Love and Thunder is a pop-rock visual extravaganza told through a series of legends that plays right off the Ragnarok chord.
thor-love-and-thunder,Clint Worthington,True,"Jul 5, 2022","A watered-down, kiddie-friendly remake of Ragnarok that brings little new to the table and stretches out its few decent jokes far past their breaking point."
thor-love-and-thunder,Nick Allen,False,"Jul 5, 2022","While it has too many familiar flourishes and jokes, this entertaining sequel is still a force for good, with enough visual ambition and heart in front of and behind the camera to stand on its own."
thor-love-and-thunder,Carla Hay,False,"Jul 5, 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder could also be called Thor: Grief and Comedy, because how of this superhero movie sequel balances these two themes with some results that are better than others. The movie goes big on showing bittersweet romance and true friendships."
thor-love-and-thunder,Jana Monji,False,"Jul 5, 2022","This is by far the best Thor film from the MCU yet, even without Loki. Waititi has blended screwball comedy with big action scenes and deftly balances the humor with the emotional content. Even Thor's weapons become characters in this film about love."
thor-love-and-thunder,Germain Lussier,False,"Jul 5, 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder is not nearly as cohesive or propulsive as Thor: Ragnarok, but it’s more ambitious and heartfelt...It can be a bumpy journey at times—but the destination is well worth the trip."
thor-love-and-thunder,Aaron Neuwirth,False,"Jul 5, 2022","The result is a film that’s perhaps not as well-rounded as it needs to be, but certainly lively, colorful, funny, and a proponent of the idea that love conquers all."
thor-love-and-thunder,John Campea,False,"Jul 5, 2022","It certainly leans more into the ""silly"" aspects of humor, but the end result is still solidly entertaining and funny. Lots of tears near the end of the film. Doesn't give much more direction to the MCU as a whole, but as a THOR movie it absolutely works."
thor-love-and-thunder,Dan Tabor,True,"Jul 5, 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder is okay at best, not really offering much by way of story or character development for Thor or the MCU. Hemsworth dials up the ham and dials down the drama for a film that once again makes Thor the least interesting avenger."
thor-love-and-thunder,Jeff York,True,"Jul 5, 2022",Thor's return this time though is seriously diminished by far too much shtick. There’s just too much corny humor and not enough thrilling heroics.
thor-love-and-thunder,Fico Cangiano,False,"Jul 5, 2022","Love and Thunder is pure rock'n roll adventure fun. Hilarious quite often, dark some instances and surprisingly emotional as well. That said, overall story and tone aren't as sharp as Ragnarok. [Full review in Spanish]"
thor-love-and-thunder,Larry Carroll,False,"Jul 5, 2022","While ""Love and Thunder"" isn't as good as 'Ragnarok,' it very much feels like a continuation."
thor-love-and-thunder,Alonso Duralde,True,"Jul 5, 2022","Attempts to balance the jokey tone of ""Ragnarok"" with themes and plot points that would feel more at home in an Ingmar Bergman film, and the results cancel each other out."
thor-love-and-thunder,Charles Pulliam-Moore,True,"Jul 5, 2022","While reframing Thor as the MCU’s himbo god of jocularity was a solid way of renewing interest in the character, an overabundance of jokes is one of the big reasons why Waititi’s Thor: Love and Thunder feels like an awkward step back."
thor-love-and-thunder,Rosalie Kicks,True,"Jul 5, 2022",Thor: Love and Thunder is trying hard to do a lot of things but in the end gets lost in itself.
thor-love-and-thunder,Tania Lamb,False,"Jul 5, 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder is good; it's not great. You'll get a bunch of laughs, but you also get a dose of cynicism that undercuts the spirit of love."
thor-love-and-thunder,Christian Toto,True,"Jul 5, 2022",Hemsworth and Portman can't be blamed for Taika Waititi's tonal misfire.
thor-love-and-thunder,Laura Clifford,False,"Jul 5, 2022","while there are several high points in this follow-up, most notably Russell Crowe’s take on Zeus, a lot of this film’s jokes, like Jane’s quest for a catchphrase, fall flat."
thor-love-and-thunder,Rohan Patel,False,"Jul 5, 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder is Marvel Studios’ most heartful and emotionally satisfying film to date, with an absolutely rockstar performance from leading man Chris Hemsworth!"
thor-love-and-thunder,Donald Clarke,False,"Jul 5, 2022",The computer-generated imagery refashions the cosmos into a candy-coloured amalgam of My Little Pony and an explosion in a lipstick factory.
thor-love-and-thunder,Casey Chong,False,"Jul 5, 2022","Overall, the mixed result of [Taika] Waititi's brand of zany action-comedy is a step down from Thor: Ragnarok [but] it does retain a few worthwhile fun and dramatic moments throughout its nearly two-hour length."
thor-love-and-thunder,Britany Murphy,True,"Jul 5, 2022","Ultimately, Thor: Love and Thunder is at its best when it wholly leans into the emotionally compelling parts of its story and stops trying to be Thor: Ragnarok 2.0."
thor-love-and-thunder,Danielle Solzman,False,"Jul 5, 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder might have some absurd things going on with everything happening but of all Marvel films, this one has earned it."
thor-love-and-thunder,Kate Sánchez,False,"Jul 5, 2022","A visual smorgasbord of film, Thor: Love and Thunder is joy and feelings with screaming goats, rainbow bridges, and a cast that knocks everything out of the park - even with third act faults."
thor-love-and-thunder,KiMi Robinson,False,"Jul 5, 2022","“Love and Thunder” doesn’t take itself seriously, employing soap opera-like acting and gags throughout. The more dramatic scenes are set apart in their tone and coloring, which has striking results."
thor-love-and-thunder,Sheraz Farooqi,True,"Jul 5, 2022","Despite some strong performances and few heartfelt moments, Thor: Love and Thunder ultimately buckles under a slew of tiresome humor and paper-thin character arcs. A sizable dip from the balance achieved in Thor: Ragnarok."
thor-love-and-thunder,Grant Watson,True,"Jul 5, 2022","The dramatic and comedic elements simply do not mix well; none of the more serious elements feel earned, and none of the humorous bits can be taken seriously. The film curdles."
thor-love-and-thunder,Matthew Turner,False,"Jul 5, 2022","It delivers the expected combination of action, emotion and humour, but there are signs that the Marvel formula is finally starting to wear thin."
thor-love-and-thunder,Perri Nemiroff,False,"Jul 5, 2022",A high-energy romp that highlights Taika Waititi's exceptional handle on blending humor and heart.
thor-love-and-thunder,Jenna Anderson,False,"Jul 5, 2022","The film's heartfelt and reverential core feels perfect for its crop of characters and for the current cultural moment, but that perfection is hindered by bizarre structural choices and inconsistent CGI."
thor-love-and-thunder,Scott Mendelson,True,"Jul 5, 2022","Bale and Thompson are great, but everyone else (including the director) looks and feels like they're just going through the motions out of commercial obligation."
thor-love-and-thunder,Mike Ryan,False,"Jul 5, 2022",Taika Waititi has certainly cracked the code on how to make a good Thor movie.
thor-love-and-thunder,Sean Keane,True,"Jul 5, 2022",The Marvel Cinematic Universe blockbuster fails to give Natalie Portman or Christian Bale enough time to shine as it tries to stuff in too much.
thor-love-and-thunder,Doug Jamieson,False,"Jul 5, 2022",Taika Waititi again mixes irreverent comedy with bombastic action to create a film that's far from groundbreaking but still good solid fun.
thor-love-and-thunder,Ed Potton,False,"Jul 5, 2022","This could have been a difficult second album for Taika Waititi, who made his Marvel debut in considerable style with Thor: Ragnarok in 2017. Fat chance."
thor-love-and-thunder,Paul McGuire Grimes,False,"Jul 5, 2022",It’s quite clear Chris Hemsworth is stilling having a blast playing Thor and has allowed the character to really evolve over the course of 11 years since his Marvel debut.
thor-love-and-thunder,Brian Lowry,True,"Jul 5, 2022","The impressive mix of tones and styles that director Taika Waititi pulled off in Thor: Ragnarok largely fizzles in Thor: Love and Thunder, which isn't as funny as it wants to be, as stirring as it needs to be or romantic as it ought to be."
thor-love-and-thunder,Matt Lynch,True,"Jul 5, 2022","The hints of [an] ... “auteurist” perspective on the material ... are fun enough to spot and inject a bit of personality, but nothing ever congeals; every scene just feels like a placeholder until we get to the end and set up the next thing."
thor-love-and-thunder,Stephanie Zacharek,True,"Jul 5, 2022","[It advertises] itself so loudly as “Fun!” that it ceases to actually be fun. This is the way with Waititi, a gifted director who, now that he’s no longer required to wield a light touch, seems to have forgotten how to do so."
thor-love-and-thunder,Tessa Smith,False,"Jul 5, 2022","Hilarious and emotional, but also goes to a very dark place. The must see, epic space adventure, romantic comedy of the summer."
thor-love-and-thunder,Caitlin Chappell,False,"Jul 5, 2022",Thor: Love and Thunder lives up to its name and sets the stage for an exciting future for this corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
thor-love-and-thunder,M.N. Miller,False,"Jul 5, 2022","Thankfully, Taika Waititi brings a serious amount of fun and a wonderful depth to Thor: Love and Thunder’s final scenes. It is the pure big studio comic book summer escapism we have been waiting for."
thor-love-and-thunder,Jim Schembri,False,"Jul 5, 2022",It certainly is good for a laugh even though it sometimes veers too close to becoming a joke...Once Russell Crowe enters the fray as Zeus it feels as though Thor: Love and Thunder has stepped through the looking glass and turned into a Mel Brooks film.
thor-love-and-thunder,Ben Travis,False,"Jul 5, 2022","Weirder than Ragnarok, but incredibly sincere in its outlook, Taika’s Thor-quel is a big, beautiful blast. You’ll love it, and probably thunder it too. What a classic Thor adventure!"
thor-love-and-thunder,Ann Hornaday,False,"Jul 5, 2022","“Thor: Love and Thunder” may not define a high point in the MCU’s ongoing mission of world domination, but it’s not a low point either."
thor-love-and-thunder,Linda Marric,False,"Jul 5, 2022","While there is very little doubt that this second instalment will go on to make just as much at the box office as its predecessor, if not more, it does however feel as though the franchise as whole has once and for all lost its shine and originality."
thor-love-and-thunder,Mark Kennedy,False,"Jul 5, 2022","The whipsaw from death and suffering to idiocy is staggering, with Jennifer Kaytin Robinson credited alongside Waititi for a script that seems like it was pasted together after gerbils ripped up a bag of words."
thor-love-and-thunder,Scott Greenstone,True,"Jul 5, 2022","“Thor 4” is the worst Marvel movie, because it’s not a movie — it’s content."
thor-love-and-thunder,Don Shanahan,True,"Jul 5, 2022","Since more and more of this character and his journey have become a dunderheaded joke, any substantial peril has reached a point where it feels merely temporary or, worse, flaky and flimsy."
thor-love-and-thunder,Clarisse Loughrey,False,"Jul 5, 2022",I can’t remember the last time the A-list stars of a Marvel film have all seemed genuinely happy to be there.
thor-love-and-thunder,Adam Graham,True,"Jul 5, 2022","It's more ""Use Your Illusion"" than it is ""Appetite for Destruction"": it works in parts but it's bloated, overblown, and in need of a trim, and all that's left now is the reunion tour."
thor-love-and-thunder,Justin Chang,True,"Jul 5, 2022","To the 60-plus-hours of theatrical content that have so far rolled off the Disney/Marvel assembly line, this fourth Thor-centric caper adds a mostly painless if largely pointless 120 minutes."
thor-love-and-thunder,Evan Dossey,True,"Jul 5, 2022",A hodgepodge of cool concepts without a good story to bind them.
thor-love-and-thunder,Brian Truitt,False,"Jul 5, 2022","“Thor: Love and Thunder” is a superhero romantic comedy with plenty of rippling biceps, an unshakable love for 1980s action movies and heavy metal, and most importantly, a big goofy heart."
thor-love-and-thunder,Caryn James,False,"Jul 5, 2022","It's hard to create tension when the stakes are so low. But the film's breezy tone and ultimately strong emotional depths make up for that flaw. This big-hearted Thor, thundering and sensitive, may be just the diverting hero we need right now."
thor-love-and-thunder,Jake Kring-Schreifels,True,"Jul 5, 2022","Much as Waititi has injected his own quirky brand of color and style into the MCU, here his levity often grows stale and overbearing."
thor-love-and-thunder,Josh Spiegel,True,"Jul 5, 2022",A superhero film with tonal whiplash.
thor-love-and-thunder,Glen Weldon,False,"Jul 5, 2022","The jokes land — but, particularly in the early going, they do so in a way that feels effortful, sweaty. But ... so what? ""This movie is too much like that other movie I liked!"" is not an oft-heard complaint among filmgoers, after all."
thor-love-and-thunder,Austin Burke,False,"Jul 5, 2022",Love and Thunder finds its footing in the second act. Taika brings us a colorful superhero movie with some incredible action scenes.
thor-love-and-thunder,Grace Randolph,False,"Jul 5, 2022","Like Doctor Strange 2, it seems there's a lot missing, and the two famous Thor comic book stories - Gorr & Jane as Thor - aren't done justice.  But Hemsworth & Bale are SO GOOD, and Waititi so funny & at times moving, it's still fun. Plus what an ending!"
thor-love-and-thunder,Kyle Pinion,True,"Jul 5, 2022","Oh well, we’ll always have Ragnarok."
thor-love-and-thunder,Alan Cerny,False,"Jul 5, 2022","Natalie Portman never treats this character (of Jane Foster) as silly or weightless, and while people may come to see Chris Hemsworth have fun as Thor, it’s Portman’s performance that I am most impressed with."
thor-love-and-thunder,Peter Bradshaw,False,"Jul 5, 2022","This is becoming a bit of a cul de sac – but that isn’t to say it isn’t still funny, and Thor still delivers a mighty hammer-blow, or rather axe-blow, of fun."
thor-love-and-thunder,Peter Gray,False,"Jul 5, 2022","Once Taika Waititi reinvented the Marvel wheel with 2017’s wild Thor: Ragnarok, it made sense that the studio big-wigs would bestow further free licensing in the character’s shift towards a more humorous mentality."
thor-love-and-thunder,Robbie Collin,False,"Jul 5, 2022","Bale gives the series its best villain in years. He and Hemsworth make surprisingly natural screen partners, while Portman embraces the soap-operatics of her role..."

thor-love-and-thunder,Mel Valentin,False,"Jul 5, 2022","It goes exactly as you’d expect in a superhero film co-written and directed by Taika Waititi (Jojo Rabbit, Hunt for the Wilderpeople, What We Do in the Shadows), i.e., not particularly well."
thor-love-and-thunder,Sean P. Means,False,"Jul 5, 2022",Taika Waititi has found the genre most appropriate for our muscular hammer-thrower: A sitcom.
thor-love-and-thunder,David Ehrlich,False,"Jul 5, 2022","If “Love and Thunder” is more of the same, it’s also never less than that. The MCU may still be looking for new purpose by the time this movie ends, but the mega-franchise can take solace in the sense that Thor has found some for himself."
thor-love-and-thunder,Ben Kendrick,False,"Jul 5, 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder is a return to form for the MCU: delivering a great solo story that is emotional, exciting, and downright funny as hell."
thor-love-and-thunder,Johnny Oleksinski,False,"Jul 5, 2022",The Marvel Cinematic Universe’s best shot at Oscar glory has arrived in the form of Christian Bale’s ferocious Gorr the God Butcher in “Thor: Love and Thunder.”
thor-love-and-thunder,Douglas Davidson,False,"Jul 5, 2022","... ""Love and Thunder"" is a heck of a rock show to go out on as friends old and new get their time to shine against a complex enemy who, merely by being introduced, creates more opportunities for chaos throughout the MCU."
thor-love-and-thunder,Owen Gleiberman,False,"Jul 5, 2022",By the end I felt something unusual enough to feel at a Marvel movie that it seemed almost otherworldly: I was moved.
thor-love-and-thunder,Brian Lloyd,False,"Jul 5, 2022","It might not be quite as sharp as 'Thor: Ragnarok', but the addition of Natalie Portman's gun show, the flying goats (it'll make sense when you see it), and the hard rock soundtrack gives it enough of an edge to make it enjoyable."
thor-love-and-thunder,Therese Lacson,False,"Jul 5, 2022","In Love and Thunder, Waititi honors not only what he created in Thor: Ragnarok, with its raucous humor and colorful aesthetic, but also what came before, offering a complex look at the God of Thunder."
thor-love-and-thunder,David Rooney,True,"Jul 5, 2022","The movie feels weightless, flippant, instantly forgettable, sparking neither love nor thunder."
thor-love-and-thunder,Kaitlyn Booth,False,"Jul 5, 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder tries to make the Ragnarok lightning strike twice, but the movie ends up feeling restrained due to the lack of genuinely emotional moments and some baffling creative decisions."
thor-love-and-thunder,Tom Jorgensen,False,"Jul 5, 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder is held back by a cookie-cutter plot and a mishandling of supporting characters, but succeeds as the MCU's first romantic comedy thanks to Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman's chemistry."
thor-love-and-thunder,Joey Magidson,False,"Jul 5, 2022",Thor: Love and Thunder continues to show how Taika Waititi's interpretation of the character makes all of the difference in the (Marvel) world.
thor-love-and-thunder,Christie Cronan,False,"Jul 5, 2022","Solid but not totally sold, Thor: Ragnarok still stands as the best Thor movie in the MCU."
thor-love-and-thunder,Ian Sandwell,False,"Jul 5, 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder is the most entertaining Phase 4 movie to date, but its irreverent touch means that when it aims for the heart, it never quite hits a bullseye."
thor-love-and-thunder,Lauren LaMagna,False,"Jul 5, 2022","""Thor: Love and Thunder"" is a step-up from ""Thor: Ragnarok"" in terms of exhibition, wit, emotion, and maturity."
thor-love-and-thunder,Jake Cole,True,"Jul 5, 2022","Across Taika Waititi’s film, a war against the gods feels like an afterthought to a bad rom-com."
thor-love-and-thunder,Roger Moore,False,"Jul 5, 2022","It’s the jokes that make it, with the self-mocking man-mountain Chris Hemsworth setting the tone and making it fun, and Natalie Portman, Tessa Thompson and the rest taking their cue from him."
thor-ragnarok,Joseph Garcia,False,"Mar 1, 2023",The movie single-handedly changed the status quo of a character more than any other Marvel movie. ... It should be commended for taking risks where other superhero films haven't.

thor-ragnarok,Michael J. Casey,False,"Apr 20, 2021",It certainly has a vibrant taste; too bad it dissipates quickly.

thor-ragnarok,Brandon Avery,False,"Sep 23, 2020",Finally a live adaptation of Thor that's actually worth your time!
thor-ragnarok,Stephen A. Russell,False,"Aug 19, 2020","irected by New Zealand's Taika Waititi, it's the daftest movie from the comic book studio to date, shot through with the anarchically quirky humour in Waititi's films like What We Do in the Shadows, Hunt for the Wilderpeople and Boy."
thor-ragnarok,Matt Cipolla,True,"Jul 23, 2020",It's when the second half of Ragnarok falls into the motions that it begins to lose its shine.
thor-ragnarok,Allen Almachar,False,"Jul 18, 2020","Instead of playing Thor as a Shakespearean persona, Waititi allows Hemsworth to use his natural wit and comedic timing to really bring the character to life."
thor-ragnarok,Damond Fudge,False,"Jul 18, 2020",Thor: Ragnarok is a prime example of how a complete tonal shift can rejuvenate a film series.

thor-ragnarok,Tim Brennan,False,"Feb 20, 2020","Ultimately, I feel confident in saying that you'll thoroughly enjoy Thor: Ragnarok. This is precision-engineered entertainment that wants you to have fun..."
thor-ragnarok,Jorge Ignacio Castillo,False,"Feb 5, 2020","Far and away the best movie about the God of Thunder and the funniest comedy of the year not involving Stalin, the third Thor movie benefits greatly from having Taika Waititi at the helm."

thor-ragnarok,Sarah Knight Adamson,False,"Jan 24, 2020","This isn't Deadpool, but close. It is the perfect popcorn movie that's full of entertainment and great special effects..."
thor-ragnarok,Chris McCoy,False,"Jan 16, 2020","As usual for these $100-million Marvel monstrosities, Thor: Ragnarok is busy and overstuffed, both visually and with characters. But it's at its best when it's being irreverent and meta -- Waititi's speciality."
thor-ragnarok,Siddhant Adlakha,False,"Dec 15, 2019","Thor changing his entire outlook on his kingdom isn't nearly as dramatically challenging as it ought to be. However, the film manages to stay afloat throughout, owing to a wildly refreshing comedic sensibility."

thor-ragnarok,Rhys Tarling,False,"Sep 30, 2019","Ragnarok finds new avenues for Thor where it can... And his new funky, jock-y 'tude, in lieu of his usual pompous dignity, is appropriate for a thunder god adventurer who traverses the galaxy in search of epic quests."

thor-ragnarok,Chris Sawin,False,"Sep 2, 2019","Thor: Ragnarok prides itself in being outrageously silly resulting in a different kind of superhero film that alters the landscape and has a lot of fun in doing so. It is a spontaneity driven juggernaut that puts the ""comic"" back in ""comical."""

thor-ragnarok,Ryan Syrek,False,"Jun 25, 2019","Director Taika Waititi has brought to life a sword-n'-sorcery scene airbrushed on the side of a creeper's van and infused it with rich characters, copious laughter and Cate Blanchett assuming her expected final form as Queen God of the Universe."

thor-ragnarok,Cameron Frew,False,"Oct 31, 2018","A colourful, delightfully raucous cacophony of riotous belly laughs and epic set-pieces, cementing itself as one of most outrageous entries in the series so far."
thor-ragnarok,Jennifer Heaton,False,"Oct 31, 2018","It works as a great culmination of the character's story over his five appearances, but functions well enough as a standalone action sci-fi comedy in its own right."

thor-ragnarok,Sean Mulvihill,False,"Oct 30, 2018","My only hope is that Thor: Ragnarok isn't Taika Waititi's only turn in the MCU; but if it is, he's made one of the most wildly entertaining installments in the sprawling franchise of superheroics."

thor-ragnarok,Leona Laurie,False,"Sep 10, 2018","Taika Waititi is rad, and this completely fun movie is evidence of that. The Hela stuff could be better, but Sakar is on-point & Jeff Goldblum is the Jeff Goldblummiest."

thor-ragnarok,Stephen Rebello,False,"Nov 2, 2017","Thor: Ragnarok might rub some humorless Marvel purists the wrong way, but for the less obsessive among us, it's every bit as silly and mocking as it ought to be."
thor-ragnarok,Chris Klimek,False,"Nov 2, 2017","What it lacks in urgency - which is a lot, given that the story involves an extinction-level threat to Asgard and All Who Therein Dwell - it makes up for in alacrity."
thor-ragnarok,Richard Roeper,False,"Nov 2, 2017","The only thing I enjoyed more than the comedy in Thor: Ragnarok was a climactic battle sequence synced perfectly to Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song."""

thor-ragnarok,Matthew Lickona,True,"Nov 2, 2017","Director Taika Waititi's take on the God of Thunder plays a bit like the rock mockumentary This is Spinal Tap: it's front-loaded with jokes, built around a severe humbling, and full of silly bombast."
thor-ragnarok,Clint O'Connor,False,"Nov 2, 2017","Fortunately, the charismatic Hemsworth is such good company, you're willing to play along and cruise past the roadblocks."
thor-ragnarok,Richard von Busack,False,"Nov 2, 2017","A comedy of outsized figures bashing at one another, punching their frenemies into the next county."

thor-ragnarok,Bennett Campbell Ferguson,True,"Nov 2, 2017",Ragnarok is a glorified commercial for next year's Avengers: Infinity War.
thor-ragnarok,Jesse Hassenger,False,"Nov 2, 2017","Thor: Ragnarok feels like a Taika Waititi movie, and a very good one - in part because however briefly, it takes the god of thunder off the perpetual-motion machine of success."
thor-ragnarok,Walter Chaw,False,"Nov 2, 2017",... funnier than the usual Marvel product because it's directed by Taika Waititi (What We Do in the Shadows)...
thor-ragnarok,Andrea Gronvall,False,"Nov 2, 2017","This is a colorful mashup of Scandinavian myth, interplanetary sci-fi, Old Testament references, and crossover comic book characters."
thor-ragnarok,Anthony Morris,False,"Nov 2, 2017","Increasingly, it's obvious that much of the Marvel universe works best when it goes big and silly: Thor: Ragnarok is about as big and silly as a Marvel movie is ever going to get."

thor-ragnarok,Kristian M. Lin,False,"Nov 2, 2017","It was only two years ago in Avengers: Age of Ultron that we started to see what a gifted comic actor Hemsworth is, so it makes eminently good sense for this entire movie to be played as a comedy."

thor-ragnarok,Max Weiss,False,"Nov 2, 2017","The whole cast is great. When you have Idris Elba in a relatively minor role of the all-seeing protector Heimdall, you know your ensemble is stacked."
thor-ragnarok,Sean P. Means,False,"Nov 2, 2017","By making Thor: Ragnarok as much a comedy as an action movie, Waititi brings some needed lightness to Marvel's storyline."
thor-ragnarok,Anna Leszkiewicz,False,"Nov 2, 2017",The plot is chaotic and the pacing is bizarre (scenes are unusually short and fast). But it's undeniably a riot.
thor-ragnarok,Frank Swietek,False,"Nov 2, 2017","[Has] a comic spin even in the action scenes... in a genre that often seems more intent on pummeling you into submission than giving you a good time, its light, breezy approach is a breath of fresh air."

thor-ragnarok,Brad Keefe,False,"Nov 2, 2017","While Marvel movies have explored some heavier emotion, Ragnarok is the kind of roller-coaster ride I can get behind. Its exposition isn't too heavy, and it rarely goes more than a few minutes without delivering a thrill, a laugh or both."

thor-ragnarok,Jim Slotek,False,"Nov 2, 2017","As if trying to out-do Guardians of The Galaxy for wisecracks-per-minute, Thor: Ragnarok oxymoronically takes one of the most dire Norse concepts and turns it into a romp with a barrage of broad jokes and slapstick."
thor-ragnarok,Clayton Davis,False,"Nov 2, 2017","Tessa Thompson's badassery has jumped to new heights as her Valkyrie seems to be Marvel's answer to DC's ""Wonder Woman,"" showing (ONCE AGAIN) that women should be given their own vehicle in the MCU."

thor-ragnarok,Tom Russo,False,"Nov 2, 2017","As a steady stream of random wit and bawdiness, it's a good time. But as a story ostensibly escalating toward the titular cataclysm - Norse mythology's take on doomsday - ""Ragnarok"" feels too episodic, a scattered trifle passed off as epic."

thor-ragnarok,Rohan Naahar,False,"Nov 2, 2017","Everything from the font used in the titles, to the synth-infused rock opera score by Mark Mothersbaugh, to the gloriously retro set design and visuals clearly inspired by the art of Jack Kirby, there is no Marvel movie quite like it."
thor-ragnarok,James Berardinelli,True,"Nov 1, 2017","Superhero fans deserve better than this. Battles should have heart, danger, and consequences. The conflicts in Thor: Ragnarok are lacking in all three."
thor-ragnarok,Manohla Dargis,False,"Nov 1, 2017","Mr. Hemsworth looks happier and far more relaxed in ""Ragnarok"" than he did in the previous Thor vehicles, which is perhaps Mr. Waititi's truest achievement here."
thor-ragnarok,Erik Henriksen,False,"Nov 1, 2017","I guess it's technically possible you'll see another movie this year that'll be this much fun, but I doubt it. And even if you do, it won't have Space Goldblum."

thor-ragnarok,Laura Clifford,False,"Nov 1, 2017","The choice of New Zealand director Taika Waititi has created a lot of excitement for the latest installment, and while it is fun, one cannot help but feel that Marvel television writers..don't bring enough wit to the proceedings."

thor-ragnarok,Bilge Ebiri,False,"Oct 27, 2017","In its own weird little way, Thor: Ragnarok manages to poke fun at the constant churn of myth and entertainment of which the movie itself is a part. It's a candy-colored cage of delights, but it is a cage nevertheless - and it doesn't hide that fact."

thor-ragnarok,Stephanie Zacharek,True,"Oct 26, 2017","Thor: Ragnarok is packed tight with zooming space vehicles and noisy thunder battles, but the movie's extravagant excess is more narcotizing than energizing. Even poor Thor seems lost in all of it, and he's supposed to be its star."
thor-ragnarok,Peter Travers,False,"Oct 26, 2017","Granted, there are probably more monsters and CGI battles and explosions than the movie needs. But director Waititi and star Hemsworth keep this Thor party hopping like it's 1999 and Ragnarok will never come. Good times."

thor-ragnarok,Paul Whitington,False,"Oct 20, 2017","I'm normally the first to moan about the awful ubiquity of the superhero genre, but when they get these things right, one has to admit they can be fun."
thor-ragnarok,Simon Gallagher,False,"Oct 20, 2017","If you're already a fan of Waititi, Ragnarok will be like a warm bath of his particular brand of humour, but if - for some reason - you like your comic book movie homogenous, it might not be for you. But maybe try broadening your horizons, yeah?"
thor-ragnarok,Michael Ordoña,False,"Oct 20, 2017","Funniest Thor movie has tons of style, plenty of violence."
thor-ragnarok,Emma Simmonds,False,"Oct 20, 2017","If the Thor films have been a bit 'meh' thus far, by allowing Waititi room to do his genuinely eccentric thing, the 17th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe might just be its best."

thor-ragnarok,Michael Coldwell,False,"Oct 19, 2017","Thor: Ragnarok is an awesomely entertaining premier league win for Thor that fizzes with inventive energy. Nine years and 17 movies into the MCU, that's got to be worth some serious flagons of ale."

thor-ragnarok,William Bibbiani,False,"Oct 19, 2017","A whimsical distraction of a movie, and it's worth recommending on that level, but it clearly had the potential to be so much more."
thor-ragnarok,Kelli Weston,False,"Oct 19, 2017","Thor: Ragnarok plunges headfirst into unbridled comedy and Waititi gives his actors ample room to showcase their natural comedic talents, especially Hemsworth and Blanchett."

thor-ragnarok,Alonso Duralde,False,"Oct 19, 2017","Both the banter and the fighting, it should be noted, are excellent, so whether you go to superhero movies for the glossy escapism or the pulse-pounding action, you'll get your large soda's worth."

thor-ragnarok,Kyle Anderson,False,"Oct 19, 2017","This is top to bottom Hemsworth's movie, and in his fifth time playing Thor, is at his very peak, and that's quite the heroic feat."
thor-ragnarok,Brock Wilbur,False,"Oct 19, 2017","It deviates from everything it's structured the franchise to be, but it's also a perfect example of taking big risks for even bigger wins."

thor-ragnarok,Kevin Harley,False,"Oct 19, 2017","You never have to wait more than five minutes for a joke or well-placed wisecrack. Anytime there's a danger of someone giving a cliched, worthy speech about power and responsibility there's a one liner delivered like a slap to the back of the head."

thor-ragnarok,Peter Debruge,True,"Oct 19, 2017","While it's not saying much, ""Thor: Ragnarok"" is easily the best of the three Thor movies - or maybe I just think so because its screenwriters and I finally seem to agree on one thing: The Thor movies are preposterous."

thor-ragnarok,Scott Mendelson,False,"Oct 19, 2017","Strong visuals, gonzo action and a high comedy compensate for generic plotting, a padded midsection and a lack of drama."

thor-the-dark-world,David Hogan,False,"Apr 14, 2021","Thor: The Dark World isn't a bad film, but it's decidedly average, which in a ""cinematic universe"" full of really enjoyable films makes it stand out as bad..."
thor-the-dark-world,Richard Crouse,False,"Feb 1, 2021",Once the movie gets the exposition out of the way and gets into the gags and the action it hammers home the good stuff.
thor-the-dark-world,Mike Massie,False,"Dec 4, 2020",The effects-laden imagery provides genuine awe as the filmmakers parade an impressive variety of otherworldly sights through action sequences with thundering fervor.

thor-the-dark-world,Allen Almachar,True,"Jul 23, 2020","A goofy, clunky film more interested in fitting with the rest of the Marvel Universe than in telling its own fully developed story."

thor-the-dark-world,Fiona Underhill,False,"Jul 12, 2020","A far more entertaining and superior film to the first Thor. It keeps my interest throughout, has great humour, great characters, great set-pieces, some stunning visuals - what more could you ask for?"

thor-the-dark-world,Siddhant Adlakha,True,"Dec 15, 2019","Its various subplots are connected not by theme or by character, but by coincidence. It has the appearance of well-structured drama, but it leaves too many elements hanging in mid-air to form a coherent whole."
thor-the-dark-world,Katie Smith-Wong,False,"Nov 21, 2019","Regardless of the numerous plot twists, there are brilliant jokes and great fights, Thor: The Dark World is a fitting sequel for post-Avengers action."
thor-the-dark-world,Ryan Syrek,False,"Aug 27, 2019","Overall, the script may be sloppy and the tone may fluctuate but darn if Thor: The Dark World ain't the fantasy/sci-fi, slapstick, action-packed, bizarre romp you never knew you kinda wanted."

thor-the-dark-world,David Brake,False,"Jun 7, 2019","There's a real absence of mystique and depth as hit-and-miss jokes/sidekicks dominate, leaving the viewer pining for the subtler notes from its predecessor - or even from Iron Man 3."

thor-the-dark-world,Shubhra Gupta,True,"Mar 18, 2019","Loki is the only character who makes himself new and interesting. When he is around, Thor: The Dark World becomes a different film altogether. You wish there was more of him. The rest of it is metal clanking."
thor-the-dark-world,Lee Cassanell,False,"Mar 6, 2019","It's only when the scenery-chewing Loki enters the fray that this sequel really comes alive, with Hiddleston effortlessly swinging from comedy to villainy and back again."
thor-the-dark-world,Nathalia Aryani,False,"Jan 22, 2019","Thor: The Dark World may not necessarily merit a thunderous applause, but it's an entertaining, otherworldly escape."
thor-the-dark-world,Abbie Bernstein,False,"Jan 19, 2019","Thor: The Dark World looks great and is moderately good fun, but it lacks the verbal snap and visceral charge of some of its Marvel relatives."
thor-the-dark-world,Emmet Asher-Perrin,False,"Jan 14, 2019","It is truly enjoyable to cut between the grandeur of Asgard and the mundanity of our own planet, seeing Jane try to date, watching Darcy continually butt in on her life."

thor-the-dark-world,Frank Ochieng,True,"Nov 12, 2018",..waxes its big-budgeted whimsy but leaves out the core element of simply tooting its humble horn as a compelling down-to-earth Marvel Comics sideshow. Thor's fellow heroic handlers are not losing any sleep to the strained adventures that exist
thor-the-dark-world,Zaki Hasan,False,"Nov 2, 2018","Thor: The Dark World falls somewhere in the middle of the pack, neither raising the bar nor lowering it. And really, this isn't a bad pack to be in the middle of."
thor-the-dark-world,Jennifer Heaton,False,"Nov 1, 2018","It is certainly one of Marvel's weaker efforts, but considering they already gave us the masterpiece that is Iron Man 3 this year I can cut them some slack."

thor-the-dark-world,Dan Casey,False,"Jul 14, 2015","A massively enjoyable film that course-corrects the missteps of the original and delivers on big action, grittier subject matter, and a less pretentious take on the sometimes prohibitively dense Thor canon."
thor-the-dark-world,Kate Muir,True,"Jul 14, 2015","When Marvel brought in Alan Taylor, the director of Game of Thrones, to invigorate the Thor franchise, many hoped for a breast-bearing, dwarf-battling, blood-spurting melodrama -- with capes and hammers. Sadly, it was not to be."
thor-the-dark-world,Daniel Barnes,True,"Jul 14, 2015","The superhero gets a second solo album with Thor: The Dark World, which manages to outpace the first Thor in terms of atonality and gobbledygook."
thor-the-dark-world,Norman Wilner,False,"Jul 14, 2015","Don't worry about its grim title and galactic stakes. For all its self-seriousness, Thor: The Dark World is a very silly movie. And that's why it works."

thor-the-dark-world,Erin Free,False,"Jul 14, 2015","Thor: The Dark World is a wildly entertaining continuation of Marvel's dominance of the big budget action blockbuster genre, and a savvy revisit of its most difficult and ambitious piece of character mythology."
thor-the-dark-world,Alex Doenau,False,"Jul 14, 2015","This movie is marking time for bigger things, a constant fear in the lead-up to another Avengers outing, but it's fun and entertaining enough to justify the time spent watching it."
thor-the-dark-world,Randall King,False,"Jul 14, 2015","Sure, Hemsworth is physically impressive as Thor, but let's face it, the evil Loki got all the charm in that family. (Hiddleston is as reliable a scene-stealer here as he was in The Avengers.)"
thor-the-dark-world,Brad Keefe,True,"Jul 14, 2015","Pacing is a problem, as sequences setting up an intergalactic finale drag, particularly when the film spends far more time on Asgard, with almost none of the fish-out-of-water charm that made the first film work."

thor-the-dark-world,Rashid Irani,False,"Jul 14, 2015","The smash-happy action is complemented by wondrous visuals and techno-chic production values. The climactic London-set battle royale, with Thor's magic mallet ever primed for slinging, holds the viewer in a vice-like grip."
thor-the-dark-world,Christopher Lawrence,True,"Jul 14, 2015","With its dark elves, some kind of lava beast known as the Kurse, and too much time spent walking around in cloaks, the sequel too often feels like watered-down Tolkien."
thor-the-dark-world,Katherine Monk,False,"Jul 14, 2015","There's good reason to stay awake for this goofy, explosive and oddly warm-hearted yarn that knits a cold story of family dysfunction with matinee spectacle."

thor-the-dark-world,Geoffrey Macnab,False,"Feb 21, 2014","[Director Alan Taylor] is helped by Tom Hiddleston's sleekly malevolent performance as Thor's untrustworthy brother Loki, a more engaging and complex figure than Chris Hemsworth's monosyllabic Thor."

thor-the-dark-world,Corey Hall,False,"Nov 8, 2013","As stolidly drab as Thor can be, his trickster half-brother Loki is still a scream, and the picture perks up considerably when he's around, though how much more energy can be squeezed out of his antics is debatable."
thor-the-dark-world,Steve Biodrowski,True,"Nov 8, 2013",At least the Thor-Loki narrative thread is worth unwinding. Too bad it's twisted up with all the overblown blockbuster nonsense.
thor-the-dark-world,Jim Schembri,False,"Nov 8, 2013","Can you believe it's been several weeks since the last blockbuster comic book super-hero movie? How did we survive so long? Fortunately, Thor 2 has arrived to keep us from going into withdrawal."

thor-the-dark-world,Christopher Orr,False,"Nov 8, 2013","Though hardly a must-see, Thor: The Dark World is better than the original: a looser, loopier hybrid of science fiction and fantasy powered by a pair of magnetic performances and leavened with a number of truly witty moments."

thor-the-dark-world,Ethan Alter,False,"Nov 8, 2013","It's a good thing that Taylor and the cast have such a firm grasp on the mirco details, because on a macro-level, The Dark World just barely hangs together."

thor-the-dark-world,Kimberley Jones,False,"Nov 8, 2013","The limited ambition of The Dark World's climax is a relief. It scuttles all term paper aspirations and instead humbly lobs a thesis statement-slash-open invitation: Let's have some fun, shall we? And so we did."

thor-the-dark-world,Austin Kennedy,True,"Nov 8, 2013","Marvel has seemed to turn Thor into one giant joke. The plot is a mess, the effects look cheap, and Kat Dennings' annoying character practically dominates the movie. THOR: THE DARK WORLD is one major letdown!"

thor-the-dark-world,Rob Thomas,True,"Nov 8, 2013","There's much talk in ""The Dark World"" of the Nine Realms all coming into alignment for the first time in 5,000 years, but that's nothing - try and keep nine superhero franchises lined up."
thor-the-dark-world,Mathew DeKinder,False,"Nov 8, 2013",The plot ... really doesn't matter all that much. The fun in this movie comes from watching this fine cast give its all to a film that truthfully is beneath each and every one of them.

thor-the-dark-world,Rob Vaux,False,"Nov 8, 2013","Simple, blunt and very good at what it does; in that sense, it matches its amiable lunkhead of a hero."
thor-the-dark-world,Phil Villarreal,True,"Nov 8, 2013","This is a sequel that, compared to the original, is unequal, with pointless, dull CGI battles in Thor's pointless, dull outer realms."
thor-the-dark-world,John Hanlon,False,"Nov 8, 2013",The great interplay between the title character and his sarcastic brother Loki make this sequel worthwhile.
thor-the-dark-world,Jeffrey Lyles,False,"Nov 8, 2013",The most thoroughly fan pleasing comic book film since 'The Avengers.' I'm already pumped up for 'Thor 3.'

thor-the-dark-world,Eric Melin,False,"Nov 8, 2013","After a good 20 minutes of laborious setup, the film finally moves forward. When it does, it's the charisma of the actors (especially Tom Hiddleston) and the film's sense of humor that keep it afloat."
thor-the-dark-world,Mike Scott,True,"Nov 8, 2013","It's all built around so much clanging of swords and denting of armor, but lacking that spark of life that the Avengers family of films is built upon."

thor-the-dark-world,Nell Minow,False,"Nov 8, 2013",Hiddleston is clearly having a blast as a god who lives for chaos and he brings a jolt of pure devilish pleasure to every scene he is in.

thor-the-dark-world,Jonathan W. Hickman,False,"Nov 7, 2013",There's just a little in this movie for everyone. And such scattershot fun is more than enough to tide us over until Captain American returns next year.

thor-the-dark-world,Chris Knight,False,"Nov 7, 2013","There was a moment where I was certain Loki's treachery knew one bound, but he's the master of the quadruple-cross, and he loves it. Viewers can have a bit of fun as well, since Taylor keeps the scale of mayhem mostly manageable."
thor-the-dark-world,Michael O'Sullivan,True,"Nov 7, 2013","If I'm spending that much time studying Odin's grooming, there's something wrong with the story, which is kind of slow to get going and features too many undeveloped threads."
thor-the-dark-world,Joe Morgenstern,True,"Nov 7, 2013",This action-adventure sequel from Marvel soon turns so dumb and 3-D-murky that it hurts.
thor-the-dark-world,Jeannette Catsoulis,True,"Nov 7, 2013","Dancing above a leaden plot and lumpy dialogue, Mr. Hiddleston moves his fine-boned features and graceful body, as if what he were doing matters; he seems imported from a quite different movie."
thor-the-dark-world,Michael Burgin,False,"Nov 7, 2013","It's outlandish, occasionally silly and surprisingly fun."
thor-the-dark-world,Joshua Starnes,False,"Nov 7, 2013",Thor: The Dark World is a bombastic sequel which celebrates everything the first film did well while still not knowing what to do with its poor mortals.

thor-the-dark-world,Ian Buckwalter,False,"Nov 7, 2013","Dimensions collide, and Taylor allows the film to hurtle with the force of Thor's hammer into pure popcorn-spectacle territory."
thor-the-dark-world,Jeanne Kaplan,False,"Nov 7, 2013","The screenplay by Christopher Yost, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely is, mercifully, not too long, and infused with just enough humor to make it enjoyable."

thor-the-dark-world,Frank Swietek,True,"Nov 7, 2013","A brainless, chaotic piece of comic-book hokum so loud and action-packed that by the end you might feel you've been clobbered over the head by the hero's big old hammer."

thor-the-dark-world,Michael Sragow,False,"Nov 7, 2013","It's like a smorgasbord designed to give fans all they can eat -- or a roadside 24-hour buffet that clocks in, blessedly, at a mere two hours. Its welcoming air and variety can't fully disguise its lack of top-notch ingredients."
thor-the-dark-world,Rick Bentley,False,"Nov 7, 2013","With all the death and destruction going on, there's still time for the kind of light humor that has helped distinguish films based on Marvel Comics characters."

thor-the-dark-world,Jason Anderson,False,"Nov 7, 2013","Pleasingly old-school, Thor: The Dark World has a greater kinship with the science-fiction movies of the 1950s or even the first Star Wars cycle than the more earthbound adventures of Tony Stark and the rest of Thor's fellow Avengers."

thor-the-dark-world,David Frese,False,"Nov 7, 2013","Keeping a hammer-swinging god grounded in a world we can relate to isn't easy, but thanks to good performances, solid effects and great pacing, Taylor and his cast have nailed it."
thor-the-dark-world,Peter Travers,True,"Nov 7, 2013",Not enough Loki. Too many tacky 3D effects. And then there's the hard fact that everything old isn't necessarily new again just because the bottom line wishes it so.
thor-the-dark-world,Joe Williams,False,"Nov 7, 2013","""Thor: The Dark World"" spreads enough of the love to co-stars, set designers and special effects personnel to make us forget that the hero is just a glorified quarterback from somebody else's favorite team."
thor-the-dark-world,Richard Corliss,True,"Nov 7, 2013","The clutter makes your head feel like it's about to explode - and not in a good way, with wonders upon wonders. Instead it seems like arcana that might show up on the midterm final: the next Marvel movie."

thor-the-dark-world,Jeff Beck,False,"Nov 6, 2013","Most people know from experience that you're not going to get a comprehensible plot or characters that you end up feeling something for, but when it comes to good old fashion entertainment, this is usually just the kind of film that gets the job done."
thor-the-dark-world,Ty Burr,True,"Nov 6, 2013",How do you know that Thor: The Dark World is for the fan-boys and absolutely nobody else? The opening exposition is sub-Tolkien balderdash that merely has the power to put you to sleep in seconds.

thor-the-dark-world,Laura Clifford,True,"Nov 6, 2013","director Alan Taylor's (HBO's 'Game of Thrones') ploy is to revert to comedy whenever the plot stops making sense. Too often, we're treated to the sight of Stellan Skarsgrd (as scientist Erik Selvig) running around without his pants on."

thor-the-dark-world,Vincent Mancini,False,"Nov 6, 2013","Ridiculous movies are a lot like ""mean"" or offensive comedy. It works if the comedian knows he's being mean, or if the movie knows it's ridiculous. Thor: The Dark World knows it's ridiculous."

thor-the-dark-world,Cameron Williams,False,"Nov 3, 2013",Maintains a wonderful blend of fantasy and science fiction but it's an exhausting juggling act that grids Marvel's successful run on the big screen to a near halt

thor-the-dark-world,Devin Faraci,False,"Nov 2, 2013","Thor: The Dark World is a movie that understands why we like these characters, how they work and how to best bounce them off each other. I'll forgive the overclocked pacing because the movie swept me so perfectly into a big, weird world."
thor-the-dark-world,Tim Martain,False,"Nov 2, 2013","This sequel once again defies the odds, director Alan Taylor improving on the already solid foundation built by Branagh to deliver a movie that is as self-assured as it is fun."

thor-the-dark-world,Jason Best,False,"Nov 1, 2013","Taylor really pulls out all the stops for the film's climax, an epic dustup in which the antagonists whiz back and forth between different realms through wormholes in space... Fast moving, fun, and deftly edited, it ensures the movie goes out on a high."
thor-the-dark-world,Matthew Turner,False,"Oct 31, 2013","Delivers thrills, laughs and emotion in equal measure, thanks to a witty script, superb performances, thrilling action sequences and assured direction from Alan Taylor that gets the tone exactly right."
thor-the-dark-world,Lewis Bazley,False,"Oct 31, 2013","It hasn't got the story to quite match the spectacle, but it's another exciting and witty entry in the Marvel cinematic canon."

thor-the-dark-world,Tom Huddleston,False,"Oct 29, 2013","Most of what worked in 'Thor' works again: Hiddleston is campy and treacherous, Hemsworth is puppy-dog keen and there's a nice line in knowing jokery."

thor-the-dark-world,Simon Miraudo,False,"Oct 29, 2013","Thor: The Dark World strives for Star Wars with its dense world-building , but its goofy sense of humour (and overall frivolousness) makes it feel more like the first season of Buffy... This is a good kind of problem."
thor-the-dark-world,Siobhan Synnot,False,"Oct 28, 2013","These are the things I love in Thor films, and thank goodness they are all present in Thor: The Dark World. What is missing, unfortunately, is the original's sense of ebullient entertainment."

thor-the-dark-world,Andy Lea,True,"Oct 27, 2013","There's more than enough here for the comic book lot. But the rest of us have probably seen enough space portals, mid-air punch-ups and tepid love stories to last us an Asgardian lifetime."

thor-the-dark-world,William Bibbiani,False,"Oct 22, 2013",Even the unnecessarily complicated plot and the villain's overly simplified motivation can't keep Thor: The Dark World from at least being fun.
thor-the-dark-world,Mark Adams,False,"Oct 22, 2013",Of all of the Marvel franchises Thor always felt the most difficult to pull off (he is a virtually indestructible God after all) but here it all ties together rather well.

thor,Don Shanahan,False,"Sep 4, 2023","It's a grand, epic, and galaxy-bending display of gods among men.  Never before has a superhero movie been so, well, super in its scope and size, yet still leaving room for a little dose of humanity."

thor,Siddhant Adlakha,True,"Dec 15, 2019","Marvel's reluctance to entertain the notion of confronting military conquest works to its narrative detriment. The heroes aren't allowed to truly change, because they're never made to face the parts of themselves most connected to the world around them."

thor,Eileen Jones,True,"Nov 2, 2018","Thor's not entirely worthless, though. There are a few good things about it. For example, it's so loud that if you happen to be preoccupied by something bad in your life, you can't think about it while you're in the theater."
thor,Zaki Hasan,False,"Nov 2, 2018","If Thor isn't necessarily a home run, it's an extremely solid base hit, effectively extending the goal posts of what to expect in this universe without ever shattering our suspension of disbelief"

thor,Candice Frederick,False,"Sep 8, 2017","Witty, charming and very current, the big screen adaptation of Thor is sure to catapult its star Chris Hemsworth (whose wife, Elsa Pataky, ironically stars in Fast Five) to leading man status."

thor,Kristian M. Lin,False,"Jul 18, 2016","[The] result isn't as much fun as the Iron Man movies, but it's better than The Incredible Hulk and a worthy entry in the fast-growing Avengers series."

thor,Sean Burns,True,"May 3, 2015",The mildly amusing midsection plays like a Viking take on Crocodile Dundee.
thor,Jeffrey Lyles,False,"Nov 6, 2013",Strikes a mighty blow to the summer blockbuster season and will charge up audiences just like the first 'Iron Man.'
thor,Will Chadwick,False,"Apr 21, 2013",Thor is terrific fun! It's aware of its own silliness but made with complete integrity and heart. The film is also beautifully designed and very well performed. A great summer blockbuster!
thor,Alaina O'Connor,False,"Apr 12, 2013","Tempering its sweeping scope with wit, humor, and just a little dose of dramatics, Thor is a super-charged fantasy epic that can stand alone in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."

thor,Jeff Beck,False,"Sep 20, 2012","""Thor"" reminded me a lot of the ""Iron Man"" films. They are not particularly great, but they are highly entertaining with their explosive action sequences and fascinating characters."
thor,Stephen Rebello,False,"Feb 18, 2012","Adapted lovingly and good-naturedly from the comic, Thor gains some Shakespearean heft from its themes of sibling rivalry, epic emotions and touching Oedipal conflict."
thor,Laurence Boyce,False,"Dec 13, 2011","It does nothing to stand out from the other comic book adaptations of the past few years, but it's an adequate and enjoyable slice of hokum."

thor,Ed Whitfield,False,"Jun 28, 2011",It may not be strongest film to have made the transition from comic book to screen but it does whet the appetite for more from the hammer-wielding thoroughbred and his jealous sibling.
thor,Brandon Fibbs,False,"Jun 21, 2011","The problem with the current crop of superhero movies is that once you've exhausted the A-list, you begin reaching for the second string personalities who do not have the same sort of populist street cred."
thor,Jim Schembri,False,"Jun 16, 2011","Director Kenneth Branagh, for all the Shakespearean fruitiness he imbues into some of his A-list performers, never forgets that Thor is ultimately an FX-driven film designed to sell popcorn."

thor,Charles Koplinski,False,"Jun 8, 2011",Thor visually muddled but still worth seeing.
thor,David Poland,True,"Jun 7, 2011",This film was not painful to watch... but it was no pleasure.

thor,Roger Ebert,True,"May 12, 2011","The story might perhaps be adequate for an animated film for children, with Thor, Odin and the others played by piglets. In the arena of movies about comic book superheroes, it is a desolate vastation."

thor,Keith Cohen,False,"May 7, 2011","This movie has all the sci-fi fantasy, wonder and magic we have come to expect from Marvel. The 114-minute running time passes by swiftly and leaves you wanting more. The action scenes are well-staged and the computer graphics special effects are..."
thor,Andrea Chase,False,"May 6, 2011","a lesser entry in the super-hero to cinema game, but one that is splendidly diverting on its own limited terms and commendable for refraining from camp"
thor,Pablo Villaça,True,"May 6, 2011","Soa menos como um filme e mais como um ""previously on The Avengers"", já que se preocupa tanto em preparar o terreno para o grande projeto da Marvel que se esquece de ter personalidade própria."

thor,Christopher Lloyd,False,"May 6, 2011","Like Thor himself, the movie is overly puffed up and self-serious. But the character experiences a satisfying arc of change, turning into a genuinely heroic figure whose magic hammer does some serious smiting."
thor,Jeff Meyers,False,"May 6, 2011","...Branagh and his winning cast keep things likably accessible and fantastically opulent, delivering an adventure with genuine humor, spectacle and gravitas. Fanboys will lap it up like mother's milk."

thor,Ian Buckwalter,False,"May 6, 2011",Kenneth Branagh and the team of writers who have brought the super-hero spin on the Norse god of thunder to the big screen decide to largely ditch the usual hero alter-ego bit. In its place is a movie with a split personality of its own.

thor,Chris Vognar,False,"May 6, 2011","Nothing against the buff, blond God of Thunder, but Thor just doesn't have a built-in wow factor among the nongeek brigade."

thor,Jim Lane,False,"May 6, 2011",... a two-hour preview trailer for The Avengers ...
thor,Tom Long,True,"May 6, 2011","Essentially, when the movie comes down to Earth it's pretty good. But when it spends time across the universe -- and it spends a lot of time across the universe -- it's pure geek fare. Which may thrill geeks but leave others yawning."
thor,Pete Vonder Haar,False,"May 6, 2011","Escapism doesn't have to be mindless, and comic book movies don't necessarily have to reach for some greater human truth."

thor,Steve Persall,True,"May 6, 2011","All that director Kenneth Branagh must do with Thor is not mess it up, and he succeeds. The results aren't as exhilarating as the first Iron Man, but Downey can't play every superhero...For sheer fun and action, I'd prefer seeing Fast Five again."

thor,Jason Anderson,False,"May 6, 2011",Thor's level of visual opulence is one sure indication that director Kenneth Branagh is unafraid of embracing the potential for camp inherent in any superhero blockbuster but generally avoided amid the current vogue for Dark Knight-style solemnity.

thor,Gary Thompson,True,"May 5, 2011","Branagh does what he can to add a dash of humor here and there, but so much of ""Thor"" is postproduction animation - pretty, but every object has the insubstantial feel of the digital hand."
thor,Bob Mondello,False,"May 5, 2011","In the Marvel Comics firmament, Thor qualifies a second-tier superhero, and despite its classier-than-usual director, his film's kind of second-tier too, with lavish effects and big digital battles that register as pretty routine even in 3-D."

werewolf-by-night,Dolores Quintana,False,"Dec 28, 2022","The true success of WEREWOLF BY NIGHT is that is it precisely what I did not expect from a Marvel film and from Michael Giacchino, who is best known as a fantastic composer."
werewolf-by-night,Samuel Leggett Jr.,False,"Dec 27, 2022","This was one of most violent, weird, & insanely fun rides that Marvel has ever done!

werewolf-by-night,Josh Stephenson,True,"Oct 11, 2022","Werewolf By Night is no grand sea change in the Marvel formula – and although it’s a pleasant enough tribute to the movies of Boris Karloff and co, it doesn’t come close to surpassing them. Ironically, it just doesn’t have enough bite."

werewolf-by-night,Diego Batlle,False,"Oct 7, 2022","To an extent, the TV film is derivative of The Hunger Games (with a gothic aesthetic, obviously), but in its second half, plot turns, and visual surprises raise the bar. [Full review in Spanish]"

werewolf-by-night,Jonathon Wilson,False,"Oct 7, 2022","Giacchino directs from a script by Heather Quinn and Peter Cameron that works as a throwback, a pastiche, and a diversion all at once, and you won’t see Captain America anywhere, which is perhaps just as well."

werewolf-by-night,Jeffrey Harris,False,"Oct 6, 2022","Werewolf by Night is an entertaining Marvel monster mash. As a standalone special, the program is unhindered by the continuity of past efforts, and Giacchino takes glee in introducing the monster and horror side of the Marvel Universe to the MCU."

werewolf-by-night,Ryan Leston,False,"Oct 6, 2022","Werewolf by Night may not make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up, but it will keep you on the edge of your seat with a slow, creeping tone that captures the very best of classic horror."
werewolf-by-night,James Marsh,False,"Oct 6, 2022","Kudos must be given to Marvel president Kevin Feige for allowing Giacchino creative freedom in this project, as Werewolf by Night is undeniably eccentric, and exhibits a ravenous bloodlust that would be far from fitting for an Avengers movie."

werewolf-by-night,Brad Gullickson,False,"Sep 29, 2022",Marvel’s first “Special Presentation” is a monster mash. You can sense Giacchino’s glee in each frame. He’s jammed everything he loves about the genre into one singular expression.
werewolf-by-night,Sean Chandler,False,"Sep 28, 2022","Werewolf By Night is one of MCU phase 4's biggest risks, but also one of it's most pleasant surprises. Marvel's tribute to classic monster movies is violent and refreshing.  My biggest complaint is that I wish there was more of it."
