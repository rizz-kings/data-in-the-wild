Cocaine Bear,Mark Asch,"Cocaine Bear will, in time, stand as a dated artifact of the current moment's vogue for viral animal videos and epic memes.",True
Cocaine Bear,Wenlei Ma,This is a movie that makes no apologies for trying to make you howl in laughter and disgust – at the same time.,False
Cocaine Bear,Dmitry Samarov,"Save yourself the price of admission and just watch the trailer if you haven’t already, or—better yet—make your own TikTok version. It’ll be funnier and will cost viewers a lot less time.",True
Cocaine Bear,Matthew Lickona,"Why does the bear kill everyone it meets during its drug rampage except for the one person it decides to kidnap? Why don’t people with guns shoot the bear when they have the chance? Because the movie needs to happen, that’s why!",True
Cocaine Bear,Odie Henderson,"French New Wave director Jean-Luc Godard allegedly said that all you needed for a good movie was “a girl and a gun.” If the movie is called “Cocaine Bear,” all you need is yayo and a clone of Yogi.",False
Cocaine Bear,Adam Nayman,[It] acts like it’s above the clichés it’s stringing together.,True
Cocaine Bear,Max Weiss,"The film is well made, efficient, clever, and some of its funny lines will have you, um, snorting. But in the end, it’s still about a bear on a coke binge.",False
Cocaine Bear,Matthew Monagle,Cocaine Bear is a success...by putting the emphasis on a handful of extremely gnarly kills and sprinkling in just enough weirdness to keep the entire train moving.,False
Cocaine Bear,tt stern-enzi,Incredibly funny and surprisingly gory.,False
Cocaine Bear,Kevin Maher,Elizabeth Banks takes this real-life curio and slams it up against the “killer animal” genre with mostly pleasing results.,False
Cocaine Bear,Wendy Ide,"It may not be Grizzly Man meets Scarface, but it leaves Snakes on a Plane standing on the runway.",False
Cocaine Bear,James Berardinelli,"When it works, it’s like the fusion of an ultra-violent cartoon with the Pulp Fiction scene in which Vincent Vega accidentally shoots Marvin in the face.",False
Cocaine Bear,Tyler Austin Harper,"In an atmosphere in which it is all too easy to feel suffocated by climate anxiety, Elizabeth Banks’ film cuts through our ecological malaise.",False
Cocaine Bear,Stephen Romei,"This is certainly a different film. As edgy as it is, it could have been edgier, and the plot sags a little towards the end. But with the latest Ant-Man topping the box office, it wins points just for being different.",False
Cocaine Bear,David Sims,"Cocaine Bear could’ve been a triumph if the jokes landed, but the zingers just aren’t up to the mayhem. And though the character actors are all capable of sterling work, there’s nobody to root for here.",True
Cocaine Bear,K. Austin Collins,"The pleasure’s in the crass, goopy excitement of it. It’s kind of a put-on, but the movie gets by on being surprisingly blood-soaked where it counts.",False
Cocaine Bear,Donald Clarke,"This is a rare film that extracts humour from younger teenagers shovelling down cocaine on penknives, but elsewhere the tone is closer to something produced by Steven Spielberg.",False
Cocaine Bear,Oliver Jones,The primary sin of Cocaine Bear... is its complete inability to balance the film’s twin directives of broad comedy and shock horror.,True
Cocaine Bear,Ty Burr,"While “Cocaine Bear” mostly succeeds at the task, it’s still low-end comedy-horror schlock, no more and no less.",False
Cocaine Bear,Leah Greenblatt,"In every dumb and delightful way, it's just about a bear, standing in front of the world, asking for more cocaine till she explodes.",True
Cocaine Bear,Bilge Ebiri,"Cocaine Bear is just as good as it needs to be. If it were any better, it probably couldn’t call itself Cocaine Bear.",False
Cocaine Bear,Gary M. Kramer,Many of the set pieces in director Elizabeth Banks' one-joke film are shocking because they are so boring. This film promises laughs and scares but manages to deliver neither.,True
Cocaine Bear,Esther Zuckerman,"It’s not a bad time, exactly, so long as you can tolerate copious amounts of blood. But if you’re going to do a Scarface-meets-Yogi Bear hybrid, it should have more than one note.",True
Cocaine Bear,Hannah Strong,"In the age of franchise domination and streaming service supremacy, there’s nothing quite like sitting down with a packed house to watch something outrageous on a giant screen.",False
Cocaine Bear,Glenn Kenny,"As a crass grind-house picture, the notion of a bear on a rampage after ingesting accidentally air-dropped cocaine (of 1985 grade, yet!) is solid. This is a studio picture with A-list names, and it does deliver goods.",False
Cocaine Bear,Venessa Wong,"It’s too campy and self-deprecating to be an indelible work of cinema, but that’s not the point: It’s original, and it’s a very good time.",False
Cocaine Bear,Christy Lemire,"An incredible blast, especially if you have the benefit of seeing director Elizabeth Banks’ insanely violent comedy/thriller with a packed crowd ... “Cocaine Bear” will bring people together. “Cocaine Bear” will save cinema.",False
Cocaine Bear,Jason Zinoman,"“Cocaine Bear” too often feels like a one-joke movie, stretched thin.",True
Cocaine Bear,Peter Travers,"A bear does cocaine and kills people. Director Elizabeth Banks revels in deliciously cheap thrills, but then treats her overqualified actors (Keri Russell, the late Ray Liotta) like bear chewtoys while the overcrowded script drifts into hibernation.",True
Cocaine Bear,Anthony Lane,"The excess, however gleeful, is that of a film paying anxious tribute to itself. Look, it seems to shout, here’s an apex predator becoming a homicidal junkie! What did you expect?",True
Cocaine Bear,Nick Schager,The only snorts it warrants are of the disdainful variety.,True
Cocaine Bear,Ian Freer,"It’s a great premise but, over-populated by dull characters and a flat feel, Cocaine Bear is sadly a party animal that never gets started. Not quite a coke zero but close.",True
Cocaine Bear,Charlotte O'Sullivan,"While watching Cocaine Bear, you can actually feel your IQ level tumbling. Yep, it was right up my alley. I yawned through the first act, but spent the next hour either gasping or giggling.",False
Cocaine Bear,Sara Michelle Fetters,"Cocaine Bear does not try to sell itself as something it is not. There is a bear. It is addicted to cocaine. It proceeds to kill several people. Gory, whacked-out weirdness transpires over an economical 95 minutes. That’s it. That’s the movie.",False
Cocaine Bear,Cary Darling,"Simultaneously gruesome and amusing...The film never devolves into ""Bearnado."" On the other hand, it's no ""Jaws"" either.",False
Cocaine Bear,Michael Phillips,A movie high on its own supply of mediocrity.,True
Cocaine Bear,Kyle Smith,"The supposedly wacky bits aren’t funny, Ms. Banks evinces no gifts for suspense, and the pacing is all off. It’s hard to say whether it’s the script or the direction that is more responsible for the clunky, slow feel.",True
Cocaine Bear,Mark Kennedy,"Aping other genres of filmmaking, this one never finds its own voice or a way to integrate the ultra-violence with the dark comedy. It’s like a parody of a parody that director Elizabeth Banks has turned limp and pointless.",True
Cocaine Bear,Jake Wilson,"Perhaps no actual movie could live up to the ideal simplicity of such a premise. Still, I went in with high enough hopes to be taken aback by the sheer awfulness of this campy horror-comedy.",True
Cocaine Bear,Deborah Ross,This is basically a marketing concept put on screen. And it’s not that much fun seeing a computer-generated image attack sentient beings who may as well have been made out of cardboard.,True
Cocaine Bear,Robbie Collin,Doesn’t so much insult its viewers’ intelligence as actively libel it.,True
Cocaine Bear,Bill Goodykoontz,"Absurdity is what we came for, and “Cocaine Bear” could use even more of it.",True
Cocaine Bear,Justin Chang,"“Cocaine Bear,” like most movies that turn schadenfreude into entertainment, does a reasonably good job of both scrambling and satisfying your expectations.",False
Cocaine Bear,Danny Leigh,"At the risk of sounding like a buzzkill, it does also become clear that the film has no clue what to do with its one essential gag beyond repeating it.",True
Cocaine Bear,Radheyan Simonpillai,"The movie, about a doped-up black bear, is a much more lethargic affair, as if the apex predator’s supply was swapped out for some Ativan.",True
Cocaine Bear,Adam Graham,"Cocaine Bear isn't smart dumb, it's just plain dumb.",True
Cocaine Bear,Richard Roeper,"Wildly entertaining and darkly hilarious B-movie blood-fest, which proves to be more than just a fantastically ridiculous title and a viral marketing campaign.",False
Cocaine Bear,Michael O'Sullivan,"Cocaine Bear isn’t so much a movie as an idea — a synopsis, an elevator pitch, a thumbnail description.",True
Cocaine Bear,Brian Lowry,"Give the kudos more to the concept than the movie, which mostly demonstrates, with apologies to an old marketing slogan, that things don’t always go better with coke.",True
Cocaine Bear,Nicholas Barber,"It's definitely better than Banks's last film, Charlie's Angels, but you can't help feeling that she has done the bear minimum.",True
Cocaine Bear,Mick LaSalle,"Where Cocaine Bear fails is that there is nothing to keep us watching but the spectacle of the bear attacks. We don't care if anyone survives, and we're not invited to take anything about it seriously.",True
Cocaine Bear,Lovia Gyarkye,"No thoughts, just vibes.",False
Cocaine Bear,Jude Dry,"Keri Russell and Ray Liotta add A-list appeal to this B movie cash grab, as director Elizabeth Banks proves she knows what audiences want.",False
Cocaine Bear,Saskia Lloyd Gaiger,Cocaine Bear transcends terms such as good and instantly enters the realm of beloved trash.,False
Cocaine Bear,Ellen E Jones,"There’s a class A premise for a B-movie in here, but Cocaine Bear is just too sober to get high on its own supply.",False
Cocaine Bear,Alex Welch,"A manic, headfirst dive into pure, unadulterated chaos.",False
Cocaine Bear,Soren Andersen,"As a creature feature, Cocaine Bear isn’t bad. Not great, mind you. But not bad.",False
Cocaine Bear,Johnny Oleksinski,"Impressively... director Elizabeth Banks keeps the powder gags fresh throughout, as the mammal maims her way through a Southern forest preserve.",False
Cocaine Bear,Tim Grierson,"Director Elizabeth Banks' third feature leans into the material's trashy B-movie qualities, treating this oddball crime saga as a dark comedy that is only sporadically as clever as it thinks it is.",True
Cocaine Bear,Brian Truitt,Cocaine Bear only asks that you love the B-movie beauty and its fabulous beast.,False
Cocaine Bear,Paul Attard,Cocaine Bear starts running on fumes almost immediately and peters out before the second brick of cocaine is even devoured.,True
Cocaine Bear,Clarisse Loughrey,"It’s bloody and grotesque, at times quite dark, but also surprisingly endearing.",False
Cocaine Bear,Alonso Duralde,"Never sacrifices the laughs for dramatic tension, nor vice versa, and those are very tricky plates to spin over the course of a feature film.",False
Cocaine Bear,Meagan Navarro,"Cocaine Bear struggles to sustain its euphoric highs and not all choices work. But the irreverent, zany fun, the underlying tenderness toward the characters, and a deeply committed cast ensure crowd-pleasing, unhinged entertainment will be had.",False

Spider-Man: No Way Home,Steven D. Greydanus,Crossover comfort food with a redemptive twist.,False
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Liz Shannon Miller,"Throughout all of it, the weird and complex history of Spider-Man as a cinematic icon isn't a hindrance to the story; instead, it's an enhancement, using the quirks of the character's legacy as a source of illumination into why he has endured so long.",False
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Allegra Frank,The movie allows for a surprisingly impactful reappraisal of a long-held Spidey franchise consensus.,False
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Anupama Chopra,"This film is fan service at its best because even us, casual lovers, can enjoy the ride.",False
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Damian Levy,"Dafoe and Molina are the scene stealers in the movie, with a special mention to Dafoe for bringing back the terror he gave me at the age of 6.",False
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Christy Lemire,"This movie's a total blast, but it's also surprisingly emotional at times, too.",False
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Richard Whittaker,"So often in these big multi-villain events, the hero gets swallowed up, but here he defines the film.",False
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Oliver Jones,A film destined to be enthusiastically embraced by both old-school web slinger junkies and fans of the multi-film corporate franchise in which he is currently ensnared.,False
Spider-Man: No Way Home,John Wenzel,"Despite Marvel's usual bloat and a swirling storm of characters, ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" earns its joy and sorrow with thematic substance, the breathless action often contrasted with quiet reflection and grief.",False
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Sandra Hall,"It's a form of breaking the fourth wall, inviting the audience in to share a joke with the actors, and verges on parody. Yet somehow they carry it off without diluting our sense of involvement with Peter and those he loves.",False
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Wendy Ide,"An overflowing, funnel-web cornucopia of treats for Spider-fans.",False
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Nicholas Barber,"No Way Home isn't just about looking back at old films. It also opens up new avenues for the Marvel Universe - or the Marvel Multiverse, to be more accurate.",False

Spider-Man: No Way Home,Clarisse Loughrey,It reaches a point at which the division between sincerity and cynicism doesn't seem to matter much anymore - it will work for the right people. And that is an art in itself.,False
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Bilge Ebiri,"While the previous Holland films have been mediocre in modest ways, No Way Home feels downright aggressive in its mediocrity...",True
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Helen O'Hara,"Spider-Man is always best on the back foot, and this film puts him thoroughly through the wringer. But it also gives him room to shine, and packs an emotional punch that could floor any of his villains.",False
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Peter Travers,"Tom Holland is better than ever in his surprise-packed, third solo outing as a teen hero in a onesie who's out to save the world and a faltering pandemic box office. But this time the generic thrills are tempered with genuine emotion. Good one, Spidey.",False
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Rafer Guzman,"Short on story, long on insider humor, this Spidey entry marks a sudden drop-off in quality.",True
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Mark Feeney,"You don't need to have seen any of the previous Spider-Man movies to follow this one. But it's much more entertaining - more affecting, too - if you have.",False
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Linda Marric,"A bombastic, crowdpleaser which is sharp, funny and just as chaotic as its titular character. Like a bratpack movie, it's a film about growing up, knowing one's place in the world and appreciating it for what it is.",False

Spider-Man: No Way Home,Manohla Dargis,"Like almost every Marvel production, this one is too long and, at two and a half hours, overstays its welcome. But before that, the movie nicely snaps and pops.",False
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Caroline Siede,"It's an intriguing idea -- paving a new Spidey future by interrogating our collective Spidey past. Still, it's one that will probably play best for those already invested in the Spider-Verse, rather than those just swinging by.",False
Spider-Man: No Way Home,David Sims,It's a hectic series of plot twists and deus ex machinas that overturns an entire bucket of action figures and smashes them all together with delight. The film might be a new nadir of cinema -- but it's also an undeniably watchable good time.,False
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Chris Hewitt,"It's called ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" but a better title for this exhausting sequel would be ""Spider-Man: For Superfans Only.""",True
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Scott Tobias,"The MCU is a high-floor/low-ceiling enterprise, and No Way Home is slightly closer to the ceiling than the floor, exactly like all the other Spider-Man movies.",False

Spider-Man: No Way Home,Michael Phillips,"Casting Tom Holland as Peter Parker was one of the sharper decisions to emerge from the ever-present, oxygen-sucking Marvel Cinematic Universe. What a business model!",False

Spider-Man: No Way Home,Mick LaSalle,"The filmmakers put their faith in a character, not fireworks, and the result is big blockbuster that feels more like a sweet little movie.",False
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Moira MacDonald,"Those who meticulously study the Marvel universe will find lots to happily debate here, but those of us with a more casual connection to superhero movies will simply have a rollicking good time.",False
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Jake Coyle,"Its tone leans more operatic than antic. Still, Watts has a human touch that can be lacking in superhero films, and nearly all of the actors who appear in No Way Home""come across as individuals despite the high-concept narrative.",False
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Adam Graham,"Watts, who also helmed the previous two chapters in the series, mixes humor, action and human moments well, and he keeps the film moving nimbly, despite its nearly two-and-a-half hour running time.",False

Spider-Man: No Way Home,Brian Tallerico,"No Way Home is crowded, but it's also surprisingly spry, inventive, and just purely entertaining.",False
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Barry Hertz,Spider-Man: No Way Home is both a gigantic act of franchise-mad hubris and a ridiculous amount of fun.,False
Spider-Man: No Way Home,A.A. Dowd,No Way Home's extended exercise in franchise-agnostic fan service is at once an ominous precedent for future event movies and an at-times rather poignant gimmick.,False
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Nick Schager,The finest wall-crawling MCU effort to date.,False
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Richard Lawson,"Holland has built a legacy that will long linger in the Spider-Man firmament; better he should place it on the mantle now than wear out his welcome. The odds of that actually happening are, of course, slim to none.",False
