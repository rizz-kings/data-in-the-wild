Cocaine Bear,Kenneth R,This movie had no business being this funny! I enjoyed every minute!,5
Cocaine Bear,Jo & Co,"Cocaine Bear was dreadful in every single department. Jo and I are avid cinema goers. We are both OLD! Our ages range from 79 - 88. I cannot remember such a terrible movie. the acting started out bad and, even though we thought it was impossible - it got worse.

It was hailed as a horror/comedy. Neither was evident. ""It is loosely inspired by the true story of the ""Cocaine Bear"", an American black bear that ingested nearly 75 lb (34 kg) of lost cocaine"" - Wikipedia.

Sadly, even Ray Lotta - an actor I have loves, especially playing villains, was bad. Even worse this movie was dedicated to him as he died soon after the movie was made. He also died (acted) in this awful movie.

I am amazed that on Rotten Tomatoes 67% of 299 critics' reviews are positive!! They had to have been watching a different version. The only thing I can agree with is at the 2023 MTV Movie & TV Awards, Cocaine Bear was nominated for Best Villain (the bear)!

Both of us were hoping the bear would devour every single actor in this movie - way before the hour and a half of the scheduled running time of the movie. He very nearly did!",1
Cocaine Bear,ARo,"An entertaining movie with equal parts gore and giggles.  I'd watch it again.  ""Based on a true story"" is a bit of a stretch, but I guess that's artistic license.",3
Cocaine Bear,Jennie C,One of the best dumbest movies yet!,4
Cocaine Bear,Hector,"Interesting plot , different - not what I was expecting - but still good üòäüëç",4
Cocaine Bear,Geraldine E G,was great movie some comedy was like the story line and made me jump out of my seat a couple of times,4

Cocaine Bear,Alejandro Robles,"Great, hilarious movie with dope cinematography all around.",5
Cocaine Bear,The Goose,"This is one of the dumbest movies I've seen in a while, but it is so much fun. What's written on the package is what you get.",5
Cocaine Bear,Mamatee,Super stupidity funny. Enjoyed it,5
Cocaine Bear,Douglas,"I found it funny, but also very graphic in violence. Not for the squeamish.",4

Cocaine Bear,pete,"Had some very funny scenes and also some very gross ones, but all over the top.",4
Cocaine Bear,JD,Fucked up but hilarious. Hard to watch some scenes,5
Cocaine Bear,Teresa,About the only thing it had going for it was the fact its based on a true story. I thot a lot of the acting was pretty subpar and semi amateur at times.,3
Cocaine Bear,Jessica,very funny movie not for kids but hilarious for adults,5
Cocaine Bear,Wendy,About what I expected. Wish is would have been funny.,3
Cocaine Bear,Robert,It was better then I expected it to be.,5

Cocaine Bear,Stephen K,A horror movie with funny twists.,4
Cocaine Bear,Don,Dirty words lots of blood and guts  not much of a story line,2
Cocaine Bear,Yako,"I thought the kids were extremely funny in the movie, I also appreciated the talent that was involved and like seeing familiar actors. The only thing that got me that I liked and also disliked at the same time was that it was far fetched but it also worked to keep attention. Weather all was believable I am not sure because I have never heard of this situation before the movie. I would recommend and watch movie again, it does blow my mind and keep me thinking :)",3
Cocaine Bear,Kimani,Could have been funnier. Didn‚Äôt have me at the end of my seat,2
Cocaine Bear,gabs,"Everything I could have wanted from cocaine bear, and then some.",5
Cocaine Bear,Holly,It was funny but too gory at times!,4
Cocaine Bear,Toni,"I loved it, but I have a pretty dry, off the wall sense of humor.  For me, it had the right combination of elements of surprise plot twists, great characters, gore and off the wall humor.  I would watch it again!",5
Cocaine Bear,Doris Hull,"A few funny parts, way too much gore. Overall did not hold my (nor most people in the theaters) attention. Would NOT recommend!",1
Cocaine Bear,Corey B,"I figured this would be a story slightly more intricate than a homicidal bear on cocaine, but I was wrong.  It was very entertaining and gives you what it says it will.",3
Cocaine Bear,Patricia Williamson,I really enjoyed it. Great Movie,4
Cocaine Bear,Diana H,By far the worst movie Ive seen in a long time! The acting was terrible and the graphics are sub-par!,1
Cocaine Bear,Renee H,"Tasteless, gross and hilarious. Ill see it again!",4
Cocaine Bear,Steven,"Terrible storyline, terrible special effects, plot was very predictable.  Worst movie around .",1
Cocaine Bear,Mark S,I enjoyed the pace of the movie.  I enjoyed the silliness and I enjoyed the nature scenes.,3

Cocaine Bear,Jennifer,"Hilarious, insane, bloody, and just a simple entertaining movie.",5

Cocaine Bear,Nathaniel M,Needed more cocaine bear.,4
Cocaine Bear,Robert,"The trailer was funny but beware, the movie itself is dumb and gratuitously violent. I would not have gone if Id known how stupid it was. Dave your money and your time.",1
Cocaine Bear,Kirk D,It was a gruesome biography,1
Cocaine Bear,Teresa,It was the worst movie ever,0
Cocaine Bear,Kelly,Not at all what the commercials made it seem - it had some funny parts but there was just ok much blood in my oponion,2
Cocaine Bear,Liza,"some parts were cool, but most scenes hung on way too long. This really could've been a shorter movie. it's on that bad but not really worth the time.",2
Cocaine Bear,Maddie,I‚Äôve seen it 3 times already and honestly will probably watch again for a 4th time. 100/10 movie,5
Cocaine Bear,Kensley J,I liked the movie and it definitely had funny moments and minor gory moments. I will say it was a very chaotic movie in how the plot moves along but other than that I liked it,3
Cocaine Bear,Google,"It was entertaining, the side stories were decent and it had some pretty humorous parts.",3
Cocaine Bear,First L,"This is going to be a terrible way for Ray Liotta to be remembered. B movie not withstanding, groan.",1
Cocaine Bear,Anonymous,Movie tried too hard to be funny,0
Cocaine Bear,Thomas,"Too much unnecessary cursing!!!!!!! I get so frustrated with movies that use so much cursing. If the writers have no more imagination than that, they need to resign! I prefer no cursing at all but I can tolerate a word or two, here and there, but when every line of the script has so much vulgarity  You could cut out all of the curse words and the movie would be 45 minutes shorter!!! 
The bear looked obviously animated in several places. 
Too much blood, guts and gore!!!",0
Cocaine Bear,Kip,It is definitely not a comedy. Gore. That is fine if you aren't going to a show expecting humour.,1
Cocaine Bear,Taylor,didn‚Äôt let me watch itüñïüèª,0
Cocaine Bear,R&B,Just didnt seem realistic,2
Cocaine Bear,Alex,something different. very funny.,5
Cocaine Bear,Suavecito,"I am not sure how rate this film?
I was wickedly funny and dark.  not sure if this movie was a comedy or scary movie or documentary???  it was different for me to say the least.",3
Cocaine Bear,Jax,Intestines looked sausageüëéüèæ,4
Cocaine Bear,Brutus,Thought it would be funnier.  One of those movies where most of the best bits were in the trailer.  It is a hard R for the gore. Looking for that breakout comedy? look elsewhere.,2
Cocaine Bear,Aaron M,Was very funny and entertaining had a great time R.I.P. Ray Liotta,5
Cocaine Bear,Ori S,Good movie really funny!!!! Stupid name but a great movie,5
Cocaine Bear,Claus,"Bad plot, and bad graphics. If they tried to go to the ""absurd"" realm (like the parody on Scream), they didn't hyperbolize enough.",1
Cocaine Bear,Garrett,Pretty good and funny movie,3
Cocaine Bear,Ruben,"Not what you would expect , in a good way",5

Cocaine Bear,Kimberly,Worst movie I have ever seen. If I could give zero stars I would. Wish I hadn't of wasted my money on this movie.,1
Cocaine Bear,Trailgaiter,"Kinda corny and predictable, but a few good laughs. I'm glad I saw it. The 'R' rating is only for the gore and language, no nudity or sex.",3
Cocaine Bear,Mary D,it was boring gory violence i did'nt expect thought he was just going to be a funny movie,0
Cocaine Bear,leslie,Meh it passed the time,2
Cocaine Bear,Adam B,Better than I expected but Elizabeth Banks needs to work on her comedy writing.,3
Cocaine Bear,Jackie,Worst movie Ive ever seen! Not even remotely funny and just plain gross.,0
Cocaine Bear,michael p,"We were ready to go half way through it. The novelty of it wore off quickly. Very much a B rated movie with poor writing and acting that quite frankly didn't make much sense half the time. Let the humor in this help you make it to the end ! Sorry, had big hopes for this one from the previews .",2
Cocaine Bear,turquoise j,"Funny, unpredictable.",5
Cocaine Bear,Google,Stupid and violent trying to be humorous,2
Cocaine Bear,Nick,It was funny and gory ! Good stoner movie,3
Cocaine Bear,Russell,"It was worth the watch but nothing too special.  I didn't think it was going to be so bloody, but it was still fun and funny.",3
Cocaine Bear,Random Movie Goer,"It had a very strong beginning and solid characters, but it fell apart a bit near the end. The actual ending was also a bit disappointing, but what are you gonna do? Its a true story its not like it could have been changed.",2
Cocaine Bear,Margaret,It was terrible. Thought it was going to turn out to be a comedy. It was not!,1

Cocaine Bear,Pat,Hilarious horror movie.,5
Cocaine Bear,Henrietta  G,IT WAS FABULOUS!! LOVED IT!!,5
Cocaine Bear,Brenda,It was VERY gory and the language was not necessary!,3
Cocaine Bear,Teddy Z,"to be honest, I went in expecting ridiculousness, and while I wasn't disappointed of its craziness, it was humorous at times, bit gorey moments, some sad & adorable moments, and quite a few WTH moments as you pan between multiple characters throughout the movie

overall, not a bad movie, just don't over think things, don't give animals unperscribed drugs, and just enjoy it for the craziness that it is",4
Cocaine Bear,Tiffany M,Had its funny moments but somehow still missed the mark.,3
Cocaine Bear,Thomas D,"We would not have seen this movie if it hadn't been for my husband's prodding as he heard it had gotten good reviews.  I went along unenthusiastically.  Well, to my surprise, I absolutely LOVED it.  If you are a Fargo fan, think ""quirky"" characters that will make you laugh through the entire movie (except for the gory parts, of course).  One couple did get up and leave the theater when the first human leg was sacrificed to the bear!!!",5
Cocaine Bear,Monika,It was entertaining...,2
Cocaine Bear,Kentuck,"Comedian Tony Baker said it best. when you go to see cocaine bear, leave your brain at home. If you like a bear fill with cocaine and going on a killing spree, this movie is for you. I enjoy the movie and I definitely left my brain at home.",3
Cocaine Bear,Nancy D,It's a gruesome fun ride!,4
Cocaine Bear,Allie,"3.4/5 stars!! Its everything I expected it to be, it was hilarious. Corny acting along with editing mistakes, but it made it so much better.",3
Cocaine Bear,Marianna L,Not a movie I would recommend- it‚Äôs silly and there‚Äôs hardly a plot to follow,2
Cocaine Bear,Danielle,Silly funny horror movie,3
Cocaine Bear,Jessie,Horror and comedy in one loved it,5
Cocaine Bear,JACOBY M,Wish there was more scenes wit the bear,3
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Connor,Nostalgic enough to make you want to rate it a 5. Although the overall flow of the movie was pretty disappointing. The Spider-man humor was there and great as usual.,4

Spider-Man: No Way Home,Jeffrey W,A fantastic superhero flick through and through.,5
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Nicholas K,"Good movie, completely saved by returning cast from previous eras of Spider-Man cinema. Without them this movie would not be worth price of admission. Also, make The Amazing Spider-Man 3 with Andrew Garfield and Marc Webb, Sony!",3
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Kelvis,Have seen it more than 2 times already! A must watch!,5
Spider-Man: No Way Home,GrantGG,"Amazing, me and all my buds went together, great time!",5
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Snafu,"Ahh, this movie is still as amazing the 4th time around as it was the 1st time watching. The additional scenes don't really add much except a few extra laughs. But overall, still an amazing experience and an amazing heroes journey for Spider-Man.",5

Spider-Man: No Way Home,Leo,"Liked the fact that all the original characters were back, but story was weak",3

Spider-Man: No Way Home,robertmarraattnet,Fast moving for a long film.,4
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Gregory,"The movie was amazing. It was entertaining and worth seeing a second time. The actors were brilliant especially Tom, Toby, and Andrew also the villains were awesome especially Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, and the others. The extended cut was wonderful.",5
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Dominic,Even better the second time! üï∑üï∏,5
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Jason,five out of fiveWOOOOOOOOS.,5
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Shannon S,"Spider-Man: No Way Home is already a near perfect superhero film. This extended cut is a welcome return with a few new bells and whistles. I wouldn‚Äôt say it does a lot to make a great film better, but the added bits do give it a few more moments to connect with the characters and expands on the obstacles they encountered. Especially in the earlier parts of the story. If you weren‚Äôt already a fan of the film then the extended cut isn‚Äôt really going to do much to change your mind. If you were already a fan of this outing of the Spider-Man franchise then you will likely appreciate the scenes that expand a little more on different points in the story. And for what it‚Äôs worth, all the same parts in the film that hit me in the feels from my previous viewings still hit here.",5
Spider-Man: No Way Home,James E,Great movie. I enjoyed all the cameos from the older movies. Spiderman is my favorite Marvel character and I'm glad the movie rights are still with Sony.,5
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Drew,Not much of an addition with the barely 12 minutes of new screen footage. Most seemed to come with the on campus interviews that were meh. Still loved the film and will be watching it again soon! Still could have used more of the 3 peters interacting.,5
Spider-Man: No Way Home,TriciaD,Great action. Loved the Spidie trio,5
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Ken S,"This was probably my favorite Spider Man movie of all, at least so far. Great plot, great acting, great fun!",5
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Nick,"An amazing film. Fun and funny. Still makes me cry on the second viewing. Well-placed, fantastic visuals, great acting. Worth seeing again!",5
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Jonathan,Definitely a must see movie,5

Spider-Man: No Way Home,David,"There is a lot of story here. You will be unable to appreciate it all if you have not seen all of the spiderman movies previous to this one. That being said, the story is intriguing, and provides for a number of future movies.",4
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Kathie,"I was confused initially about the context. I had not seen any previews or read anything about the movie so I went into it blind. Some of the shots weee obvious over a green screen but I eventually figured out that it was supposed to look that way because it was a high school broadcast. The supposed real new anchor was hokey. With all that said, when the other two supermen showed up, now that was a surprise and so cool. I was hooked from there to the end and really loved the rest of the movie and story line.",4
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Armando,Loved the movie! Cannot go wrong with this movie! A big part I loved was having the authenticity of characters and their family! Loved the Filipino grandma scene! Made me miss my Nanay!,5

Spider-Man: No Way Home,Hunter,Incredible movie the second time around. Great theater. A lovely experience as always.,5
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Rodney B,"Still amazing, still Spectacular, still hits home. one thing I will say is that there was some stuff added, but not the more fun stuff. don't expect to much or you'll be disappointed, but expect and accept that this still is and always will be, one of the greatest films of all time",5
Spider-Man: No Way Home,Matt Murdock Simp,Matt Murdockkkkkkkkk those extra few seconds were WORTH IT I will simp for him until the end of time.  If they release a third version with even just 1 more second of Matt Murdock I will pay infinite amount of money to see him,5
