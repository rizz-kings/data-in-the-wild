{"movie": "avengers-endgame", "user": "DannyDumb", "score": "10", "date": "FEB 7, 2022", "text": "ow do you make a fitting end to an 11-year buildup? The answer I think all filmmakers are looking for is Avengers: Endgame. This was a perfect balance (ha) of funny and soul-crushing. It followed our remaining avengers (and rocket and nebula) that were spared the snap in infinity war. The acting, as always, is on point from everyone involved, and let's be honest: we could never predict what was going to happen. I think the biggest curveball thrown at us fans was the scene where Captain America picks up Mjolnir. We all saw him attempt to lift it in Avengers: Age of Ultron, but we never thought they were going to revisit that again. I don't think I blinked or took a breath the whole 3 hours. It felt really short in the end because this movie never dragged. The last thing I wanna talk about is the choices they made with some of the characters. I was very surprised that they made Thor fat, but he wasn't comic relief because of it, which I really liked. He was still badass but had a lot more grief from losing all of his friends from the snap attached to his character. Also, hulk's transformation into Bruce-Hulk is one of the most surprising things. He also got to do the honors of bringing everyone back when they went to the alternate timelines because of: Scott Lang! about him: since he was on house arrest during infinity war and he was stuck in the quantum realm after the snap happened, I'm so glad we got to see him use his idea to essentially, save the universe. And Black Widow: Oh My Gosh, was I sad when she died. I always thought of her as the most complicated character of the Avengers. The Russo brothers did an amazing job of not killing her off too quickly, and, before being sacrificed, she got to have some really solid character development. And finally: Tony Stark. Wow. What a ride it has been for him. Fighting his way out of that cave in Iron Man 1, and now saving the universe and bringing harmony in Avengers: Endgame. Robert Downey Jr. has done a stellar job acting as Tony Stark, and the sendoff was appropriate for a hero that we will always come to respect."},

Time travel is introduced (so prepare to suspend your sense of disbelief even more) to go back in time, get the Infinity Stones and bring back everyone who got snapped away!

It starts out with Tony Stark (Iron Man) and Nebula stranded in space. He sends out a distress call, and Captain Marvel (Who, I admit, is too overpowered) saves them both. They soon return to Earth, where the remaining Avengers, are there. They later find out that Thanos is using the infinity stones to destroy the tones themselves. After a little talking, Thor, who is angry since half of the universe is dead because he didn't go for the head, has enough of Thanos' voice and abruptly chops off his head. 5 years later, all the Avengers are split up and depressed. Suddenly, though, Ant Man gets released from the quantum realm by accident. He gets excited and tells the Avengers that they can do time travel since the quantum realm is a dimension that can slow or speed up time. He eventually gets all the Avengers to get the Avengers to come except one. Thor. They travel to New Asgard and find that his home is invaded by a fat, drunk man, who is Thor himself. They eventually convince him to join them by saying \"there's wine on the ship.\" Anyways, they fired up the time portal, and off they went. They all succeeded in getting all the stones back, except for Nebula's team. She get's spotted by the 2012 Thanos, Gamora, and Nebula herself from the past. Thanos finds out his future and launches an attack on the Avengers, who have all 6 infinity stones. Eventually, the Avengers snap before Thanos comes. It takes a while, but eventually, Thanos comes. Gamora has small talk with Nebula from the future, and Nebula tells everthing that has happened between 2012 through present day. She stops the Nebula from 2012, who has a desire to impress Thanos, and shoot her. Thanos brings an army of soldiers and ships, who have many more monsters inside, but then all the Avengers that have been snapped away by Thanos in INFINITY WAR come back from the Quantum Realm. They have an epic fight, and the makeshift infinity Gauntlet falls from the hand of Thanos. it becomes like a football game after Peter Parker picks it up and plays keep away. The movie comes to a climatic end when Tony Stark gets the gauntlet and snaps away thanos and his army, which kills him. Then, after Tony's funeral, Captain America puts the stones away. When comes back, he is very old, since while in the quantum realm, he met the love of his life. Overall, this was a really good movie with a lot of juicy details and battles, using the topic of time travel, and having the same old general humor that the Marvel characters have."},

Reverse time and bring everyone back alive, end of story! I hate that Captain Marvel didn't save the day like she was supposed too. I hate that they women had a small part in this movie and I'm not a feminist. They made it an Iron Man and Captain America movie. Then nobody could take down Thanos? Come man, you use his weaknesses to take him down. The reason people ran to see this movie because they wanted to see what happens. I'm very disappointed. I felt like this was rushed to make a dime off of hard core fans. I gave it two stars because the war at the end was the best part! The End!"},

Especially the absolute silly she scenes eyerolls pretty much just barely keeping you awake at this point. Thanos character is inconsistent and stripped down let alone others in the movie. Plenty of plot holes and sub plots that are just to rubbish to expand on. The last movie was much better and I'm sure many needed the enjoyment of closure around the story. But a stained finish to the marvel seris really and kinda left out a movie for everyone.

It's amazing for a huge movie to be so self-aware of itself, as well as, the movie genres that they're overtly borrowing from. The minor characters or those not even in Avengers: Infinity War, step up and help set up huge sequences that are highly entertaining and actually answer questions. Avengers: Endgame acknowledges every aspect of the characters emotions in their previous MCU film's and succeeds in the most Meta way possible. Ant-Man is a major reason for this. It's no spoiler to say that he's in the film as he produces some of the biggest laughs from the trailer of him ringing the bell at the Avenger's front gate. It's Paul Rudd's wry jokes, quick timing and fish out of water facial expressions that really assist things. The pacing of Avengers: Endgame is amazing and not for the reasons you might think. It's brilliantly paced, but it throws the entire formula and how MCU films are done on their head. Battle, loss, battle, loss, humor and then victory, take those ingredients, shake well and you've got a loose description of some average superhero films. If Avengers: Infinity War left you feeling betrayed and bummed out, I feel you. Avengers: Endgame more than makes up for any ill feelings that it caused. I see why they played it the way they did, and doing so any other way would've cheapened the film, watered down the MCU and made it all disposable. It is also worth noting that the film balance lots of humor with the drama, all the while putting it in a nice bow with stones. What we're left with is a 10 year opus that spans more arcs than Lord of the Rings and encapsulates it all in a perfect manner. Granted, they will still make many MCU films, this is not their swan song. However, there is a victory lap feeling about Avengers: Endgame. It respects the fans, adds to the dramatic elements, answers questions that fans have wondered about and plants a couple new seeds to grow on."},

Directors Joe and Anthony Russo have done a tremendous job in managing so many dozens of characters and making a great movie. Let me start with the bad news. Endgame isn't as impactful as Infinity War, because the 1st movie's Snap that erased countless living beings is about to be undone. Another reason for this is Thanos. In the 1st movie he was a perfectly balanced and well-written villain with a human side. In the latest movie he's been reduced to another blood-thirsty criminal, no different than Ronan the Accuser or Red Skull. I expected to see some more character development and backstory for Thanos, but there was none of that. Still Thanos proves to be more than a match for the heroes in combat, much more so than in Infinity War. Apart from Thanos, everything else in this movie is almost perfect. This is the culmination of 10 years and 21 MCU movies' worth of storytelling. The stakes are so high that nearly every MCU character joins the fight against Thanos' armies. I even expected to see the Kree, the Skrulls, and other cosmic beings such as Dormammu or the Celestials (it has happened in the comics) join the fight against Thanos as well because he's the biggest threat to the Universe, but I guess it would have been too much to ask for. The final battle is as chaotic as those of the Lord of the Rings or other epic blockbuster movies, with a satisfying ending nonetheless. But Endgame is not just fierce battles and non-stop violence. There is plenty of personal drama and tragedies happening, too. Characters confront their past and make amends with it. Others have to grief and keep going. But there is also tons of comedy and fun stuff, as you'd expect from an MCU movie. I could go on and on but I'd spoil things. The myriads of past comic book story references are impressive and touching. Kudos to the many actors involved. Everyone did their best job in this genre-defining movie. But most importantly, the audience in the cinema hall cheered, screamed, \"oooh\"-ed and cried multiple times during the film's many important scenes. Particularly during the late Stan Lee's seemingly last ever cameo. That sense of community and \"we are in it together\" kind of feeling is not something usually found in other movies. Avengers: Endgame isn't the end for the MCU though. It's like the season finale of a TV series before the next one is broadcast later on. It's an episode where things calm down after the climax and story threads are wrapped up before the next adventure begins. The MCU will continue, but Marvel have yet to reveal their plans for the future. For now, there is the Spider-Man: Far From Home movie to wait for."},

The Russos and the whole team offered a beautiful performance from the beginning to the end, the first Marvel giving me out tears (Nat and Tony's deaths were too much). Well, 11 years, what a beautiful legacy, a movie painting a portrait of what has been done before and concluding it on a very classy way. I found back the shivers I had watching the first Avengers in theatre, back on what made the MCU. Incredible, astonishing, the story ends and offer a perfect solution and after reading many and many theories, they succeeded in offering something satisfying. However, the movie isn't, of course, perfect and I found the humour a bit heavy and especially disappointed by the treatment of Thor in this movie (am I the only one believing it wasn't funny and necessary ?). I'm impressed by the way they were able to place Captain Marvel on a very strong position without giving the impression that she took away all the importance around the Original Avengers. The battle scene is incredible, a bit messy but so satisfying and they offer a greater copy than the one in IW in my opinion, where I was lost at some moments and clearly better than Civil War (don't hate me, I was very disappointed by the movie) , the superhero movie with clear problems of camera management (oh god the airport scene) that many people still enjoyed (not wanting to hate on it, it wasn't a bad movie, enjoyable but very poor in its choices). To conclude, I enjoyed Endgame, definitely one of my favourite MCU movie and what an ending! Congratulations Marvel, the Russos, Kevin Feige, all the teams behind the movies, all the cast, RDJ (what would we be without him), Chris Evans (who finally has his dance :)), Chris Hemsworth (wasn't always a pleasure with your movies and I'm disappointed by your treatment in Endgame, bye pal), Jeremy Renner (what a pleasure to see you back on the wheels), Scarlett Johansson (you progressed so much from useless female figure to ahhhhhhhh really heartbreaking character with your death RIP, I'm waiting to your personal movie), Mark Ruffalo (not having the tattoo grrrrr, very happy to seeing him back with Hulk) and the boss, the hero RDJ (what would it be without him, starting from the bottom and now he is here, what an ending for him, my tears went out for it !

All jokes aside,Avengers Endgame is a beautiful movie that somehow still puts the entire population in the world (Infinity War being just an anticipation of that) as main leads,and still make it a time at the theater full of poetry. Poetry that,for a Marvel movie,is still surrounded by sheer “MCU Formula” stupidity. Not as a whole,though. For a story that lasts 3h2’,this manages to go by pretty fast,like a 50 Minute TV Show Finale,even for one that deals with the casualties that Infinity War had,and just like final franchise movies,they mention almost the entire MCU,right down to the first Iron Man movie being an instrument for the story. The story goes by just like you thought it would go,and much more. Yes,there’s Time Travel (I’m allowed to say it,because other critics mentioned it),yes,there’s the traditional Marvel Formula (even if it lasts for,like,15 minutes in this hulking bowl of Seriousness) and it has a pretty easy structure to follow,which is surprising,considering that 3000 Characters and Time Travel in a Franchise movie are the recipe for a Box Office Flop. Several times they either repeat the same ole’ moment from *Insert MCU Movie name here* or they hint at that. Come to think of it,the structure of the story goes just like how Tony Stark has a great idea and it goes south real fast (remember Age Of Ultron? Good times…). The score by Alan Silvestri is alongside Thor Ragnarok and Black Panther at being the best MCU Score. At parts,it’s reminiscent of Forrest Gump (with the gratuitous melodramatic Violin or a piece mostly composed with Violins like the Theme or “They’re Sending Me To Vietnam”),and like every Final Movie in a Franchise,there are pieces from IW that are repeated in here (“Undying Fidelity”,”Even For You”,there’s a few...). If it has a shot at it (and unless another movie blows me away with that),this better have a Best VFX nom at the Oscars. So many pretty things (and CGI) to talk about in here that I can’t because it’s “Oh So Spoilery!”. But not everything is flawless,as this movie has some flaws that pissed me off A LOT. The First Act of the movie is enjoyable,but there are 2 jokes where they try to modernize it,to the point to where I’ve never thought a Marvel Movie could beat Ferdinand for a Dab joke (and you know I despise those things SO GODDAMN MUCH),and every minute of its runtime is pure Fan Wish Fulfillment,with a big,loud,bombastic 3rd Act that’ll make Nerds real happy. Just let me watch a movie,I don’t need a quote from a comic every 3 Seconds! Thanos got downgraded from the biggest threat of the MCU to “still threatening,but kind of an imbecile”. They try to make him as hateable as someone like Drago Bloodvist (from the How To Train Your Dragon series),but it ends up being a traditional ethic villain that threatens (I MEAN IT) to destroy the entire Galaxy with everything he has (a snap is not enough,huh?),with one decision in general that kinda made me angry,but still hope it’ll improve upon rewatch. Also,if you’re planning on an IMAX watch,see it in 2D,not in 3D. I almost had a headache for 3 hours of 3D Superhero Brawling. But,aside from the jokes,what is there to really complain about? Just for too much Comedy and brutal decisions,I can see someone hating it a-la Last Jedi. SO MANY RISKS TAKEN IN HERE AND I LOVED EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. But still,I had a great time,you’ll have a blast,your family and friends will,and everyone else will enjoy this epic conclusion in a Franchise that,ironically,half the world grew to love as time went by. This ain’t no Spider-Verse,but it’s the best thing the MCU could offer. Besides,I finally got to see an Audience bursting to tears (one girl holding them),so that’s a Big Plus for me. :-D"},

This is a movie that understands its audience and fans, trying to give each character's story closure without forgetting to provide valuable entertainment for the whole crowd. It also might be a tad too cheesy for some people's taste, particularly when there's a comedic relief scene. My biggest concern coming into this movie was the insertion of bland and uninspired jokes that plagued my overall solid experience in \"Infinity War\". This film was an improvement in that regard but it isn't without its cringe-inducing moments. Things like the \"Fortnite\" scene (and more than that I won't say) just made me roll my eyes. It's unbelievable how they manage to overkill it with these comedic scenes that are so painfully unnecessary and do nothing to advance the plot. I understand that you're trying to make your audience have a good time and all, but this is just unbearable. Other than that, the comedy - I thought - worked just nicely for the most part. The jokes that existed didn't ruin the tension. The characters were very central in this movie. Some characters shined; others not so much. I didn't like \"Captain Marvel\" and I certainly don't like the titular character, so I was grateful that she was underused in this movie. Everytime she's on screen and she smiles at the camera, it feels as though the actress is trying to show charisma, but there's none whatsoever. Not that the actress is awful - it's simply that she is not as interesting as the writers are portraying her to be. I know some critics enjoyed Chris Hemsworth's performance and the character, but it's sad to see that the character is reduced to a comedic relief (again). The movie also boasts an impressive budget, with so many set-pieces and computer-generated effects to be observed. This element of the movie provided the writers with so many angles to explore the story. While \"Avengers: Endgame\" is three hours long, the narrative is entertaining enough to overcome the more stale sequences. The movie never feels dull and it keeps you in the edge of your seat. I had a fun time watching it. 7/10."},

To cap it all off, the movie has insane re-watchability, an uncommon trait in most MCU movies, meaning I'll probably be buying this movie on home media as well. While the massive 3 hour runtime could have been cut/streamlined slightly (namely in the first act) and the logic of an important part of the plot is a bit confusing (no spoilers), Endgame absolutely makes up for it by providing one of the most epic, powerful, and fun cinema experiences I've ever had."},

(In the beginning of Movie he kills Thanos the inevitable who has lost all the stones and leaving alone in a planet after the destruction now the movie is all about going back to how it was before Thanos) Movie starts with stony stark being in space, then Captain Marvel comes all the way rescues him. Total movie is based on time travel and setting everything back in place, ant man is the guy who gives the plan of time travel where they go back and collect all the stones and defeat Thanos the inevitable. Movie has lot of curse words and sentences from all the superheros. Humour is always seen with Hulk and Thor, not to miss Iron man and Spider man here. So it is technically all the heros go to the past, get the stones and changes everything in present but while they have gone to past to get stones, Thanos comes in with them from the past to the present. Even though they change everything Thanos is also back from past to present and the end war happens, so at the end Iron Man kills Thor by snapping his finger using 5 stones and he dies. Black widow gives her life for soul stone, Captain America retires and goes back to his past finds his love. Overall I think Captain Marvel is the strongest hotest and sexiest super hero"},
