The second act is a love letter to the marvelous first adventure of the Marvel Cinematic Universe that lasted 11 years, full of quotes more or less explicit.

Eleven years and twenty-two films in the making, and the conclusion of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Infinity Saga has come at last. And it came in the form of the greatest comic book movie of all time. The character work is the main focus throughout the first two hours, and it's brilliant. The changes made to characters such as Hulk, Thor, and, of course, Tony, make them more relatable, identifiable, and entertaining. The acting from everyone is also something to marvel at, especially from Robert Downey Jr, who steals the screen every scene he's in. I honestly think RDJ should win an Academy Award for his performance in this. The plot can be confusing at times, but it's so incredible you don't care, plus the explanation of time travel is one of the best I've seen in film. It's also rare to see a film where the plan isn't to save lives, as they've already failed at that, but instead avenge the lives lost. The action, which is mainly focused on in a fantastic third hour, is also amazing, made even better with beautiful visual effects, giving us one of the greatest, if not the greatest, climaxes in all of cinema. And everything in the film is enhanced by Alan Silvestri's beautiful score, which can be touching, funny, or epic to suit the mood. The humor is also perfectly balanced, especially with Thor. The ending is also one of the best I've ever seen. I remember hearing everyone sniffling and crying in the theater when I saw it, it was so heartbreaking, myself included, but those became tears of joy when it became so sweet and happy you couldn't help but fall in love with this film. I've heard people diss Thanos in this, as he doesn't get as much screentime and acts more like a generic baddie than, well, Thanos. And yeah, this did kind of bug me, but I think it works because we got to know him so well in Infinity War, we don't need that much to understand or enjoy him. All in all, Avengers: Endgame is one of the best films ever that I'll surely see many times in the future, and is very worth watching yourself. 13/10"},

Of coarse the special effects and camera shots were crazy awesome but everyone already knows the effects will be great but a great story line going into sequels is difficult . Reguardless of Marvel movies all tying in together somehow this movie could have easily not been as successful but thankfully the writers producers and directors did an awesome job putting it together. Theres a nice balance of humor as well and lots of action alot more than the previous two Spidey films. This movie really shows with great power comes great responsibility . Stay for the two end credit scenes at the end of the movie worth it . The chemistry between Holland and Zendaya is as believable and real in the movie as in real life since they've been dating for a few years now . This movie has a weight to it serious storyline with a along with a deep heartfelt story that goes with it. Any Spidey fan will love this movie I've watched these films since the first was released way back in 2002 . Stan Lee would be proud of this newest film honestly after seeing I'm not at all surprised it's made a billion + dollars now as of Christmas day 2021 worth your time and money go see it you will not be disappointed"},

The answer I think all filmmakers are looking for is Avengers: Endgame. This was a perfect balance (ha) of funny and soul-crushing. It followed our remaining avengers (and rocket and nebula) that were spared the snap in infinity war. The acting, as always, is on point from everyone involved, and let's be honest: we could never predict what was going to happen. I think the biggest curveball thrown at us fans was the scene where Captain America picks up Mjolnir. We all saw him attempt to lift it in Avengers: Age of Ultron, but we never thought they were going to revisit that again. I don't think I blinked or took a breath the whole 3 hours. It felt really short in the end because this movie never dragged. The last thing I wanna talk about is the choices they made with some of the characters. I was very surprised that they made Thor fat, but he wasn't comic relief because of it, which I really liked. He was still badass but had a lot more grief from losing all of his friends from the snap attached to his character. Also, hulk's transformation into Bruce-Hulk is one of the most surprising things. He also got to do the honors of bringing everyone back when they went to the alternate timelines because of: Scott Lang! about him: since he was on house arrest during infinity war and he was stuck in the quantum realm after the snap happened, I'm so glad we got to see him use his idea to essentially, save the universe. And Black Widow: Oh My Gosh, was I sad when she died. I always thought of her as the most complicated character of the Avengers. The Russo brothers did an amazing job of not killing her off too quickly, and, before being sacrificed, she got to have some really solid character development. And finally: Tony Stark. Wow. What a ride it has been for him. Fighting his way out of that cave in Iron Man 1, and now saving the universe and bringing harmony in Avengers: Endgame. Robert Downey Jr. has done a stellar job acting as Tony Stark, and the sendoff was appropriate for a hero that we will always come to respect."},

You know a movie is outstanding when the end credits alone are more epic than the majority of films released in the last 20 years! This film is the pure definition of an emotional roller coaster and throughout it's run time brings about fascination, humor, sadness, incredible excitement, and sheer finality. This is not your typical superhero movie and some viewers used to the entertaining, nonstop action style of the previous films may be disappointed, but I think that this movie brilliantly satisfies and subverts expectations. The film's storytelling is some of the best ever seen in blockbuster filmaking, combining smart writing, intimate character moments, and exceptional world building to create one of the best blockbuster stories ever. The superheroes are all brilliantly acted and well written, with Robert Downey Jr, Scarlett Johannson, and Chris Evans in particular turning in some of the most human and enduring acting preformances I have ever seen. In addition, Josh Brolin once again proves utterly breathtaking as Thanos, and he somehow feels even more intimidating and horribly insane than he was in Infinity War. Further proving that Thanos is definitely among the very best movie villains of the last century. The action is honestly some of the finest in the history of cinema. The world renowned final battle of this film is riveting, heartbreaking, awe inspiring, and exceptionally well choreographed. Never before have I been so thoroughly moved and elated while watching a battle scene in film. The film's soundtrack is also one of the best of it's kind and brilliantly complements the action. It is filled with some of the most stunning, blood-pumping, and epic music themes you will EVER hear. And while the time travel elements (as with all time travel movies) are certainly questionable, as long as you don't spend a week thinking about them they most likely will not bother you. This is my favorite movie of all time (yes I do watch other movies too) and I don't think anything will ever top the experience of watching this movie opening night in the theatre. However, even upon second viewing, the film remains an utter blast to watch with tons of replay value due to the many easter eggs to previous films. Smart, beautiful, epic, and timeless this is a superhero masterpiece!"},

For example;In 2012, Steve said Tony will never sacrifice for others then in endgame he sacrificed for the universe. This show how much tony have change. In the same year, Tony said Everything special about steve rogers came out of the bottles meaning he is just normal human with lab **** tony was **** endgame Captain rogers hold the mjolnir. You need to be humble, brave, courageous, not be selfish and be ready to die for the right cause without hesitation to lift it meaning he is just not a normal human with normal mind set.

A tear-jerking sendoff to Cap, Black Widow, and especially Tony. After all, RDJ IS Tony Stark, and he started this all. The entire cast is incredible in this film. This movie really is fan service, but it really works, as you’re emotionally invested in all of the characters,(which once again really is incredible to think about since there are so many!) Other than that Thanos is also welcome once more. This movie being three hours long may seem a little too long. Actually I didn’t like the pacing of it at first(Infinity War has better pacing), but after nearly a year I can say those three hours are well spent and the pacing does make sense, as you’re given a lot of personal time with the characters. I can’t believe future generations can watch the entire MCU from start to finish. I mean, what an amazing journey it’s been, for viewers and the filmmakers. I absolutely cannot believe how the Russo brothers pulled off two masterpieces, filming back-to-back(insanity). Anyways, I can say that hype for the MCU will definitely die down, and I’m not that interested in the Black Widow movie. Maybe I’ll check it out, but I can say that everything the MCU has been since 2008 has led to this. 4 1/2 out of 5"},

No. Here’s what I liked about endgame and what I didn’t like. Warning: spoilers ahead Liked: The plot. I am an absolute time travel junkie and I thought it was epic seeing the avengers go back in time to the previous movies. The final third act. It starts off with 2014 Thanos bombing the avengers and then we get to see iron man, captain America, and Thor fight off against Thanos and during that fight we get to see captain lift the mjolnir which is one of my favorite scenes of the entire movie. Then all of a sudden when all seems lost. Everybody shows up. No literally, every good guy shows up through portals onto the battleground to fight back against Thanos and it’s just this giant final action scene and it’s my favorite fight in any avengers movie. The final 5 minutes: I loved how in the end young captain stays back in the past to stay with Peggy and old captain gives his shield to Anthony Jackie which just gets me so excited for the falcon and the winter soldier. Disliked: Fat Thor. Considering that this is the last time will see the avengers all together I was really pissed off by the decision of having Hemsworth be fat. Many people I know think that it was a funny decision but I absolutely hated it. Predictable. I liked iron mans sacrifice and it felt earned, but the thing is is that I saw that coming and I did find black widows death a little bit predictable too which made not as emotional as it should have been. Nebula. She had many opportunities to tell the avengers what would happen but she just didn’t do tell them. She should have told them what they would have to do if they reached the destination for the soul stone but she didn’t and Johansson died because of it. The pacing. I will say this movie did have the better plot and better emotions than infinity war, but I can’t really deny that the pacing for infinity war is way better than this films pacing. The first act was really slow and I tried as hard as I could to not fall asleep. And I was just waiting for something cool to happen and it did come in the second and third act. Overall I did really enjoy avengers endgame, I will say it may not be as good as everyone else say it is and their are many marvel movies better than this one but it still is a pretty solid movie. But I mean who’s gonna pick this over the dark knight."},

Some people compare this movie with Justice League, but I've my friends n me who have watched Justice League n our opinion to this is that after watching this movie if we see that before the movie was released captain marvel was released. N according to the MCU captain marvel is the strongest avenger, even stronger than Thor. But at the end of justice league when all the Heros were fighting super man enters n in a few minutes or so he defeats the the villain but in endgame captain marvel too appears at the final battle but does not kill Thanos because she'd killed Thanos then the audience would think that what is the use of bringing all the avengers n guardians of the galaxy together only if she has to kill Thanos. Well that's true that she'd bring Thanos' mighty sanctuary down in a few minutes, which was a great help to the avengers......... So at last i would like to say that this movie is a must watch, watch it with ur family n friends....;);) N ENJOY"},

The last film of the 'Avengers' franchise is remarkable and doesn't disappoint. Watching all our favourite superheroes in one film is just surpassing. Marvel has been working on this grand culmination ever since they released 'Iron Man'. I'm damn sure that all of their hard work and ambition has paid off. The directors, Anthony and Joe Russo, have made sure that it delivers an unforgettable experience. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have come up with a screenplay full of epic and unpredictable moments. The film has a great balance of humour, emotions and action. The biggest strength of the film is the emotions. This is the most emotional superhero film I have ever seen. It's just perfect. The action sequences were jaw-dropping. The climatic battle left me amazed. It's just filled with memorable moments and cannot be described with words. The visuals are gorgeous and have a great impact on the film. The humour doesn't look exaggerated and manages to entertain throughout the film. The plot twists were very impressive and suspenseful. The film features many cameos of characters from the previous MCU films, which just gives a double dose of excitement. The background score gives me goosebumps, though I've listened to it several times. It was really clever to make changes to the characterization of the Hulk. I enjoyed that a lot. But the show-stealer is Robert Downey Jr, who plays the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man. The man who started it all proves yet again that there's no one else who can perfect his role. Do not miss his powerful moments in the final battle."},

A tear-jerking sendoff to Cap, Black Widow, and especially Tony. After all, RDJ IS Tony Stark, and he started this all. The entire cast is incredible in this film. This movie really is fan service, but it really works, as you’re emotionally invested in all of the characters,(which once again really is incredible to think about since there are so many!) Other than that Thanos is also welcome once more. This movie being three hours long may seem a little too long. Actually I didn’t like the pacing of it at first(Infinity War has better pacing), but after nearly a year I can say those three hours are well spent and the pacing does make sense, as you’re given a lot of personal time with the characters. I can’t believe future generations can watch the entire MCU from start to finish. I mean, what an amazing journey it’s been, for viewers and the filmmakers. I absolutely cannot believe how the Russo brothers pulled off two masterpieces, filming back-to-back(insanity). Anyways, I can say that hype for the MCU will definitely die down, and I’m not that interested in the Black Widow movie. Maybe I’ll check it out, but I can say that everything the MCU has been since 2008 has led to this. 4 1/2 out of 5"},

The film does have everything you'd expect from a Marvel film, including a great cast, amazing special effects, shocking moments, incredible action, and of course humor. To the lay person, I supposed it could be considered a perfect film, but to me, a person who has dedicated themselves to Science Fiction, I saw some pretty big plots holes, (I won't discuss them here as I don't give spoilers in my reviews, but we can talk about them at length in the comments section). In order to counteract the actions of Thanos (Josh Brolin) in the previous film, the remaining Avengers need to try all kinds of things, and they try a literal smorgasbord of Science Fiction classics from time travel to alternate universes. While these make for great story telling, there is a format to them and universal rules but this film ignores all of those. I wouldn't say that takes much away from a truly fantastic story, but it's something that bothered me. What I have always loved about the Avengers is the ability to take all these huge stars and larger than live characters and put them into one film, without overdoing it. Everyone has their place and it's always a perfect fit. No one is the star of the film, but no one is ignored either, it's just something that is so rarely done and almost never works out quite this well. As for the nearly three hour running time, the film is so well paced that you don't even notice it. The Bottom Line is that a lot of series try to overdo it for the big finally and end up falling flat (shout out to Game of Thrones). This is not the case with the Avengers as they really did save the best for last."},

The marvel universe led to this one movie, and has brought people together for the final Avengers movie. Endgame is a movie that others should strive to be like. Endgame is the top grossing movie of all time. No other movie has made more money than Endgame . It recently dethroned Avatar, taking its place as first. So many people have seen Endgame , so they must be doing something right. Endgame has a 94% rating on rotten tomatoes, or 4.5 stars. Helen O’Hara from Empire says, “A victory lap that moonwalks through the best part of the MCU back catalogue and emphasises emotion as much as action, this is an intensely satisfying piece of blockbuster filmmaking.” She sums it up pretty well. Everyone I know has seen at least one marvel movie. It would be impressive if you haven’t. Marvel has made countless movies and comics. Everyone knows the iconic series The Avengers. Featuring well known characters such as IronMan, SpiderMan, Captain America, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, and many more. It is a movie that brings together fans of different characters and movies together. The movie itself was amazing. You can have a great idea for a movie, but the execution has to be perfect, and Endgame is not far from it. All the actors played their parts perfectly, and the plot was amazing. It continued from the movie before it, Infinity War. The villain, Thanos, portrays the perfect example of a villain. A good villain has a point, and is hard to see why they are wrong. Thanos is a great example, all he wants to do is help. The special effects looked incredible as ever, as most Marvel movies do. Endgame Is a movie that should set the example for other movies. The film industry if flooded with movies that are incredible, and ones that should learn from others. Of course there are other types of movies, but make sure you have all the elements to a perfect movie. Even if it takes 20 movies before it!"},

Marvel has multiple movies that explain the story of all of their characters in this movie. I also love the way that they used CGI. When you think about it, nothing that happens in the movie is even possible in real life, but with CGI the directors made it look so realistic and everything feels like it is real. It took 22 films to build to this epic conclusion and the payoff is every bit as satisfying as it could and should be.

Marvel truly thought through everything from the smallest details to the moments where you didn't expect it at all. As long as you've watched infinity war, I believe you'll be able to understand a lot of the film without watching all the others. I've only just started watching phase 2 and already enjoying it as well as understanding a lot more references. Infinity War and Endgame is such a good place to start if wanting to get into Marvel.

The last film of the 'Avengers' franchise is remarkable and doesn't disappoint. Watching all our favorite superheroes in one film is just surpassing. Marvel has been working on this grand culmination ever since they released 'Iron Man'. I'm damn sure that all of their hard work and ambition have paid off. The directors, Anthony and Joe Russo have made sure that it delivers an unforgettable experience. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have come up with a screenplay full of epic and unpredictable moments. The film has a great balance of humor, emotions, and action. The biggest strength of the film is the emotions. This is the most emotional superhero film I have ever seen. It's just perfect. The action sequences were jaw-dropping. The climactic battle left me amazed. It's just filled with memorable moments and cannot be described with words. The visuals are gorgeous and have a great impact on the film. The humor doesn't look exaggerated and manages to entertain throughout the film. The plot twists were very impressive and suspenseful. The film features many cameos of characters from the previous MCU films, which just gives a double dose of excitement. The background score gives me goosebumps, though I've listened to it several times. It was really clever to make changes to the characterization of the Hulk. I enjoyed that a lot. But the show-stealer is Robert Downey Jr, who plays the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man. The man who started it all proves yet again that there's no one else who can perfect his role. Do not miss his powerful moments in the final battle."},

After the jaw dropping cliffhanger Avengers Infinity war left us with, I didn't know how the Marvel films could get any better. But they did. We get to see the Avengers save the world one last time. For one last fight. And definitely the most important mission of all. The movie ties together all the past MCU movies in an unexpected way. Not only is the character development of the original six avengers incredible but the acting is perfect. Robert Downey Jr.'s acting brought the film to life and proves how talented he is. Although Thanos is the villain in the films, I can definitely say that Josh Brolin's performance of Thanos was impeccable. Every actor was wonderful and gave dimension to their character. The special effects were believable and there were no flaws as far as I can see. The small details and references to other movies made the film all the better. The movie is in no way cliche and will keep you on your toes the whole time. I have no complaints towards this movie! The Russo Brothers did justice to Stan Lee's comics and stories. They truly showed how these movies are more than just stories. After seeing these amazing characters go on one hell of a journey I think the Russo brothers gave us the best ending we could ever ask for. There are so many lovable moments that made me jump up and scream. I'd hate to spoil anything for first time watchers so i won't go into any details. But I can't get over my love for this film and the others. It has action, humor, and will probably jerk some tears. If you have any hesitations to watch this movie... do your self a favor and WATCH IT! *Watch all the prior MCU movies before watching Endgame*"},

Eleven years and twenty-two films in the making, and the conclusion of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Infinity Saga has come at last. And it came in the form of the greatest comic book movie of all time. The character work is the main focus throughout the first two hours, and it's brilliant. The changes made to characters such as Hulk, Thor, and, of course, Tony, make them more relatable, identifiable, and entertaining. The acting from everyone is also something to marvel at, especially from Robert Downey Jr, who steals the screen every scene he's in. I honestly think RDJ should win an Academy Award for his performance in this. The plot can be confusing at times, but it's so incredible you don't care, plus the explanation of time travel is one of the best I've seen in film. It's also rare to see a film where the plan isn't to save lives, as they've already failed at that, but instead avenge the lives lost. The action, which is mainly focused on in a fantastic third hour, is also amazing, made even better with beautiful visual effects, giving us one of the greatest, if not the greatest, climaxes in all of cinema. And everything in the film is enhanced by Alan Silvestri's beautiful score, which can be touching, funny, or epic to suit the mood. The humor is also perfectly balanced, especially with Thor. The ending is also one of the best I've ever seen. I remember hearing everyone sniffling and crying in the theater when I saw it, it was so heartbreaking, myself included, but those became tears of joy when it became so sweet and happy you couldn't help but fall in love with this film. I've heard people diss Thanos in this, as he doesn't get as much screentime and acts more like a generic baddie than, well, Thanos. And yeah, this did kind of bug me, but I think it works because we got to know him so well in Infinity War, we don't need that much to understand or enjoy him. All in all, Avengers: Endgame is one of the best films ever that I'll surely see many times in the future, and is very worth watching yourself. 13/10"},

The answer I think all filmmakers are looking for is Avengers: Endgame. This was a perfect balance (ha) of funny and soul-crushing. It followed our remaining avengers (and rocket and nebula) that were spared the snap in infinity war. The acting, as always, is on point from everyone involved, and let's be honest: we could never predict what was going to happen. I think the biggest curveball thrown at us fans was the scene where Captain America picks up Mjolnir. We all saw him attempt to lift it in Avengers: Age of Ultron, but we never thought they were going to revisit that again. I don't think I blinked or took a breath the whole 3 hours. It felt really short in the end because this movie never dragged. The last thing I wanna talk about is the choices they made with some of the characters. I was very surprised that they made Thor fat, but he wasn't comic relief because of it, which I really liked. He was still badass but had a lot more grief from losing all of his friends from the snap attached to his character. Also, hulk's transformation into Bruce-Hulk is one of the most surprising things. He also got to do the honors of bringing everyone back when they went to the alternate timelines because of: Scott Lang! about him: since he was on house arrest during infinity war and he was stuck in the quantum realm after the snap happened, I'm so glad we got to see him use his idea to essentially, save the universe. And Black Widow: Oh My Gosh, was I sad when she died. I always thought of her as the most complicated character of the Avengers. The Russo brothers did an amazing job of not killing her off too quickly, and, before being sacrificed, she got to have some really solid character development. And finally: Tony Stark. Wow. What a ride it has been for him. Fighting his way out of that cave in Iron Man 1, and now saving the universe and bringing harmony in Avengers: Endgame. Robert Downey Jr. has done a stellar job acting as Tony Stark, and the sendoff was appropriate for a hero that we will always come to respect. Overall: 11/10."},

As what I didn't like let's be honest there are a lot of plot holes and contrivances with this movie. But I feel that was inevitable as it is a movie about time travel. Also, I'm not a big fan of what they did with Thanos as he felt more like a CGI character than the well fleshed out character he was in Infinity War. But anyways this movie really was a beautiful send-off and really nice love letter to all these beloved characters. The nostalgia I felt and the strong emotions I felt when watching this movie were great. The final fight at the end was some of the best action out of any comic book movie. And the way it ended the two main superheroes Tony Stark and Steve Rogers was very well done. This is a flawed but satisfying conclusion to the MCU."},

'Avengers: Endgame' is all of what I expected/wanted and more. I got goosebumps twice throughout the (masterfully paced) 181 minute run time, I can't say many films have inflicted that on me! Love the ending and the way the Infinity Saga story wraps up. The action is ultra thrilling, the score is fantastic and the effects remain great. I will say I don't think they nail the screen time for all involved outstandingly - that's not a negative, at all, it's just the fact that 'Captain America: Civil War' and 'Avengers: Infinity War' did it to an incredibly higher degree previously. The cast are marvellous, pardon the pun. Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans remain superb and are still the most standout, though you also have the likes of Chris Hemsworth, Josh Brolin, Scarlett Johansson, Bradley Cooper and Mark Ruffalo - love the look of Hulk in this one, btw. I've only become properly aware of all of the MCU in the last two weeks or so, yet this still gave me a memorable experience seeing this main story crescendo like this - I imagine it would've been quite the journey 'live' from ten years or so prior to the release of this. Look forward to continuing with 'Spider-Man: Far From Home' and the end of Phase Three, and then - all things well - beyond."},

It took Marvel over a decade to establish all the characters and set everything up. Infinity War and Endgame are the culmination of over a decade's worth of careful cinematic planning. The sheer scale of it... The nostalgia, too, because we grew up watching these movies. We've been watching these characters on our screens for years. We've seen them grow and develop. I honestly think we will never get a series of interconnected movies like this in our lifetime. Who could even do it? DC tried and it didn't really work out. They were behind and they rushed it. They have a couple of good movies, but not like Marvel. And there's also the superhero fatigue to keep in mind. Maybe Disney could do this with Star Wars. There are also the X-Men movies. But I digress... I've seen the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe multiple times. I love all of the movies. They're very good as a standalone. But they're even better when you take into account the shared universe element. I genuinely believe Avengers: Endgame is peak superhero genre. It's the apex. We will never get a more epic superhero movie than that in our lifetimes. Maybe Marvel will hard-reboot everything in like 50 years, who knows... This has been an incredible journey. And I know Marvel will keep making movies, but I think it can only go downhill from Endgame. I don't believe they can outdo the Infinity Stones and Thanos storyline and everything before that lead to it."},

Standard, 3D, IMAX, or 4D, no matter how you see this movie it will be worth the money, regardless of whether you are a true fan or from the general population. This was further confirmed when all movie tickets were sold out 3 weeks prior to the opening weekend. But let’s talk about the enormity of this film and what Marvel just accomplished. First, this movie did not disappoint. It is very hard to contemplate a movie that will ever have as much or more anticipation than Endgame. Just think about the build up of this film. From May 2008 to April 2019, Marvel, in 21 films, introduced heros, villians, plots, side plots, family members, love interests and countless easter eggs that culminated into this film. Second, in a movie full with 10+ main characters, Marvel did an unbelievable job featuring each one and staying true to the characters we’ve all fallen in love with. This point could easily be a thesis paper for a doctoral candidate. The development and story arcs of characters, individually and collectively, in the midst of struggle and triumph is nothing short of amazing. The attention to detail and thoughtful craftsmanship is true artwork. One knock fans may have is the forced fandom moments. We have so many beloved characters but these moments comes as certain team-up pairings during the big fight that are great but also forced and stereotypical. Lastly, this movie is beauty in motion. Mainly, the movie looks and sounds wonderful. If there is one knock against the movie, the final fight at points was too dark for some of the characters. Otherwise, the final fight displays exactly what many of the DC movies have failed with, Hero power display. Marvel did such a great job of making you feel every punch, kick, hammer throw but also made you feel like you were in motion with each character (thus why I believe 4D would be very good). The sound editing is very good and the song selections in this movie help the viewers follow the emotional rollercoaster ride everyone believes they are in for. Marvel created near perfection for fans (or a near perfect ending). And the ending of this movie, isn’t even technically the finish to Phase 3 of their universe. That would be Spiderman: Homecoming coming soon. Phase 4 and 5 are also already in the works. Everyone that was a part of this movie and the first 3 phases should be applauded, but their work is not yet done because for those with the greatest power comes great responsibility."},

Why not do it while he was still alive? Stan Lee had invested all his energy and love to defend the characters he created, hoping that one day, they could be presented on the big screen. He had spent most of his life trying to achieve this. If he were still alive, Stan Lee would have immediately reacted and shamed those two people. I am not talking about those two marvelous creators but of the individuals they are. One must always distinguish the creations of an artist from the person the creator actually is. One may like Woody Allen movies without having to like the person. In literature, I love Journey to the End of the Night but dislike and resent the pro-fascist, antisemitic author, Louis-Ferdinand Céline. For those not aware of Martin Scorsese and Jennifer Aniston’s comments: Martin Scorsese said: “Marvel movies are not Cinema. Honestly, the closest I can think of them (the MCU films), as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks.” Jennifer Aniston thinks Marvel is ‘ruining cinema.’ In the mid-50s and especially in the early 1960s, rock has burst onto the music scene with singers such as Elvis Presley, Jimi Hendrix, and bands such as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and The Doors, which were soon followed by Santana, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, to name a few. Classical music lovers treated this new musical trend with disdain and contempt and considered it by no means to be music. Shortly after, this so-called \"noise\" pushed aside classical music and invaded the media. Today, again, history is repeating itself. Thanks to special effects, a new genre of films has taken cinemas by storm. In terms of audience and revenue, the MCU surpasses anything that has been done before. If these films are what the public wants to see, is that not all that matters? Martin Scorsese has written, directed, and produced masterpieces - The Departed, Gangs of New York, Casino, GoodFellas, The Aviator, Shutter Island... Jennifer Aniston was a wonderful woman in Marley and Me, Derailed, The Good Girl, and, for 10 years, the lovely Rachel Green, in Friends. In their own particular fashion, both were game-changers. How can a genius such as Martin Scorsese not understand that something new and unexpected like the MCU can be a game-changer? The MCU will keep on attracting viewers until either another technological revolution brings us completely different films, impossible to imagine today, or the MCU will run out of ideas, or viewers will get tired of this kind of movies just as viewers got tired of other genres which have completely disappeared, such as the Western whose audience appears to be drying up... The MCU won’t be on the forefront forever."},

The movie was fun yes, but for a decade of build up and being a sequel to the arguably the best mcu movie of all time, Infinity War, the movie fell short in meeting the expections of what I had in mind. They turned my 2 favourite hero's of Hulk and Thor into characters only there for comedic value. A decade of character development just for them to lose all of that in Endgame really ruined the movie in my opinion. The movie suffered from an extreme imbalance between comedy and seriousness, and for that reason I believe it to be the most underwhelming marvel movie of all time."},

This film is not flawless. It is cool very well done with a cast of high fly. He is Tony Clack's Emblem of Robert Jr. Downey. We even have the right to Disney's vision of their work. My disappointment is in the treatment that Disney always keeps ie \"We hurry to treat the entire environment and we focus on the characters on the screen.\" The strength of a Disney is the licenses so why wasted all the time. The swipe is too quickly explained. The time machine is useless since it is enough to have only the combination. The death of one of the characters for the stone of infinity is really the déjà vu which defuses all emotion before the scene. A Disney movie without real death is a disappointment because no one really dies. It's like hesitation in the life of the day it does not move anything forward. Avengers Endgame est la cloture des 10 derniéres années de suprématie de Disney en terme de super Héros. Ce film n'est pas sans faille. Il est cool trés bien fait avec un casting de haute volé. Il est l'Embléme du Tony Strack de Robert Jr Downey. Nous avons meme le droit à la vision de Disney sur leur oeuvre. Ma deception est dans le traitement que Disney garde toujours c'est a dire \"On se dépéche de traiter tout l'environnement et on se concentre sur les personnage à l'écran\". La force d'un Disney ce sont les licences alors pourquoi se dépéché tout le temps. Le swipe est trop vite expliqué. La machine à remonté dans le temps est inutile vu qu'il suffit d'avoir uniquement la combinaison. La mort d'un des personnage pour la pierre d'infinité est réeellement du déja vu ce qui désamorce tout émotion avant la scéne.

An emotional conflict that sees The Avengers going from broken and forlorn, to reflexive, to strong again and everything in between. The power of seeing these characters go through this journey is the heart and soul of the movie, and is not to be under estimated. The majority of the three hour running time forsakes action to explore the effects Infinity War had on who these heroes have become, and yet it's no less exciting than anything that's come before. Some necessary, if minor improvements have been made that will help the MCU moving forward should Disney and Marvel stand firm in retaining this level of quality in future endeavors. For example, I've complained about subpar CGI in quite a few of these movies that seems to arise from a lack of effort being put in, rather than budgetary constraints. Here though there's not a lackluster visual to be found. I understand they realized the need to pull out all of the stops for this one and therefore phoned nothing in. A mentality that should be applied to every MCU film going forward. Brie Larson also improves in her role as Captain Marvel. She doesn't have much screen time at all, but what few scenes she does have show much more natural her performance is this time around. I'm beginning to retroactively feel that my issues with her acting in the standalone movie were more the result of the directors as opposed to the actress herself. The character of Danvers herself though could probably still use a little tweaking to make her likable though. Endgame also deals with darker content than one would expect from a MCU flick. On top of dealing with themes of hopelessness and regret stemming from how The Avengers defeat led to the deaths of so many, the violence is also quite shocking for a film of this nature. There's a decapitation right at the start of the movie and a perfectly visible slit throat for audiences to gawk at, among other bloody scenes. It's interesting to see stuff like this given the relatively wholesome nature these films have been known for and I'm curious to see what kind of content this opens the MCU on the big-screen up to in the future (they've been doing more graphic stuff like this on the television tie-ins for a while now). A lot of this movie is going to mean nothing to those who haven't followed this journey across the other 20 or so films that came before it. You might still get some entertainment from the humor and spectacle, but will be totally lost on who these people are, what's going on, and miss out on the real impact of Endgame. This is for the fans. For them it's an ending and a new beginning for a world they've been following for years now. With events that radically and forever change the face of cinema's first shared universe. 9.3/10"},

Its got a good handful of stand out moments that were amazing and will become iconic.

Ya por arriba de la euforia que me provocó Endgame podré ser más específico con esta reseña. Cuando hablo con la gente sobre Endgame siempre comienzo diciendo: Los hermanos Russo le tienen mucho cariño y entusiasmo a Marvel y su MCU que es notable la dedicación con la que desenvuelven y cuentan su historia. Desde el cameo de Joe Russo (quien lo ha hecho en las películas de Marvel que dirigió a excepción de Avengers Infinity War), pasando por varias fuertes referencias para los fans de verdad de Marvel y la capacidad de honrar la melancolía del público, hasta el ingenio con el que construyen a los personajes y sus destinos; esta última película de The Infinity Saga demuestra que el cine de acción, de consumo masivo y alto valor capitalista, también puede tener un gran valor artístico. Mientras que la trama de Infinity War se crea un ambiente lleno de tensión, emoción y acción, en Endgame, noté que el objetivo era contrastarlo y, por lo tanto, tenemos un desenlace más sensible, sentimental y dramático. Una forma muy acertada de tratar con ambas entregas. Por lo tanto, aunque menos peleas, tenemos más momentos personales e importantes, para los personajes, que los llevaran a recobrar, uno a uno, su propia inspiración y motivación. Por lo tanto, los actores, principalmente Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans y Scarlett Johansson logran agregar dramática a la película y, junto a varios más, forman un elenco justo. Visualmente es poética y espectacular, especialmente porque se enfoca en construir escenarios enormes y llenos de emoción en donde la luz es caótica, el espacio pacífico, la tierra pesada y todos logran al menos una postura digna de un memorial. La música, por Alan Silvestri, complementa la emoción perfectamente y, en sí, me encantó tanto que podría hablar de Endgame sin cansarme. Me da gusto ver que hay gente que, por más sumergida en la industria comercial, todavía es responsable de su propio arte. Gracias. - Now that I’m over the euphoria that Endgame caused in me, I will be able to be more specific in this review. When I talk with people about Endgame, I always start by saying: The Russo brothers are very fond and enthusiastic to Marvel and it's MCU that it's remarkable the devotion with which they unfold and tell their story. From Joe Russo's cameo (who has done it in the Marvel movies that he has directed, except in Avengers: Infinity War), passing through strong references for true Marvel fans and the capacity to honor the public's melancholy, until the cleverness with which they make their characters and their destinies; this last movie from the Infinity Saga shows that action cinema of massive consumerism and high capitalist value can also have a great artistic value. While the plot of Infinity War creates an environment full of tension, emotion, and action, in Endgame I notice that the objective was to contrast it and, therefore, we have a more sensible, sensitive and dramatic outcome. An accurate way to deal with both deliveries. Thanks to that, the actors, mainly Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, and Scarlett Johansson achieve to add drama to the movie and, along with other actors, they build up a fair cast. Visually it's poetic and spectacular, especially because it focuses on build gigantic sceneries full of emotion in where light is chaotic, space is calm, the ground heavy and everyone achieves, at least, one posture worthy of a memorial. The music, by Alan Silvestri, complements the emotion perfectly and, anyways, I loved it so much that I could talk about Endgame without getting tired. I'm glad to see that there are people that, even though they are deep into the commercial industry, are responsible of their own art. Thanks."},

It felt like separate movies playing out at different times, fitted into one movie. The entire first two hours didn’t really give me any surprises, although I was still entertained at times. However, the final battle in the last third of the movie was incredible and the storyline started to draw me in until the final scene.

As a Marvel fan, I can definitely say that Avengers: Endgame is a love letter to the fans and provides a satisfying emotional conclusion. Before I get started, here is a spoiler warning. Go see Avengers: Endgame and then come back. Let’s get some negatives out of the way. Everything up until the Time Heist drags on and starts to get boring. I know that they need to set everything up for the 2nd and 3rd acts of the film but I wish they had done it better. The 2nd and 3rd acts of this film make up for this though. I also didn’t like the explanation for the their time travel. The film basically states that anything the characters do in the past doesn’t affect the future which makes no sense at all. I know that this is their own rule but it just makes no sense at all. Why would changing the past not affect the future at all. That would mean that Nebula would have disappeared when she killed her past self. The one other problem is that some of the jokes didn’t work. The positives far outweigh the negatives though. The cast does an outstanding job especially all of the main Avengers. I loved watching them together with War Machine, Nebula, and Rocket. All the supporting characters also did an amazing job. The plot can get confusing sometimes but generally, it’s understandable. The tone remains consistent throughout the film. It’s sometimes funny when it needs to be funny and it’s serious when it needs to be serious. The cinematography was fine. It wasn’t anything special. The visual effects for this film are amazing though. The armies look mostly real and Thanos looks great as always. There is a lot of emotional weight to this film which kinda surprised me. I was expecting Hawkeye to die but I was generally surprised and sad when they killed off Black Widow. I was really sad when they killed Iron Man. I knew they were but I didn’t know how they would kill him. It was incredibly satisfying to hear Iron Man say “I am Iron Man” one last time. His death is sad but satisfying. The funeral scene at the end of the film was so awesome and brought back some characters we haven’t seen for a long time. The action in this film is probably the best in the MCU. The climactic battle at the end is in my opinion the best action scene in all of cinema. Captain America wielding Mjolnir was so awesome to watch. Personally, I loved the ending for Captain America. He got to live the life he never lived. Overall, Avengers: Endgame is a satisfying conclusion to the first 22 films in the MCU while boosting a very strong cast, some amazing action, and an immensely satisfying conclusion.

{"movie": "avengers-endgame", "user": "Alinzpark", "score": "7", "date": "JUN 17, 2019", "text": "Avengers Endgame, directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, ends the “Infinity Saga” of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a trail-blazing, wildly unpredictable manner; bringing 22 films of story to a towering, satisfying close. While the quality of MCU films have always spanned from mediocre to excellent, not even the best have managed to break past being “really good for a superhero movies”. Luckily, Endgame finally bucks this trend. The Russos, who also directed last year’s Infinity War deserve all the recognition they can get for successfully putting a cap on 10+ years of character development in a way nobody predicted. The story is so experimental and unconventional, it was a bit unbelievable that it was a Marvel movie at times. Speaking of characters, the direction the movie takes certain heroes is incredibly shocking while never being arbitrary. Some decisions are hilarious, others are heartbreaking, but they all work incredibly well. A surprising highlight of the movie is actually Bruce Banner (aka. The Hulk). The twist that’s put on his character is not only dizzyingly hilarious, but also profoundly meaningful and, as always, the appeal of the character is helped along by a typically charismatic and likeable Mark Ruffalo performance. All performances are good, though, with Robert Downey Jr. in particular giving an incredible performance as Iron Man. With this being the finale of the saga, many actors give incredible performances in their final appearances in the MCU. The film is far from light, though, as the latter half of the film is surprisingly gruelling; climaxing in an emotionally towering climax that is certain to please longtime fans. The film is absolutely not perfect, though, as there is a handful of uncharacteristically hamfisted moments pepper throughout; one scene in particular, which is clearly meant to be empowering, makes little sense and comes off as more pandering than anything. Also, while the film is largely entertaining, the film does feel a bit bloated at times and the surprisingly lengthy first act is incredibly slow moving and somber and is guaranteed to test some audiences’ patience. Overall, though, The MCU has pulled off something pretty amazing. It has ended 22 films of work in a way that is not only satisfying, but surprisingly experimental and groundbreaking. There is undoubtedly problems with endgame, but they are far from crippling and it’s worth marveling at what has been accomplished."},

In particular the humor. The humor in the MCU has gotten horrible and always seems to show up when you would be experiencing something other than laughter (\"I aimed for the head\"). This is the primary reason I don't consider these movies to have any heart put behind them. I firmly believe that they follow a formula where there has to be a joke after a certain amount of time regardless if it kills the mood. On the bright side, at least Thanos' goal made sense in this movie. The killing half the universe thing is stupid if you still allow what is left to reproduce, and since he had the kill set to randomize you were always going to have about a 50/50 split on the sexes. Thor, just why? He has been a pointless laughing stock since Ragnarok. Hulk was also a disappointment. If the comics are anything to go by, people in general don't like a fusion of Banner and Hulk, and generally it seemed it only existed due to the special limitation that they put into the Infinity Guantlet (which shouldn't have limitations and makes no sense to have any if Thanos was going to do with it in this movie what he wanted). If it wasn't for Downey and Thanos this time I would probably rate this movie a zero."},

If they want to go time Travel to get the stones and if Banner told them If he change something in the past won’t change the future, then why didn’t they get the stones when Thor injury Thanos in Wakanda battle and all the characters just take the gauntlet with the stones and bring to the Future.

{"movie": "avengers-endgame", "user": "rodsager", "score": "10", "date": "JUN 11, 2019", "text": "This review is an edited for size, repost from one of my blogs on wordpress. ****/2019/04/26/what-a-finale/ Avengers: Endgame was nothing short of brilliant; it is a masterpiece in the genre of super hero films and is good enough to transcend the action movie sphere. There were a great many reviews suggesting the movie was long. But was it? Making reference to its length tends to lead the reader to believe that it dragged on. This film does not drag on, not at all. Never once during the entire 181 minutes, yes friends that is a minute beyond the three-hour mark, did I get that feeling of \"this is a long movie.\" Not one time. Is it a long movie? No, no it is not. It is a three-hour movie that blows by like a two-hour movie. I still can't wrap my head around everything they were able to convey without losing the audience and without overwhelming it either. I have to say that the scene stealing in this movie is from an unlikely character. The Hulk literally steals the show. Thor is amazing as well but he is not what you expect this go 'round. I will have to view it again to really soak it all in but I will say it was not a perfect film if there ever is such a thing. Hollywood loves to do stupid stuff and Endgame is no exception. Tony shows up in an Audi E-Tron which is an all-electric vehicle and it is like other electric vehicles, silent. The director decided to have a roaring engine noise dubbed over for \"effect.\" But Audi's E-Tron badge is enormous and in no way subtle, so it is just STUPID to have it roaring in like that! There, that's my complaint ;) It is hard to compare Endgame to movies in the past as I have the advantage of having seen those films before versus when I walked out of the theater after seeing Ironman in 2008, there was no Avengers to compare it to. I was comparing it to the movies that had come before it. Ironman was the first of the 22 films in the Avengers MCU Saga. Part of how these movies rank in my view is how I felt about the film after first seeing it. But also it is about how I feel about it later on, even years later. I still love Tim Burton's 1989 Batman, THIRTY YEARS LATER! That is why that film still rates so high on my chart. This movie however is tough to gauge because it is not a stand alone story. It stands on the shoulders of 21 films that came before it. It is also in effect, a \"Part II\" of the Avengers Infinity War. I feel like a major shakeup is coming on how I view these films and the impact they have. There are better films than this one if we separate the films from their companion films and look only at its stand alone value. Part of what makes this movie so good is the reference we have from the previous 21 films. When we look at the film as part of the totality of effort across all the associated and supporting content, Endgame is absolutely, Top Tier. All by itself however, not as much. But therein lies the reality, it does get the benefit of those prior movies. I still feel that Guardians of the Galaxy flows better and is more \"fun.\" But this movie isn't supposed to be fun, is it? Yet in spite of the gloomy atmosphere that is the post Thanos Infinity Stone apocalypse, this movie is in fact fun. The movie will pay homage to the 21 MCU films that preceded it with a variety of scenes scattered throughout. It is rare to see an action oriented film that can produce moist eyes from tears of both joy and sadness as well as laughs like it is a good stand up routine. The movie weaves the plots of previous films into this film using what is likely some cutting room footage and it all manages to tie together nicely. Although there are a few hopelessly predictable scenes and outcomes, there are some genuine twists in how the Avengers manage to try and \"undo\" what Thanos had done. During the process of \"fixing\" things, Marvel manages to create some amazing scenes that are homages to the past, the way past in fact. This movie feels like an end, it really does. Yes, I know there is a Spiderman movie this summer and there will be a Guardians of the Galaxy III and a whole \"Phase 4\" of MCU, but it is a bit of an end. This film genuinely wraps up the whole MCU into a delicious burrito, dripping with cheese, and soaked in spicy sauce. And we the audience, just ate it all up. In the immortal words of Porky Pig... \"Th-Th-The, Th-Th-The, Th-Th... That's all, folks.\" There were no special scenes during or after the credits roll. There will never be another original \"Stan Lee\" cameo. There is an almost foreboding finality to it. This really brings to close what may someday go down as the greatest series of motion pictures ever made. 22 films over 11 years all collectively formed into one epic saga the likes of which we have never seen before. It is quite possible, we will never see anything like this again. WOW what a ride! Thank you Stan Lee, may your stories and characters remain forever entwined in our hearts and culture."},

The film does have everything you'd expect from a Marvel film, including a great cast, amazing special effects, shocking moments, incredible action, and of course humor. To the lay person, I supposed it could be considered a perfect film, but to me, a person who has dedicated themselves to Science Fiction, I saw some pretty big plots holes, (I won't discuss them here as I don't give spoilers in my reviews, but we can talk about them at length in the comments section). In order to counteract the actions of Thanos (Josh Brolin) in the previous film, the remaining Avengers need to try all kinds of things, and they try a literal smorgasbord of Science Fiction classics from time travel to alternate universes. While these make for great story telling, there is a format to them and universal rules but this film ignores all of those. I wouldn't say that takes much away from a truly fantastic story, but it's something that bothered me. What I have always loved about the Avengers is the ability to take all these huge stars and larger than live characters and put them into one film, without overdoing it. Everyone has their place and it's always a perfect fit. No one is the star of the film, but no one is ignored either, it's just something that is so rarely done and almost never works out quite this well. As for the nearly three hour running time, the film is so well paced that you don't even notice it. The Bottom Line is that a lot of series try to overdo it for the big finally and end up falling flat (shout out to Game of Thrones).

Then, The Avengers discover a very risky posibility for bringing everybody back, but our heroes will try it \"Whatever it takes\". Followed by this discovery, Marvel transports us towards a ride through several of the events that ocurred in its cinematographic universe to gather again the infinity gems paying tribute to more than 10 years of films. After this trip that brings with it a very hight cost, we find ourselves with a spectacular and emotive third act full of an overwhelming fan-service that will never be forgotten by its fans, closing masterfully and uniquely the Infinity Saga. The movie came with very high expectations and managed not only to accomplish all of them, but to avercome more than enough them, and Marvel gives fans everything they have dreamed about. The only thing against this film is that it can never be equealed or overcome, locating it on the cusp of Marvel's cinematographic world and leaving too many hight expectations for later films that, even though, we know we'll love them as they always make us do."},

Where's the oversight?! Disney/Marvel and the rest don't care or know how to make good movies anymore. They're bean counters on an auto pilot conveyor belt. There's no restraint whatsoever regarding plausibility. As absurd as the original grouping of superheroes is (but fun and true to the source, not invalid), they go and pile on every Marvel property including large groupings not even part of The Avengers into a smorgasbord of so many freaking characters slapped together in an endless stupid stream of one liners as excuse for story the result is incoherent plotting (despite its infantile simplicity) and really no emotional investment in any of the characters at all.

I am not sure which Avengers movie, 2 or this one, I would choose as the top movie from the Marvel cinematic universe but it definitely is one of the best ones, one of the 2 top ones. First my main gripe, combined with an admirable effort: The writers use Bruce Banner to establish the axiom of how a Consistency Paradox cannot be occuring. And I am glad that they did that. You cannot overwrite something. You cannot destroy the existence of something by overwriting its state and thus also not overwrite the event that served as initiation of the overwrite itself. That was perfect. What was not perfect? Well, first of all, they used Multiverse Theory. That is bad, because it is also inconsistent but whatever - let's accept that, it fits the comics overall and is at least no Consistency Paradox. BUT the story tries to establish \"if we bring the stones back we dry out those time branches\" - what? No. Either they exist or they don't. Trying to \"dry them out\" would mean you would actually depend on the Overwrite Consistency Paradox which the writers so skillfully already cancelled out. Now IF they establish \"the stones were always brought back, we do not overwrite a timeline/delete it, we simply are talking about something that is possibly but never comes into existence\" then okay, then it would mean that within a timeloop they always brought back the stones after getting them. But they very well established that they want to get rid of the timelines so they were no talking about timelines that never existed in the first place. A timeline without a Thanos because Past Thanos travelled to the other branch will always exist. A timeline where Loki stole the Tesseract and fled will always exist and there is nothing they can do about it by bringing back the stones. At best they \"always brought back the stones\" and that's it. The timelines that we know definitely exist even if there might have never been a timeline \"without Infinity Stones\". Now this being said, I am glad that they at least tried and of course its fine that they at least tried to make an effort caring about causality but treating it like there are no other timelines now is just nonsense because from a chronological perspective and the establishment \"we cannot overwrite/delete things\" they very clearly (and realistically) could not do anything about that. The timeloop by the way was also sloppy because Cap cannot bring back the stones in their original state so he definitly \"has not always brought them back to his own timeline\". I do not know if they forgot about that but I can turn a blind eye on that because they really tried other than other movies and Tony's fate was heartbreaking but he got a solid sendoff, so did Captain America. It is great how the movie ended with him giving him \"a second chance\", but I think the writers wanted us to just think about the joyful side of this because the reality is: Even that was another timeline. Captain America had a life with an Alterative Magaret. His own Margaret still became an old, lonely lady in his \"home timeline\" and that is pretty sad and depressing for both. Well, nevertheless for what the movie tried, establishing good character scenes with all kinds of emotions, wrapping up things (even if not completely correct but the effort was here) and offering spectacular finale to this story arc it did a absolutey fantastic job. By the way - there was no solid reason why they could not snap their own set of Stones back into existence. On top of that: i understand why they cannot bring back Gamora and Natasha as they ARE the Soul Stone but Vision existed together with the Mind Stone and Thanos already proved the Stone together with Vision can be brought back so they should have brought him back. I love it times 3000. By the way - half of the time travelling complaints here on this site come from ordinary pop-culture fanboys that have no idea of time phenomena, causality, et cetera. Just as the other half is from Thanos fanboys that really thought Thanos was a hero in Infinity War just because he \"wanted something good for 50%\" completely dismissing the psychopathic part of the character."},

But I still think that Infinity wars is a better and no Marvel or other superhero movies could reach that level. Infinity wars has an interesting plot to the movie when at the end of the movie characters feel lost and **** by the love ones who are taken away from them. Endgame teaches you grief and how to move on and in my opinion that theme was used too much in the movie and was very overwhelming, but during this movie you can see the affect on the characters but not the other 50% of the Universe's population who are still alive. How bad is Thanos's snap? Is Earth's 50% population struggling from this incident? How are they holding up throughout this situation? How did the Thanos snap affect other countries politically? this is one of my complaints about the movie even though it's not that major. Another complaint that I have was during the end battle you see every hero come together and take on Thanos and his army, but Hulk was left out of this and we don't see him until Tony's funeral. I would've loved to see Hulk get back into the action even if it's only 5 seconds of him just smashing and throwing the villains like it's nothing. The only scene where Hulk does fight was when they went back in time and Bruce sees his 2012 self fighting the Chitauris during the first Avengers movie. And that's all I have to say about the movie I think that the movie is very decent and I can't wait to see the affects that everyone goes through without Tony Stark in the World."},

I was really hoping to pull off one last one.” After the shocking cliffhanger at the end of ‘Infinity War’, the question that ran through our head’s was “hmm...what just happened?”. Heroes disintegrating out of existence before our very eyes with the last remaining soak up the reality of their failure, and the antagonist finally at peace knowing the monstrous deed is done. ‘Avengers: Endgame’ perfectly wraps up 22 movies in a grand and spectacular scale. For a movie that’s three hours long, not once did I feel the length as everything flew by (in my opinion). There's so much going on. The fact this movie even exist and payed off as well as it did, it’s nothing short of a miracle. The Russo Brothers always do a fantastic job directing action and camera work, but little do people mention how they get the best performance out of everyone and really flesh out each character, and I mean every character. I think Black Widow is best handled whenever the Russo’s are involved, in terms of making her dynamic and characterization rather than hard as nails “girl power” trope - that no other director haven’t got the hint yet. I’m also thrilled Hawkeye gets his time to shine, which helps Jeremy Renner work with material to deliver an emotional performance that was pretty hard hitting at times. Same thing with Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-man. It’s incredibly transparent that the Russo Brothers really like this character and doesn't dumb him down to make other characters look good and isn’t just a buffoon. They understand his intelligent and used Scott’s comedic backbone to his advantage. He basically saves the world (besides the rat). Heck, every character gets a great arc, and yes even Thor, which I don’t understand why people argue that he doesn’t. While still having a comedic charm from ‘Thor: Ragnarok’, but when the scene calls for him to be serious, then expect chaos. He really is the strongest and most tragic Avenger. The other main characters also get fantastic and satisfying arcs. Also the acting from everyone was absolutely stellar. Robert Downey Jr. is magnificent as usual, although here it hits home. Chris Evans really grew into the role of Captain America and I can't imagine any other actor playing the part than him. Karen Gillan is often overlooked playing Nebula, as I always thought she nails every role she plays. Despite the heavy make-up, she still can express so much. What's more to say about these actors than best casting ever. The mad titan himself makes a return, but doesn’t have much screen time than “Infinity War” and...well, let’s just say the character goes into an unexpected direction, to say the last. Still a poetic and intimidating villain that can brawl with the avengers with or without the gauntlet. Josh Brolin once again delivers an excellent performance. Thanos is this generation’s Darth Vader. The action sequences are light years more monumental than ‘Infinity War’. If I have to be honest, I shed a tear at the one point towards the final battle. Although the movie isn’t action heavy throughout, but I was never bored during the more slow paced moments. The score from Alan Silvestri﻿ is perhaps the best and most memorable score in the MCU. A mixture of sadness and loss with a booming blast of epic. Perfectly pays tribute to the original six heroes. Now people have complained about the movie having too much fan service, which I personally didn’t mind and couldn’t see the faults, because then again, this entire cinematic universe belongs to them, the fans. The reason why we have 22 movies, 48 hours and 11 minutes worth of movies and this movie pulling in a monster $2 billion worldwide only in 11 days beating ‘Avatar’ that did so in 47 days! While not a stand alone movie, although considering it’s a follow up to the events of “Infinity War”, it would be tricky to do so. For problems: The story had issues throughout and the entire time travel subplot made no sense whatsoever when given a second thought, but then again, how can you make sense of time travel. I didn’t find Captain Marvel solo movie to be all that interesting - both the movie and her as a character, but was hoping the Russo Brothers would resolve that issue and make the character less wooden. Unfortunately even the Russo’s couldn’t save her. Luckily her screen time is incredibly slim, but they literally pulled a Poochie type of excuse when she was absent for a huge amount of the movie’s run time with a “I must go now. My planet needs me”, from ‘The Simpsons’. I must admit, when she did return, I groaned. Overall rating: Despite the problems, ‘Endgame’ still delivers a sweeping epic that leaves the audience feeling whiplash with emotions. Happiness, sadness, joy and excitement. An experience I’ll remember forever."},

After 10 years and 22 movies, MCU brings an end to an era of the Avengers. And it's no surprise that they couldn't please everyone. That's just too tall of a task for any group of artists. But the brilliant team at Marvel and Disney did one heck of a job making a movie that they can be proud of and did in fact accomplish nearly all of their goals. They wrapped up many story and character arcs. They created the options for continuing stories. They finished off the central conflict with a villain that could honestly be called super. And they paid homage to a line of movies and comic books that have given joy to a generations of fans while showing us that the creators of MCU are all fans too. There are of course plot holes and unanswered questions. How could there not be in a story involving hundreds of characters and dozens of interweaving stories? The wonderful thing is that Marvel and Disney had the courage to see it through. Given there was a time that making serious live action movies about comic books was laughed at in Hollywood. That people would never have attempted telling stories that played out over a decade and 22 movies. These film makers not only pulled it off, they proved that it could be done for a much larger audience than any filmmaker had ever dreamed possible. I for one have cherished every minute of every film. Plot holes, problematic characters and all. And I'm glad to have been around to see my comic book heroes recognized by the world.

For most movies I just wait until they come out on disk (preferably Ultra HD Blu-ray if it’s available) and watch them on my home theater rig. So this weekend me and the kids went to the theater to watch Avengers: Endgame. I have to say that it was better, even much better, than I feared. I really feared that the SJW **** at Marvel would take this opportunity to completely re-organize the Marvel universe to their liking. Like how they completely ruined both professor Xavier and Wolverine in that abysmal Logan movie. Luckily, this did not really happen. Maybe the financial reality of their failing SJW comics and Disney doing a bit of culling of the most extreme of the Marvel ****, the ones who fail to understand that super hero movies are meant to entertain and not be their personal agenda channel, are starting to take effect. It was actually a quite good movie with plenty of action, some humor and, of course, lots and lots of special effects. Even the story made somewhat sense, at least in the context of a Marvel movie, even though the writers resorted to time travel. The movie starts of somewhat dark and grim but I guess that was to be suspected. It cheered up as it moved along and then ending … well to me at least it was mostly satisfactory. I was not too thrilled about the “new” Hulk although I warmed up to him a bit during the film. Thor? The less that is said about him the better actually. The rest of the merry bunch was in pretty good shape and I am quite happy that we did not get to see to much of Quill’s usual shenanigans. I really hate that character. I was quite positively surprised at the huge and quite cool battle towards the end. I was thinking, or rather hoping, that at some time they were just going to reverse Thanos’ crap and that would be it but instead we get to watch another huge confrontation with pretty much everyone involved at the end. Very cool action and FX indeed. There were some silly plot holes of course. As always when writers resort to time travel. An obvious one would of course be that, when they knew they only had enough Pym particles to complete one trip for each person why did they just not go back in time to get more the first thing they did? Especially since they later did exactly that. Also, Captain Marvel (in her new SJW hairdo) flies through a barrage of fire, smashes through Thanos’ ship like it was nothing and then struggles to combat Thanos himself? There were a bit of this silliness spread around but not too much for me to be bothered by it. There were a few casualties of which I am saddened by two of them. I think at least one of them was unnecessary and probably agenda based. I also strongly disliked the rubbish with Captain America at the end. He has never been one of my favorite characters so I do not really care much about him being around or not but that rubbish sob-scene where he hands over his shield to a “politically correct” person was really unnecessary. I guess it must have been put there to appease the Marvel SJW ****. Anyway, my bottom line is that I was greatly entertained by this movie. It had all the good stuff, real super heroes, action, special effects and not too much of the crap that has been spewing out of Marvel the last years."},

In other words, they went for the head; all we cared about are the stones. They also proved that they understand every character in this universe better than anyone. They delved into their minds and hearts in a way fans ever hoped and fancied. They truly fleshed out our beloved avengers by showing them as more humans exactly as we felt about them at every important moment in every movie in the MCU. They convinced us that these characters really experienced these moments, and thus cared about them as much as we do. The incredible cast, who are at the top of their game, couldn't have complemented what the Russos did for their characters more perfectly. Whilst the unique storytelling of Infinity War never feels \"cinematic\", I absolutely loved it with its epic quality and how I felt that I was flipping pages **** novel instead of watching a movie. The Russos used once again the same exceptional style of narration here, except that, to my surprise, it feels as \"cinematic\" as it gets! I have absolutely no clue how they have managed to do such a thing, but what I know is that this made me realize that Infinity War is flawed, especially in this aspect, way more than I thought. Everything here works twice as good as it did in Infinity War ــــ comedy and drama. Also, this made the fast pacing don't come at the expense of the cohesiveness of the story. The movie did make it a bit easy for itself sometimes (and we can see that in certain decisions that some character took, and a couple of things that are quite perfunctory that they could have gone deeper with), but the movie also took three thousand risks that entangled itself in what could have an endless loop of nonsensical chaos only to serve the franchise's fans, and it did as good as it gets.

What I really enjoyed about this movie is that it really took its time with the plot, Sometimes it took too long to get going especially with a 3 hour run time but it was never boring and you just kept getting intrigued with the story elements. When the movie starts it’s right off Infinity War and did really well to establish the consequences of the last movie and to let the characters experience the fallout of Infinity War. As I said the movie really took its time with it plot sometimes it just felt a little too dragged on as it left the directors wanted to over-establish some plot points instead of just keeping it simple but I wouldn’t say it’s a major issue it’s just that in a 3 hour runtime you don’t need to over complicate the plot. However though the story was really fantastic, if I haven’t said it before the Russo Brothers are geniuses they managed to wrap up 10 years worth of storytelling in one movie brilliantly from the First IronMan movie till now. Speaking of characters, obliviously there were a lot characters like Infinity War but Endgame was really about the conclusion of the original six Avengers from IronMan, Black Widow, Captain America, Hulk, Hawkeye and Thor. Each one had an arc and came to satisfying conclusions by the end of the movie. The really surprising performance came from Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye or Ronin who we didn’t see on Infinity War and had a really nice story that involved him and his family and the events of Infinity War and how it impacted him. Robert Downey Jr gave the best performance as usual .In all honesty no one gave a bad performance in this movie they all did really well so that’s another plus. Thanos played by Josh Brolin who had a very big role in Infinity War and was a fantastic villain and was one of the best if not the best thing about Infinity War played a small role in Endgame, I mean he was still Thanos he was badass, menacing and obviously had some memorable lines. He wasn’t in the movie all that much except for in the beginning and largely shows up at the end of the movie for the final showdown and that was kinda disappointing, but with the story the Russos went for you could understand why he wasn’t in it that much but still it was kind of disappointing. Thanos was still a great villain in Endgame all that being said and you could fell The after effects he imposed after Infinity War. Without saying too much Thor and Hulk were the twist characters in this movie I mean they did some surprising stuff with them at first I was like Marvel what did you do but in the case of Hulk it turned out all right but Thor...lets just say I didn’t like what they did to him or his arc(if that’s what you wanna call it) was disappointing. The humor was good for the most part of course this is a Marvel movie so forced humor played a factor(sorry if you keep seeing this in all my Marvel review but it is what it is) especially in the case of Thor I mean Endgame didn’t ruin the character of Thor but it’s like they were trying to ruin him if that makes sense. There wasn’t really a lot of action in the first and second half of the movie maybe one action scene in the second act to keep things fast paced, in fact there were like 2 or 3 action scenes in the whole movie(I’ll talk about the final battle just hold on). I mean that was really surprising that a superhero movie managed to keep me intrigued for that much with so little action so again hats off to the Russo’s for a compelling and interesting story. Now let’s talk about the final battle, yes it was Epic I usually don’t describe anything as Epic but the final battle of Endgame was truly a spectacle and I’m glad I got to see it. It was filled with tense moments, awesome comic book action, drama and truly some wonderful surprises, it had it all that I think the final battle was the best action set piece in all of Superhero movie history just truly phenomenal action. The tone of this movie was lighter than I expected after the events of Infinity War I mean it’s not a bad thing, when the movie got dark and serious you felt it. Endgame was part adventure so I guess you’d expect some lighter tones in some aspect. The third act was really the best part of the whole movie and I mean the whole last act, there were some nail biting moments, epic action and wonderful storytelling and heart breaking scenes. So Avengers: Endgame was a really great movie, had awesome characters, an intriguing story, it was fun, had funny humor, fantastic action, really heartbreaking moments and a satisfying conclusion.Sure there were a few things a didn’t like for instance some baffling character decisions or some dragged on scenes but for the most part all I have to say in a nutshell I Thank You Marvel."},

Without spoiling anything since we know the heros win (Spiderman: Far From Home)- The largest plot hole is what happens to all the people that moved on with their lives? That ending cannot possibly be considered a good solution. What about children that had no parents for all that time? Now add in all the degredation to the world that the Russo's clearly show. Then factor in that many of these people do not have homes, or bank accounts, or jobs. The end result is slightly better than the start of the movie, but not by much. Now the returned have to try to reinegrate... somehow. But hey, CGI!"},

But, was it really so perfectly great? No. . . Good : The first thing I loved about this movie was that it was the most character driven film in the MCU till date. In particular, Hawkeye and Black Widow got the most of character shine. And, it didn't have much of Captain Marvel. As someone who feels awkward when she comes on screen, it was a good thing. It did a great job of serving the fans. So many crowd pleasing moments! I was literally jumping and whistling when I was watching this film, literally. The third act is full of those moments. Those moments do come along with really good character background, a story and excitement. All of these do not make complete sense, but at least they weren't blant. And, many parts are quite nostalgic. It has tried its best to give every character a proper arc. Performances are incredible. I didn't even hate Don Cheadle in this movie. On the whole, it was insanely entertaining and has ridiculous amount of great moments to say the least. . . Mixed : It's not a spoiler to say it's a time travel film. While this plot device served a lot to give us a lot of crowd pleasing moments, each of which I really loved, the whole time travel part could've been even more epic and exciting than it was. There were parts in Infinity War where it jumped from plotline to plotline. This one does the same, but it looked more choppy here. Not necessarily a bad thing, a movie of this scale would have such problems. But it was a bit more distracting than before. I admit I liked many arcs given to the characters. But, they were still a bit illogical, in particular that of Steve Rogers. Many things were entertaining as hell, but still quite paradoxical. . . Bad : It's a time travel movie. It generates a lot many plot holes and inconsistencies. It uses time travel as an excuse for getting certain things done. It has the most generic issues of a non sci-fi time travel movie. The timeline surely is f**ked up now. I don't know how the time travel in this universe works and how certain things were amended due to all of these time travelling stuffs. May be I will never know. And Thanos. He was treated more like a mustache twirling villain, rather than how he was in Infinity War. The way his character ended was the most disappointing part of the movie. It feels as if it tries to be as big as Infinity War while it clearly isn't. . . Conclusion : You can and must watch this film. It's a film by the Russo Brothers, you can definitely count on them for an entertaining film, but this is perhaps their weakest film in the MCU. It isn't well paced as Infinity War is, but still gives all the moments you can wish for. Infinity War is a whole lot better than this film, but is still a worth watching flick. If you stop thinking about the inconsistencies time travel creates in this film, this will be a much better experience. . . Rating. . . Score : 8.9/10 Grade : A"},

It's just a big teaser/commercial for upcoming \"products\" by the Disney;Marvel brand. Final verdict: I'm done with the MCU. The Good: -Moments, plenty of memorable moments, plenty of funny moments. It almost feels like the script had the sole challenge of gluing as many cool moments together while marginally providing a way out of the dead end they wrote themselves into with Infinity War's ending. -RDJ delivers a solid performance, without which I think this movie would be unwatchable. -As per usual, visual effects are great, especially with characters that rely heavily on motion capture, and the de-aging tech is becoming scarily good. -In spite of my harsh criticism of this movie's direction (that is still to come), I still think the Russos deserve praise for taking on the monumental task of handling a comic cross-over event. The Bad: -Writing: Bad writing: bad storytelling, bad character arcs, SJW crap breaking the immersion every few minutes, bad dialogue, lazy jokes and a time-traveling plot that doesn't make any sense. And mother of God, plot convenience is the one true hero of this movie. Scott Lang is saved from being trapped in the Quantum realm by plot convenience mouse, Stark figures out time travel by plot convenience AI, Thanos finds out about the avengers' plan by plot convenience cross-time Nebula, and many many other examples. As for SJW crap, Thor and Hulk has been neutered, and Captain Marvel were shoved in this movie without any vision or purpose. -Direction: The direction was weak; The five year gap in the beginning screws up the pacing and is in my opinion a symbol of the triumph of corporate vision over artistic vision. Since there is no discernible effect of the this 5 year gap on the plot, or even most of the story threads. I can only guess this 5 year gap is a corporate device to house spin-off shows and things of this sort. Something we'll just have to wait and see. The pacing of the movie is terrible all throughout. But specifically, the impact of the heist part is totally undercut by the \"past Nebula revealing the plan to Thanos\" crap, this crap was there only to produce the mandatory final showdown, which wasn't very inspired but had some \"cool\" moments, the plot ends about 15 minutes before the end of the movie which is always a problem. In Infinity War, the directors did a good job of juggling the many characters, but in Endgame, not at all. A good example would be that the only thing BP did in this movie was be on screen for a few seconds and say: \"Yibambe\"! Add to that the clear SJW motif of neutering Hulk and Thor, and you get a 3 hour movie that neither develops, nor even build upon the development from past movies, of most key characters."},

Dr Stranger things and many more with fault of not their own were part of the final movie in one of the most successful and entertaining spectacles of the past decade. The movie itself was a huge collection of familiar faces and scenes, from all major events in MCU, lacking cohesive structure which distorted flow of the movie. The spectacle was too long and action sequences were unevenly spaced which created over too long moments that were more about homage to the last decade of superhero bonanza and tremendous logistic achievement. After all getting all of the cameo actors from the last movies and inserting them into this plot must have been very difficult. Did they suceed ? No, they did not. The effort was admirable and gave us some really touching moments but resulted in unnecessary extending already too long movie. This was confusing the main story plot too much. There were just too much of it. Movie did not offer viewer any spectacular skirmishes in a first two hours. Thats what made IW so special. Endgage was lacking these impactful moments. It is clear that the best was saved for last but this only validates that movie did not have to be so long. If a movie would be filled with IW level of awesome than yeah, bring it on but the problem is that it was stretched too thin and these moments are just not there, not in the beginning anyway. PG-12 rating is a culprit here. If movie's rating was higher I am sure that scenes filled with nothing would be at least more electryfying but because this is a movie aimed at future and former fans, the lighter representation of after apocalypse universe was the only thing Disney corporate machine could have come up with and still get away with achieving PG-12 rating. Younger audience and older audience looked bored in the cinema though. The balance was not achieved here. The final stand off was amazing though and I will say that it is worth the price of admission. When I will be rematching Endgame on blue ray I think I will just skip to the last few chapters just to experience all this wonderfully done explosions and amazingly done fights. It was just epic and the team definitely raised the bar here. Overall the movie was ok but it did not top IW for me. This one will still be the best Avenger movie."},

It’s deeply satisfying and very entertaining in a lot of ways. The themes of depression and loss are handled very well, and they allow the heroes to feel the most human they’ve felt in a long time. As the conclusion to the twenty two movie and eleven year long ‘Infinity Saga’, it’s pretty much perfect. As a stand alone movie (connection to other Marvel movies aside), it’s good, not great. While there are some glaring plot holes that do ruin a few aspects of the movie, I can forgive most of them. The pros out way the cons here, but the cons are definitely there. I had such a good time watching the movie that I didn’t even notice most of the plot holes (not to say there are a lot) on my first or second viewing, they were pointed out to me in other reviews. Here’s the bottom line, it’s very enjoyable to watch, but the second you apply any kind of logic (including rules they established in this movie) to a lot of the plot points, it begins to crumble, but, it gives some characters satisfying endings and others a bright future. I once said that after ‘Spider-Man: Far From Home’, I would stop watching most Marvel movies, but after this, I think I’ll stick around for a little while.

In 3 hours of plot, character, incredible action, mind blowing CGI and real emotional scenes, Avengers: Endgame does not cease to stride above the rest of the MCU. A film that brings viewers back in time and allows the viewers to think about how much the MCU has given us. Very contemplative storytelling is blended with great humour and mythic battle sequences to create Endgame! After (I think) Infinity War failed at managing film with lots of characters, Endgame does not. The characters each are represented with a realistic perspective. Their weaknesses are shown to the viewers. And finally the stars are allowed to act. Hollywood’s most famous actors step it up in Endgame and deliver heartfelt emotional scenes and moments without anything tying them down. The best part for me was how Endgame felt like reading a comic book, the action, the plot, the characters. Even some sequences felt like they were drawn by Stan Lee. But as with any film Endgame has problems but minor problems. First, Thanos could have been defeated much quicker. Some characters were glazed over and forgotten about. Finally, the Avengers could have made better choices. There were ways, easy ways, they could have accomplished their tasks. Some of the things they did were stupid. All of these are minor problems. Avengers: Endgame is by far my favourite Avengers film."},

Out of the 50% of everything that Thanos destroyed in the previous film, Ant-man is the only one to return in the beginning, because of some time travel quantum physics thing that is poorly explained, in which Iron Man discovers how to create time travel and isn't explained how, whatsoever. He just magically creates it in his home with Pepper Pots. Then there's the fact that Thor is a laughable and pathetic, depressed drunk who makes no contribution at all, and Banner Hulk is just awful. Go into this film expecting a lot of boring nothingness for the first 90 minutes and you will find it maybe enjoyable. Now the reason I give it a solid 7 after all this complaining, is that the final act of the movie is very engaging and enjoyable at least.

It was a nice conclusion to the series, it checked off all the boxes, all the Marvel franchise characters got their moment, even though some were featured more than others, and it had a bittersweet and poignant ending Was it great? No, for me it was just very good. There weren't any really suspenseful moments where I was thinking, oh my God, how will they get out of this one?! Everything played out very predictably, and because they had to cram so much into three hours, the story was always rushing to the next thing before you could finish digesting the last thing. Lots of great humor though, a final cameo by the late great Stan Lee, a beer belly Thor, CGI Michael Douglas from 1970, and some very touching moments, particularly with Stark and Hawkeye in scenes with their loved ones. Captain America's epilogue was also very sweet. The big battle near the end was visually spectacular, but as with many big special effects battles, just way too busy to make sense out of most of what's happening. Sensory overload. And it was over almost as soon as it started. Still, Endgame is a solid and worthwhile finish to the series, while not entirely amazing as a standalone film."},

This movie does an amazing job at wrapping up the Infinity Saga, and is truly for the fans. It takes you on a ride through the past 11 years in the MCU, going back in time, like a trip down memory lane. I loved every minute of it. The final battle is the most memorable in MCU History, topping Infinity War's battles on Titan and Wakanda, and makes the airport battle in Civil War look like a walk in the park. While the ending can be hard to understand (I won't give away what happens) but please note it takes place in an alternate timeline, NOT the main MCU timeline. Just wanted to clear that up, as the Russos said this. It does have some flaws, depending on what you envision for the characters, but overall, I loved every second of it and really truly believe there was no other way to truly tie every loose end and wrap everything up. It's much funnier than I would have thought, but it really works for this movie! RDJ and Chris Evans really leave it all in this movie, it was amazing. Some of their best work. More standouts include Paul Rudd, Scarlett Johansson, and Mark Ruffalo. Marvel really brought their A-Game with this one, and I would not miss this one. If you haven't seen an MCU film, I would recommend, Iron Man 1, Avengers 1, ALL The Captain America movies, Thor: Ragnarok, Ant Man and the Wasp, Black Panther, and obviously Infinity war."},

It takes you through a emotional rollercoaster with references sprinkled throughout, bringing you back to where it all began but has a few moments which make it just short of a 10. Captain Marvel was not needed in the movie and served as a ex machina, ruining one of the most epic scene in movie history where earth teams up to defeat thanos and destroys his spaceship in a scene that looked like a reskin of the last jedi which as we know, was not received so well. There were also some inconsistencies throughout the movie with some power scaling problems. An example is Captain America fighting past thanos and getting flung across but was able to handle his infinity gauntlet punch in infinity war? He was also able to summon mjonir because he was worthy, but if he could, why couldn't others? Thor was also seen fat but still was able to fit in his armor and time suit? I understand the material of the time suit might be flexible but armor doesn't have flexibility so we are supposed to assume he just burned fat in a day? Enough of negatives, let's get to the good parts! Throwbacks really caused me to tear up, especially the time travel back to guardians of the galaxy and original avengers as we've known them throughout all these years and movies. Humour was executed greatly in a movie with such a serious tone but worked. Occasionally throwing in jokes helps viewers recover. It is filled with fan service rewarding old fans but not alienating new fans with a simple plot and was sad to see such characters as Captain America go, seeing how they grew but passing on the torch to newcomers to the marvel franchise and I'm looking forward to see what they do next after thanos. We also continue to see the humanity of thanos and him breaking throughout the course of the MCU. We can see that he wanted to eliminate half the universe and when earth revolts, he offers a different solution but the goal stays the same, to let life live in an utopia and achieve peace which is reasonable, and how much he was willing to sacrifice, almost dying to destroy the stones themselves instead of keeping it with him as they served no purpose, showing his humanity and that he cared for people. Endgame also gave finality to the whole series when people started to say that they were the same movies over and over again and although I don't agree, I can see where they're coming from. Just hearing the theme and seeing the avengers team up for one last time was purely amazing and epic with a good ending. Having no end credit or mid credit scene might seem lazy or usual, I believe that that's intentional as they don't want it to be some opener for a bigger movie but an great end to a even greater series. Marvel, I love you 3000. 9/10"},

On the one hand Endgame has a number of exciting and unexpected scenes. But I have never in my life been more disappointed with a movie. First it's a full hour too long. Lots of slow pacing trying to establish relationships that either were or should have been established 5 movies ago. But the real problem with the film is it's inability to get you to suspend your disbelief. Speculative fiction, science fiction and fantasy are anchored on a single idea. There may be something fantastic, but it's internally consistent. If I have a magic broom that lets me fly, it can't suddenly in the middle of story develop the ability to make pop tarts. If it does, anything becomes possible and the story has no point. Endgame is riddled with internal inconsistencies. Because of that, suspending my disbelief became impossible. Good acting, good special effects and a really poor script."},
{"movie": "avengers-endgame", "user": "BrunoVn00", "score": "7", "date": "APR 30, 2019", "text": "Marvel movies, specifically MCU movies just became really hard to review, because like I heard somewhere on the internet: This is not a ****'s an event. Now sure, as an event it's fantastic. Full of fanservice and making every MCU fan finally getting what they always wanted makes this definitely a crowd-pleaser. I consider myself a fan of the MCU, but I'm also a fan of cinema in general...Which means that it's time to review it as an ACTUAL movie: The technical aspects are...Okay. The directing and cinematography are...Alright. I mean, they can't do much with that since almost the entire movie is CGI. Almost every shot has like a really strong depth-of-field blur that I just don't **** makes the shots feel fake. Seriously, I don't think there is a single moment where I think that the sets look real. It's not incompetent, obviously, but the entire movie just looks so artificial. Now, props to the VFX team because, once again, they did a fantastic job, specially with Thanos, like the previous movie, but seriously, the overuse of CGI just makes everything look...Once again...Fake. Character development? What is that? There is none! Once again, just like Infinity War, with a HUGE cast of characters, it's basically impossible to give every character enough screentime and relevance to the plot and that's what happens here. Sure, you could argue that the characters have arcs and resolutions and I agree, but those arcs didn't start in this movie, started in five movies prior. There's a five year gap between Infinity War and Endgame and we just see the change of our main characters...Offscreen. That was lazy as hell, having character arcs...Offscreen. Hulk's character was the worst. We see him at the beggining being Bruce Banner, just like in the previous movie and then after the offscreen five year gap, we see him turned into Professor Hulk (or Smart Hulk whatever the hell it's called. Like, they never mention his name anyways). Literally a couple minutes passed and we see that sudden change. Things like those just seem like lazy writing. Speaking about lazy writing: Sorry but making a movie about time travel has a 99% chance of making something that doesn't make any sense or contradicts itself. Sure, we are supposed to suspend our disbelief as many MCU movies basically have the logic of a cartoon, but still, all this time travel stuff just left me wondering SOOO many things. Like, how is that you can't bring back a character that died? Didn't they established that if you take something from the past it doesn't affect your current timeline, just that timeline or some **** like that. The movie feels like it doesn't have a real threat throughout most of it. In the previous one we had Thanos from beggining to end. Here, we barely have Thanos. He now comes into the plot because the writers felt that they needed a big fight at the end. The way Thanos ends up appearing is just full of plot conveniences. Seriously, the writing, if you think about it, is so dumb. In the previous movie, Thanos was a very well developed villain with a clear motivation. Here, he changed his motivation and he just became the generic bad guy that just wants to destroy the universe. So lame. Of course among the genuinely positive things we have Alan Silvestri's score which might be the best score in any Avengers movie. We have the acting. This is arguably the best performance of the main cast (Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth) in any Avengers movie ever. We have the pacing, which was really good because the movie constantly moved forward. It was three hours long but it never felt like it. It's a three hour long movie I could rewatch in its entirety at any time. Overall, as a MOVIE (in the filmmaking aspect) it is definitely a competent movie. Sure the writing is really dumb at times and the overuse of CGI might be a detriment, but pretty much the rest of the aspects are really solid. This feels like a great payoff. This feels like a satisfactory conclusion to this 22-movie franchise and the character resolutions were really well executed (even though one just makes me ask so many questions). I really enjoyed it because, like I said, I like watching MCU movies, but I need to stop wearing my fan glasses and admit the positives and negatives of the filmmaking aspect of this movie."},

No matter the few plot holes (which all MCU movies had), the few inconsistencies between characters from comic books and MCU (which always happened as well), it is a movie made for fans that have been following the Infinity Stones storyline, which covered movies from Captain America, Thor, Guardians of the Galaxy, Doctor Strange and, obviously, Avengers. Without spoiling the movie, I can say that \"Avengers: Endgame\" starts well by setting up the audience with a new reality after the advents from \"Avengers: Infinity War\". This is followed by an intense and well-designed confrontation, where it gets enjoyable to perceive how the different personalities of our heroes engage, namely between the rational down-to-earth nature of Iron Man and the overoptimistic nature of Captain America. This leads us to the resolution of the movie, which sets an intense and emotional climax as never seen in any other MCU movie, leading us to a final breath-taking outcome of the entire MCU plot. For me, and so far, definitely the best MCU movie, and hence the reason for my MCU-contextualized score."},

I still remember seeing the first Iron Man movie in the cinema and I never would have thought it would bring us here. As always this is a spoiler free review but I do recommend avoiding all reviews until you’ve seen Avengers: Endgame for yourself. Honestly you should avoid all reviews and social media in general because not all of us are adhering to the #DontSpoilTheEndgame request by the Russo Brothers. So if you’re the type of person who would intentionally spoil a film like this for someone else you’re the type of person who deserves to be wiped out with a single snap of the fingers. Set immediately after the events of Avengers: Infinity War, the universe is trying to come to terms with the devastating effects after half of the universe have been wiped out. The remaining Avengers are determined to do whatever it takes to try and undo Thano’s actions. I wouldn’t be a huge fan of all the Marvel movies, Age of Ultron and Civil War for me had a lot of problems yet what saved them was the characters and what drives Endgame is the characters we’ve come to know and love over this long journey. I loved Endgame, my heart was racing, I was on the edge of my seat. All the previous films have led up to this moment and no time is wasted diving straight in. With a three hour running time it’s not the type of film you want to buy a giant bucket of coke for unless you’re prepared to leave the cinema to use the bathroom, because don’t let these so called online bathroom guides fool you, there is no part of Endgame worth missing. I can’t speak for everyone but those were the quickest three hours of my life. Despite that I did feel a certain few characters were not given the screen time they maybe deserved, though I understand it would be difficult to give everyone their moment with a cast this big, even with the lengthy running time it just isn’t possible. Though maybe we could have done with a little less of the Hulk eating lunch and a little more Okoye, whatever I’ll get over it. You’ll laugh, you’ll cry and you’ll cheer along with the film. There’s nothing better than being in a packed cinema screen with die-hard fans of the franchise. A spectacular cinematic achievement with a very satisfying ending. A real sense of closure, yes that means no post credits scene so feel free to make a mad dash for the bathroom if you’re not a blubbering mess by the end. It may go without saying but yes you really do have to have seen most of the other Avenger movies, if you haven’t you really won’t get much out of Endgame.

A mix of plot holes, inconsistencies, paradoxes and logic defying rules of time travel about which I can talk for hours. I will rather not get into that to keep this review short. My next issue is with how they mishandled some characters. The most obvious victims to this, but certainly not the only ones, were Hulk, Thanos and Thor. Even humour was not working. You have to make sure to not cross a line when something instead of funny becomes annoying, cringey or even outright disrespectful and offensive. I feel like they failed at finding the right balance in Endgame. The butt of almost all jokes became Thor. Instead of making him funny though, like in Ragnarok we loved, they made us to laugh AT him. They simply turned one of the strongest characters in MCU into a joke and scrapped like 10 years of his character development when he just gave up on his people. That was cheap. Another thing that kept me bothering were the SJW moments. As a woman I love to see strong female characters, but this felt forced. All in all the movie is in my humble opinion a mix of lazy writing, fanservises, and a lot of money that went into its production in hopes that under all that glitter and expensive CGI people will not notice just how weak the plot is.

{"movie": "avengers-endgame", "user": "IsaacJ", "score": "9", "date": "APR 29, 2019", "text": "The Marvel Cinematic Universe has certainly revolutionised modern cinema; back in 2008, Iron Man opened to positive reviews but few foresaw the cultural phenomenon this world was to become and the generation of adoring fans it was to muster. Eleven years on and the highly anticipated climax of this particular saga of the MCU hits the screens; Avengers: Endgame. Its predecessor, Avengers: Infinity War may have ended on a rather low note for Earth’s mightiest heroes, as intergalactic despot Thanos succeeded in wiping out half the universe, but they return in full force in this ambitious and decidedly bombastic conclusion. From the beginning, Marvel old hands The Russo Brothers paint a very new world, a greyer one wracked by Thanos’ deadly ‘Snap’. Among the surviving Avengers, there’s a strong sense of survivor’s guilt and very little sense of hope… yet it would be unlike the characters we know to not make one last attempt to save the universe. To divulge in any more detail the plot of Avengers: Endgame would be to severely undermine its impact; this is a cinematic thrill-ride, with surprises aplenty, nodding dollops of fan service and a hefty level of emotional stakes. One thought the sheer scale of Infinity War was seismic, but the Russos outdo themselves with Endgame, crafting a climactic and grandiose, but equally satisfying conclusion to a decade of work. It’s a different beast to its predecessors in many ways, but Endgame still manages to pull off that nifty balance between humour and drama that makes Marvel work. The film can only be described as a victory lap for Marvel, a love letter to their characters and fans. After a brilliantly unexpected prologue, the film takes a little while to find its rhythm, but once it does… it really does. Credit is due particularly to Christopher Markus’ and Stephen McFeely’s script, a quick-witted and compassionate piece of work that propels the story breezily through its three-hour run time. Despite the Avengers’ predicament, it isn’t all doom and gloom; the benefits of a smaller ensemble cast allow Endgame to have that same sense of banter from Joss Whedon’s Avengers Assemble, something that occasionally felt missed within the tidal action of the latter part of Infinity War. Within the first hour, the plot is taken on a definitive path, one that is neither untrodden (there is a memorable comic sequence where the characters wryly commentate on this) nor particularly smooth (plot inaccuracies can easily be raised). Despite this, however, it allows the film to take off on what can only be described as a golden reward for Marvel fans, an action-packed feast of a film that pays due homage to its universe. There’s also a biting edge to Endgame though in its emotional resonance, frequently heart-breaking yet never gratuitous. There are so many aspects that are so caringly rendered in Endgame; Alan Silvestri’s diverse score and the textured visual effects spring eagerly to mind. As always in a Marvel caper, the cast is a blisteringly good ensemble effort. In Endgame, every actor is on top form, bouncing off eachother with natural ease. Josh Brolin’s scene-stealing Thanos from Infinity War is disappointingly less on show here, but this is almost made up for the excellent use of some of the previous film’s more underused players (Chris Evans’ Captain America and Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow are given meatier roles here). A special mention should also go to Robert Downey Jr in a performance that radiates power and poignancy. Avengers: Endgame does sacrifice itself occasionally in the complex myriad of stories it tells; at points, there are a few too many of these vignettes and the film can feel a tad clunky (Infinity War gave the arc to its villain to combat this). However, the paths all lead pretty much perfectly together in a third act that is indisputably awesome and packs an emotive punch. Avengers: Endgame is a monumental piece of cinema, both in scale and significance; these stories have defined childhoods and, here, a fitting end is delivered to this part that not only feels satisfyingly conclusive but is excellently put together by the creative force behind it. Colossal and captivating, this is another sure success from the team at Marvel that looks difficult to beat."},

Right from the start it has ponderously long scenes. The same story could have been presented in 2 hours without losing a word. Other problems include never learning why Dr. Strange did what he did at the end of Infinity War, a funny but unexplained change to the Hulk, and a major plot device we have already seen in an X-Men movie, a plot device that renders all drama going forward meaningless. Nothing that happens in the next Spider-Man movie, nothing that happens in the upcoming Black Widow movie, matters ... at all. All problems are now, according to what Endgame established, completely fixable after the fact. Finally, Captain Marvel is MUCH too powerful. In one scene (I'll be vague to avoid spoilers) she destroys something very very very large simply by flying through it. If she can do that, none of the other Avengers are really even relevant. Also, I recall that no one but Thor could lift Thor's hammer, so why is Captain America running around with it like it weighs 10 pounds? The good stuff: great scenes with Tony Stark; great scenes with Steve Rogers. In fact, without the personal touches regarding Tony and Steve I would have given this movie a 5. There were a handful of jokes that made the audience roar with laughter but I was in the last row and the jokes were spoken so softly by the characters I couldn't hear what was being said. But I will assume they were great and so list them under the positives. And that's about it. Not spectacular. Though I do give the writers credit for weaving so many characters into the mix (though not enough Black Widow fight scenes for my taste)."},

If you read this review, first I had to warn you that there would be spoilers. I laughed and cried and sometimes I cheered for unusual and things I wanted to happen. The acting was way better than last time in Avengers: Infinity War (2018). I really am impressed, especially Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans, they're the best! The actions and fight scenes were the most EPIC. The scenes were mostly unforgettable. I could remember a lot after watching it for the first time. Every character were there (except Vision, Black Widow (cuz she's dead) and maybe M'Baku (I haven't seen him). There were portals everywhere and the final battle was a lot better than I had expected. Here are my top 10 best scenes of the movie: 1. \"Portals\" or \"Avengers Assemble\" 2. Iron-Man's Death and Funeral 3. Cap Wields Mjolnir 4. Banner mixed brains and brawns together into Professor Hulk 5. Cap shared a dance with Peggy Carter (extremly emotional) 6. Black Widow's sacrifice 7. Thor chops off Thanos' head 8. Thor joins the Guardians of the Galaxy 9. Cap, Iron-Man and Thor vs Thanos 10. Iron-Man and Nebula reunited to the remaining Avengers Some scenes were hilarious like Thor changed into an overweight man and ate junk food, drank beer and played Fortnite with Korg. Some were emotionally sad like when Iron-Man died and his funeral was attended by lots of people, when Cap shared his dance with his wife Peggy Carter that he never had time to do that (the saddest part of that scene was the song, I cried so much) and Black Widow sacrificed for the soul stone. The lines were really iconic to me like \"I am inevitable\" by Thanos and Iron-Man's last words before he snapped his fingers \"And ****...Iron-Man\" or when Ant-Man called Cap’s buttocks “America’s Ass” (that was funny cuz Cap’s butts are…big”.. It was so strange was that Steve Rogers retired being Captain America but I was glad that The Cap generation passed on to someone else and it was Falcon (Sam Wilson). Also I’m impress what they had done to Hulk, mixing his self and Hulk’s strength (brains and brawns) into Professor Hulk (that’s how they called) but I had a thought that they had ruined Thor (his big belly and “hobo” hair) but it was still fine because no matter how he changed, he was still a hero and he still remained funny. The sountrack was marvelous, better than in Infinity War. Alan Silvestri did an excellent job, especially \"Portals\", I liked that one most. The Marvel Studios intro wasn't how I expected it to be. It was a little unsuitable but I liked the song and when Cap danced ith Peggy, the song “it’s been a long long time” was 100% suitable which made the scene unforgettable and of course, sad also made the ending one of the best superhero movie endings. The movie's 3 hours and 1 minute was well-used. No scenes were useless or unnecessary at all. The ending was moving but perfect and someday, I wanted to watch this again and again. I just hope it would deserve 2020's Oscars's Best Picture, Best VFX, Best Original Score, Best Costumes and more. Avengers: Endgame is the greatest movie of 2019 and perhaps one of the best of the 2010s and maybe of all time. This is a MUST-SEE. Also, I don’t rate this 9.8 because I’m a big Marvel fan, but I am being fair to the point means the movie deserved a 9.8. I just hope it topped Avatar (2009) at the box office. Now it’s being $1,223,641,414 worldwide. It's one of the movies that gave me more than two emotions and being a blend of humor, action and heart"},

EDIT: Metacritic, WTF are you doing to my new lines? --Minor Spoilers follow-- First, the good: This movie brings a solid and satisfying conclusion to the stories of some of the main avengers, and felt like a proper send-off to some of the best characters. The acting was A+, the effects were par for a Marvel movie, and the overall plot felt like a good continuation of Infinity War. --The Mixed-- This was kind of expected, but the way to figure out how to beat the most powerful being in the universe who has control of all of space and time felt like a giant deus ex machina. SPOILER: it's time travel. The Bad: Apparently, the original plan was to not feature Captain Marvel, and it shows. Her inclusions in the movie come out of left field and ultimately don't add much to the story. There were also a few scenes that broke continuity who's only purpose seemed to be to feature a bunch of female characters kicking butt. It felt as if they were just tacking things on to check off some boxes so the media hounds don't give them negative reviews. These things can be done well, as we saw with movies like Rogue One, but it was not done well here. Finally, there's never a rebuttal to Thanos's theory that the universe needs to be culled in order to survive. This theory was presented so strongly in Infinity War that I had a few friends thinking \"yeah, you know? Thanos was right. Thanos is the true hero!\". This movie does nothing to change our minds about that. To follow up on my Captain Marvel review, I called it (...mostly): Captain marvel is so powerful she singlehandedly wins the final battle for the Avengers, but she doesn't defeat Thanos. Frankly, it was pretty satisfying to see Thanos punch her smug face and send her flying, especially considering that was the first blow she receives on-screen after unlocking her full power in the Captain Marvel movie."},

I think found the biggest issues it faced were that they just have too many big characters in the Avengers that you simply can't do justice to them all - credit where credit is due they did pretty well. In fairness they did focus heavily on the older characters, and rightly so, however it missed an opportunity to do more with the newer ones as a result. Also Capt Marvel is way to over powered. I was also hoping for more of a feel good ending, this is why we watch these movies right? Anyway all in all it was a good run, but not as good as its predecessors in my opinion."},

La partie spoiler est en rouge avec une mention bien visible. Donc si vous n’avez pas vu le film, évitez d’aller y faire un tour étant donné que le film regorge de moments épiques et surprenants. Je préviens aussi que certains passages de Captain Marvel et d’Ant-Man et la Guêpe vont être évoqués pour mieux comprendre le début de l’histoire. Pour commencer, sachez qu’une bonne connaissance du MCU n’est pas négligeable pour comprendre Endgame. Si vous avez révisés avant l’interro, ça sera bien plus simple. Nous allons évoquer la partie de l’histoire qui a déjà été dévoilée, à savoir que le film commence une vingtaine de jours après le génocide de Thanos laissant une partie de nos héros sur Terre, et d’autres sur Titan. Cependant, deux absents font leur apparition, Scott Lang qui qui resté bloqué dans le monde quantique et Carole Danvers qui a accouru (ou volé) lorsque Fury a activé son signal. Clint Barton est également de retour mais pas en Hawkeye mais sous l’apparence de Ronin, qui est terriblement badass. Tout ce petit monde tente de se remettre du terrible sort de leurs amis et familles et décide donc de s’attaquer à Thanos dans un dernier élan d’héroïsme. Et… on coupe pour la partie sans spoilers. Oui c’est très court mais je ne peux pas vous en dire plus sinon ça gâchera l’histoire et les surprises, et il y en a tout un tas. Vous l’aurez compris, Endgame est le dernier recours des Avengers, frappés par le chagrin. Chacun vit son deuil à sa manière que ce soit Captain America qui garde une confiance en l’avenir et le fait de vivre avec l’idée que rien ne changera, ou Thor qui le traite d’une autre façon et très drôle vous verrez. Le film se concentre aussi d’avantage sur les membres fondateurs du groupe, mais aussi sur certains personnages qui ont une partie importante dans l’histoire comme Ant-Man ou Captain Marvel. C’est difficile de parler du film sans spoiler, c’est pour ça que je vais m’arrêter là. Pour les curieux, une partie spoils est en dessous en rouge. Explosif, drôle, émouvant et surprenant, Avengers: Endgame met la barre encore plus haut qu’Infinity War ! Le film joue avec nos sentiments comme un oscilloscope. On passe du rire aux larmes et parfois même le souffle coupé par certaines scènes. Les personnages sont très émouvants, les batailles sont épiques et le sens du fan-service est à son paroxysme vers le second et dernier tier du film. Merci Marvel pour ce grand spectacle."},

There time was good, but MetaCritic's time is now. Thank you MetaCritic for not denying people freedom of speech and being corrupt. The 3 hours was unnecessary. First hour is filled with bad jokes and lines that sound like they were written by 5 year old. They spend time on things that don't matter. We want to see Iron man struggle in creating the time machine, we want to see Captain marvel searching to find Iron-man, we want to see Ant-man being abandoned in the void. We don't want to see people eating with hulk at a dinner talking about how they shouldn't give up hope and that the time machine idea is good. Like, seriously way too much time in convincing people to do things that they shouldn't need convincing of or we DID NOT NEED TO SEE. Then Captain america ruined the whole time theory they set up. If he went back in time and married her, then that means there were 2 captain Americas and he somehow stayed in hiding never got recognized. But then also, in a previous movie he banged her child, so presumably that means either she was never born because he married her. OR perhaps that means Captain america always was with her and then that means he **** his own daughter. But still that would mean that there should currently be one old Captain america and a young one. But we only see the old one. There should be two. And the shield was also supposed to go to Bucky. This project took years and it is just barely not ****. They made the first one good, so they didn't need to try on this one I guess.

I felt nothing when Black Widow jumped to her death, which was one of the few parts of this movie that actually made sense, sacrificing someone dear to get the soulstone. But what it came down to is the cliched classic jump back in time travel plot, however it wasn't supposed to be like Back in the Future, so they say.

You can hate it but definitely you must recognize that what Marvel Studios built with this franchise is something that will hardly be seen again in this industry. Superhero films existed before Iron Man and the MCU but the ambition of this project completely surpassed everything else. That the audience that perhaps didn’t care about comic books at all was so involved with this saga and followed it until the end says a lot. The tears that the people next to me spilled in the theater only confirmed it. Like Infinity War this film may not be able to sustain itself without the whole concept but as I said at the time about that film I come to repeat here as well. This isn't about that. If after 22 interlaced films you can not understand it, what's the point of saying more about it? Its achievements are numerous. Even with three hours of duration the film never feels heavy, perhaps a little overwhelming for the amount of things happening at the same time but the narrative hardly falls into bumps that make it feel slow or boring. The story is emotional enough especially in the end, even when they reach levels never seen before of fan service, everything feels in its place and I think the most devoted fans will be satisfied. The final battle is spectacular, finally I felt as if I were watching a comic book taking life from the pages to the big screen because the scale and the number of characters make it the most epic battle of the whole saga. But even in spite of its achievements it also has its faults. Despite the lenght you can feel the holes in the story. The visual effects vary too much because in some points it looks pretty good and in others it gets to look very bad. Even the CGI varies in quality because the work is so detailed in Thanos but so simple in Hulk. Even the soundtrack in spite of the quality is not as emotive as that of Infinity War. And for the same reason due to the size of the plot, many characters end up reduced to very small moments in screen. And of the three characters that closed their circle in this film, I must say that the ending of Black Widow was quite bad compared to that of Iron Man and Captain America. Avengers: Endgame closes a cycle and closes it with solidity in a very entertaining show. It's the film that was expected to be and as I said closes a monumental chapter in this franchise in terms of narrative and characters and at the same time laying the foundations for what is to come. Will a new saga of 10 years and more films follow? I don't know, and part of me doubts it, but no matter what happens in the coming years, the achievements of this franchise will undoubtedly be unforgettable for a lot of people."},

Because, I think it's fair to give it 77 despite of to give 80 or more score. Because; it totally does not deserve the score they gave on this movie at IMDB. Secondly, it is not a bad movie and actually I liked this movie, however it can not be a cult for neither me nor the people who is not the fan of Marvel Cinematic/Comic Universe. Furthermore, I'm speaking with truth that I am a fan of Marvel Cinematic Universe. Even so, it couldn't change my score on this movie. If it is needed to say the reasons that I gave this score. 1.From the very beginning of the movie to mid-break, it gives the feelings about how is the life after Infinity War and tells us which character doing what. Of course its telling level of tales is upper than some stage as usual, however it is not the best even if you look at in the whole corpus of Avengers. 2.After mid-break things starts to move a li'l bit. And a humor that is above the average will wait you on this part. 3.I can't tell what is exactly going on that scene because of the fact that it's a spoiler, but something that told by Bruce Banner in a very complicated manner at a very very li'l amount of time will be contradicts what is happening on the last scene of the movie. And again it is something about 'time' to give a clue for the folks who already watched the movie. 4. The very best scene is I think the fight scene. And it is not a spoiler that there is a fight on this movie. Almost everything gets concluded on this part even I'm almost satisfied with this part. 5.However, I want to ask to the producers, scenarists and directors of the whole hacking Hollywood that 'Why the hack that you intrude feminism on all movies. Yeah we understood there is also heroines, amazons and lots of armpit hair. So, you don't need to forcibly attached feminism and anti-racism on every single movie. We all know that women are worthy creatures just like men and we also can say it for the black and white and even for yellow what's more green people.' So if those 3rd and 5th reasons wouldn't be here I could give 80 point to this very high potentialed movie, however I'm telling it in mouth of gloom that I gave 70/100 on it."},

The shocking conclusion to Infinity War left it on a major cliffhanger and the Russo Brothers had a difficult task. Give it a satisfying conclusion, while also giving everything closure. Despite a few small issues I had with it, this movie is a must see. It is very somber and a dark story but I was happily surprised to see that it wasn’t totally dark that it had lots of humor thrown in and it never felt forced. The humor was great and while the overall tone is very dark after all, Infinity War ended on a dark note, it really kept things going. The first act was great and really set up the stage. My only two complaints about the film are that it introduces a concept that sounds great on paper but will cause your head to hurt the more you think about it. I though reminded myself it’s a comic book movie and not everything has to make sense. It is a good twist of events regardless. The other part is that the movie is a tad bit too long. It has a great first and final act but the middle act does drag on a little bit. It’s not boring by any stretch but it could’ve been streamlined a bit. The climax though is fantastic. It had the best battle in the entire MCU if you ask me and the ending was genius. So with that being said. I will state that unless you’re a huge fan of the MCU you may not care for it that much but if you’re willing to watch at least the main character films and the Avengers movies, or at bare minimum, the Avengers movies [Civil War as well because it was very important] you probably will be very lost. It throws a lot out there. While I do still have the opinion that the first Avengers is my favorite in the MCU, this is excellent and right behind it. It nails everything from the tone, pacing [despite some small issues I mentioned] and resolution that I fully recommend seeing it. See it in theaters if you’re a fan and as soon as possible and try to avoid spoilers because it’s that damn good and well worth experiencing the shocking twists that do come."},

One: watch the other MCU films, or use the (not recommended) Lazy Man's Cheat Code and read the synopsis of each. Two: Do not expect the same level of character development world building from Endgame as past MCU films. (Character development is not the same as character arc completion). I was bothered when I walked out of Endgame last night without the feeling of catharsis that I expected. It did not feel as fresh and invigorating as movies before it—even its predecessor Infinity War breathed more new life into me. I went into expecting a cinematic masterpiece, and that is where I went wrong. Making the \"Greatest Movie of [variable time frame here]\" was never the Russo Brothers' intention. With 22 films preceding this one, there are plenty of moments of cinematic greatness, ESPECIALLY amongst the movies in Phase III. Endgame is not a masterpiece. But it IS a love letter to every fan who was grown with the characters, whether they've been along for the ride since '08 or found themselves binge watching each film in the weeks before its release. Don't expect a movie that ascends to new heights in filmmaking, and DEFINITELY don't watch this movie without being caught up on what happens before it.

Endgame is funny, depressing, satisfying and very enjoyable and everyone gave their all (for one) in this film as some actor/actress will probably never return for the MCU after this film. There were a lot of easter eggs from this movie which links to the other films in this universal which was awesome to hear especially at the end. Everyone has a good reason why they make these decisions and doesn't leave the viewer confused. Overall, the action scenes were satisfying and awesome, the ending was a great conclusion to this movie and just in general, this was (almost) the perfect marvel movie and it's definitely worth your 3 hours of life The reason I said almost is because of these reasons: 1. Captain Marvel was barely in the movie, they made an entire movie about her and yet you didn't really need to watch it for Endgame as she's rarely in it and she was in the climax of the movie. Plus Brie Larson was horrible in this film and I know that she is a fantastic actress which disappoints me even further 2. The movie is funny. Maybe too funny. There are so many emotional scenes in this film but then they quack a few jokes in there which sure they're funny but it destroys the flow of some tear-jerker moments 3. Speaking of the flow, when they finish a dark, miserable scene, they immediately go to a bright, happy scene which just confuses me. Why could they just slowly tune down the darker scene and slowly build up into a relatively happy scene? However, with all the negatives, I will probably rewatch this movie again"},
{"movie": "avengers-endgame", "user": "DefinitelyMayb", "score": "6", "date": "APR 27, 2019", "text": "Avengers:End game is by far a much better film than Infinity War. More structured and more cohesive than the mess that was IW. That being said, I think the film is a very good conclusion to the last 10 year journey, which I have been part of since watching the first Iron Man during my high school days. What I loved about the film was that it took a lot of risks and some much needed character conclusion to their arks. In a funny world, these characters would have survived indefinitely and continue to rake in millions of dollars for the Disney overlords, but I must commend Kevin Fegie, the directors and screenwriters to actually end most of their storylines. A lot of care was taken in terms of the direction of the characters and what this film would end. The meta aspects of this film was particularly satisfying with those who have followed all the films will enjoy the subversions offered throughout this 3 hour epic. That said this film is far from perfect, with many of the same flaws still very much present. First, despite its epicness, much of the films drag into 3 distinct sections that I don't think add to being a very good cinematic experience. One massive annoyance is the tonal fluctations that seem to drag this movie down much like in IW. For example, in the first Act which reflects on the aftermath of Thanos's successful plan, we get some really dramatic scenes, then suddenly we get the usual MCU exposition/comedy scenes all fitted within adjacent to one another. One moment Black widows talking about something serious, and then another character talks about peanut butter sandwhiches. This is one of the painful things about the recent MCU films is the lack of dedication to the more dramatic aspects of their situation. First act on repeat viewings would have the feeling on dragging on because pretty much no action takes place. Another problem is that despite having these character moments, I dont think the film does a good job exploring these characters properly and in fact, there is little introspective of the sitatuion. We get to see for example, Captain America talk about how to move on in some sort of help group, but then we get little world-building of the tragedy that occured during IW. One thing I keep saying is that as the MCU keeps getting bigger and expanding, the world keeps feeling smaller and indifferent. For example, where is the military, why doesnt the film show what happens to the governments in Earth and other parts, where is Thunderbolt Ross, Martin Freeman's character, what about the villains? etc. We get very little of this but only a focus on the Avengers who lets face it, don;t really do much or is needed. Another poor thing that becomes apparent with the MCU is the lack of any villains/antagonists that are developed or survive long enough to be part of this. It feels like a missed opportunity in this film to actually get a sense of a bigger world at large. The movie then becomes a time travel/heist movie that is actually the most enjoyable. Despite some nitpicky time travel issues, I think this part was the most interesting and definitely the most worth in repeat viewings. However, this again was not a lot of actions and the characters splitting up made only some duos more interesting (ie Cap and Iron Man), whereas the pair of Black Widow/Hawkeye & WarMachine/Nebula were definitely boring and generic. There is also a lot of conveniences in this film which becomes more noticable on repeat viewings. The final act, is a massive fight and deeply rewarding on an action perspective. Whilst it is good, its certainly still not as good as the Russo's brothers previous efforts. WE get glimpses of all the good characters fighting and there are some genuinely jaw dropping moments such as Captain America picking up Mjolinir and the avengers assembling for the final fight. Lots of CGI which is a mix big unfortunately. That being said, this was a much enjoyable film. The mixed feeling/score is reflective on the lack of cinematic quality and annoyance in that the film does many good stuff, but then is let down on other crucial aspects. Other things such as handing the mantle to Falcon, lack of emotional scene for Black Widow become bug bears on repeat viewings. Overall, this was still a satisfying experience, but for the sake of MCU, I hope they improve on the story and characters more in the future endeavours and be more like Winter Soldier, First Iron Man and Civil War which I think still are their best films."},

Not that there aren't going to be anymore movies. Disney likes making money. But with several main actors' contracts being up and bowing out, this will be the end for several of the original Avengers team. What results is something we've never quite see in a film: a season finale, the culmination of a franchise of multiple movies, characters, and story arcs. (The sheer logistics involved making this must've been insane.) And I had the hell of a time with it all! The one big issue about Avengers: Infinity War, the first installment of this film two-parter, is that it had to juggle so many characters, that there wasn't a lot of time for characterization. However, now the cast is narrowed down to mostly the original Avengers. Brought back is the characterization that made so many of the previous films. Here we find the heroes at their lowest and trying to right things. What proceeds is a great character piece We see the conclusion to some of stories of people we've gotten to know after all these years. The finale is the most I've ever been emotionally influenced by a film. Although this is an ensemble piece, Robert Downey Junior's Tony Stark/Iron Man is the big lead, the hero that started the whole universe off and all his scenes, his highs and low, are great. Thanos is in less of this, but the cool, collected planner still makes a great villain. Fans of the movie also get to see callbacks to so many plot points and surprise character appearances. (Although, some things might fly over your head if you can't remember or haven't had the time or inclination to watch everything.) In fact, be prepared for many surprises in general. There is some pretty serious subject matter here, especially the first act. However the script manages to nicely balance this with humor. Both Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Paul Rudd as Ant-Man have some great delivery and lines. The movie looks great. (Again, the ability to make Thanos' facial expressions look so realistic is amazing.) Although, I wished some scenes were lit a little brighter. You can't always make everything out. The final fight scene is amazing and may be considered one of the all time greats. Admittedly, the movie doesn't have quite the tension of Infinity Wars. The second act is interesting, but not as strong as the beginning or end. Considering the hype of Captain Marvel being in this, she really isn't used much. Karen Gillan does a great job as Nebula and she appears more than in any of her other films, but I kind of still wanted to see more interaction between her the and the other cast mates. A majority of characters from previous films are in this, but if you wanted to find out whatever happened to Lady Sif or Sharon Carter be prepared to be disappointed. I'm really surprised about Sharon, considering that the directors who forged her character did this movie, too. Overall, this movie was an event that will make you feel all the feels, and I recommend you see this before it's spoiled. P.S. Don't worry about sticking through the credits. No end final scene this time. (They really wanted to set this up as a final chapter.) Thought there is a slight something if you're a movie completionist."},

It also deftly incorporates humor that actually works and in just the right amounts at just the right times. Where it fails, though, it comes up supremely disappointing, such as lazily drawing upon time-worn plot devices that show a lack of imagination, a closing sequence that goes on far too long, giving short shrift to a number of key characters and employing a screenplay that all too often assumes viewer awareness of material from previous installments in this and related franchises (a real problem if one hasn't seen all the movies in question, something that many other cinematic franchises have successfully managed to avoid).

There are movies with stronger stories, there are movies with stronger visual effects, but in general all of them are good..... up until Avengers Endgame. Can I say that I regret that I watched it? No... after all I wanted to see what they think about this, how Marvel see ending of Infinity Saga. Everything in this shared universe was build somehow with the idea of this movie and in the end we receive some strange comedy. The best thing in the movie was constant flow of stupid jokes from every character. It wasn't about superheroes anymore. Half of the characters received some strange \"development\" which totally change who they are and turn them either in whiny baby or in stupid nerd. Marvel constantly breaks the rule of time travelling which they put in the movie. They just try to explain something and in a few scenes after that they do something totally different it seems to be alright. But even this is not the problem.... the problem is time travel itself. This was more like they wanted to play some nostalgia on the viewers, than to build some story. Yea, its nice to remember all this good movies, but I WANTED to see some original story. I understand that it is hard always to create something original and totally different... but come on, that was final of 21 movies and 10 years of development and you was lazy to think for something different than Time Travel? We just go back in time and fix it. Human imagination is endless and you came wit this. Especially in comic books where multiverse is integral part of the universe, we just time travel and fix the wrong. I expected to see that 50% of all living forms remained in one universe while other 50% have be send in other multiverse or something like that. More complicated scenario, where of course we will save everyone, but it will have some interesting and logical explanation why. That plot was slap in the face for me. The weakest plot in all MCU in a movie which actually needed to show the best of it. And even not like the movie was that bad... it was watchable. There was good moments, good visual effects. If it was for example some generic movie as Deadpool or Shazam or Ant-man... I would say ok, not the best plot, but nice movie, but not for Avengers, not after all this year. It just needed to be much much more, they could do it, we deserved it. The way they retire old avengers was ridiculous. As Marvel itself said, everything should come to an end, but their end should be Infinity wars, not this... they really make one step after the end and break everything beautiful in it. So I would personally put even lower score, because they have failed to make a good ending, but after all if we forget about the story (which actually for me was the biggest part of the score) it was good movie as quality.

Some nitpicks can be said about some technical or scientifical things but this is a movie with a walking, talking, sentient tree and racoon so those are minor issues for me. This movie has minor flaws but still the good parts of this movie outweigh the bad parts by a mile."},

Negatives: There are some girl power scenes that are just too conspicuous. I would have rather had the messages conveyed to me in a more subtle way and not rammed down my throat. Speaking of conspicuous, Bree Larson is out of place in Endgame. Her scenes with the other cast members in some way seem as if they were not a part of the original plan for the movie. The chemistry was just not there. I don't have a problem with Bree or her causes, she can express her opinion on whatever she likes. I just don't think she is ready to take the mantle as Marvels next big attraction. The next problem I had with Endgame is some of the character arcs the directors decided to use for Thor and Hulk. There is definitely some room for improvement. Now for the positives! The movie, for the most part, is a fantastical journey of over 11 years culminated into one giant thank you to the fans of the comic, and moviegoers alike. I loved the action, the heartache, and the triumphal moments that Endgame provided over the 3 hours of film time. You find yourself cheering, crying, and on the edge of your seat at times wanting to see your favorite Avenger give his or her due to Thanos. Thor and Rocket are hilarious! This movie is not a waste of time and you will be thoroughly entertained."},

Sometimes a bit slow, sometimes a bit tóó much comic relief, and some weird decisions regarding character development, but somehow, it all works, like pieces finally fitting in a magnificent (not at all perfect, but magnificent) puzzle. The two first acts are steady and are greatly dedicated to the core characters, as the third act focuses on the ultimate fight, crafting one of the most epic shots I have ever seen in movie history, and by far my favorite shot from the entire MCU. Regarding the title, Endgame truly feels like an end, and as a rather perfect one for that matter (certainly if you're an MCU fan -- in which case you will experience what is probably the most satisfying ending of a film ever), wrapping up the entire Infinity Saga with some emotional but primarily satisfying and in a way beautiful (dare I say perfect) ending. The screenplay goes through a rough patch due to its complex story, but still manages to deliver a cohesive film. As acting performances are concerned, Downey and Evans again do whatever it takes to pull off the portryal of their legendary characters, but it is Jeremy Renner and Chris Hemsworth who are really performing like their lives depend on it. Ruffalo looks like he had the best time ever shooting this flick, while performances of Johansson and Brolin are steady as ever. As I previously stated, the ending is perfect. There is absolutely no way anyone can guess how the story goes, as Marvel is trying to be as inventive as they can. I am extremely satisfied with Avengers: Endgame, a culmination film that exceeds expectations (that were already pretty high) and that does everything it can to be as spectacular, jaw-dropping and bombastic as possible. Again, satisfying is the word. And epic. And complex. But mostly satisfying and epic."},

I’m someone who has never been to see a film twice at a cinema and I’m already trying to find excuses for another viewing, I rarely enjoy watching the same film twice in a year and with this I’m considering twice in the same week it is just that good and I cannot recommend it enough. See it, I do not know how you could not enjoy this film. I also want to mention, I saw nothing of this film, no trailers, no early reviews literally nothing and it made it that much better, now I don’t know if that would affect the experience but there may have been parts I was loving but people already knew of because it was in a trailer. In addition to that, I had not planned to see this movie in the cinema at all, because I hadn’t been as excited for superhero films as of late, silly me to assume a Marvel movie is just a simple superhero movie. But a friend of mine asked when am I going and when I said don’t think I will he responded with so much shock and told me that I have to see it, I booked my tickets there and then, two days before he gets to see it while at the same time being one of the people who saw it opening night. So, you can see my expectations were so low and yet I feel like I can say that was perhaps one of if not the single greatest piece of media that I’ve ever consumed in my life. Being someone who grew up with Marvel movies starting as a child and now being considered a adult to watch this celebration of this cinematic universe truly was magic. It was a love letter to itself in the best possible way, it would have small hints towards previous films that made you proud to be a fan, the last word in the big climactic battle is the best call back I’ve ever heard, and simply writing about it makes me smile and giggle because it’s so clever and brilliant and perfect and I want to see it again and again. Going into this film and seeing that three hour run time pretty much put me off this film I just couldn’t imagine a scenario where a film could keep me enthralled for such an extended period of time, yet it truly used each minute perfectly, nothing felt as if it dragged on or was unnecessary, and that’s itself confuses me how is that possible. Three hours and I’m stick stuck in my seat begging for another ten, twenty, hell I’d take another hour of it was that good. There were two moments that damn near broke me, and while I won’t go into it, when you see these two scenes you just feel this intense sense of dread and sorrow and it blows me away that I’ve connected with so many of these people who are so far from standard people, and it just shows how real this universe feels, you don’t doubt any of it, you just sit there saying “Of course , of course this is happening”. But they have those moments alongside some truly great comedy, and I’m just think how this one film can get so much feeling out of me. There’s a moment in the final smaller scale fight scene where I’m sat there giddy saying it’s going to happen they’re actually going to do it and then you’re filled with so much pride for paying attention to the smallest details in other films that become huge moments in this epic. The music is also phenomenal, it always adds to the tone and it just punctuates what’s going on so incredibly well and it’s another thing that’s leaving me somewhat speechless because how can I convey how amazing this is without someone understanding exactly what I mean. This film is truly the perfect superhero film, the perfect sequel, and without a doubt one of the greatest films of all time. One last time, go and see this film, go and watch this phenomenal piece in cinema before you hear everyone talking about every detail ruining what would be the perfect way to see this film, because when you know nothing about it, everything and I mean everything feels perfect."},

There are countless opportunities to laugh out loud throughout the three hour movie—our personal favorite was the line “pick a side, Lebowski”—which themselves are perfectly balanced (pun intended) by thrilling action sequences, nostalgic interludes, and genuine moments of sadness. Despite Endgame representing the denouement of the Avengers franchise (and the 22nd film to be released by Marvel Studios for the Marvel Cinematic Universe) the movie itself is also surprisingly self-contained. The only thing anybody would have to know going into the film is that Thanos snapped his fingers at the end of the last installment and half of all living things vanished into dust. Speaking of Thanos, his arc is presented most masterfully of all, far more unexpected and complex than anyone could’ve reasonably guessed. And as of this moment there’s a brilliant Easter Egg on Google celebrating the opening of ‘Avengers: End Game.’ Google “Thanos” then click on the Gauntlet icon containing the infinity stones on the right hand side of the screen.

It has taken the title of \"best MCU film\" away from 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' (2014). Don't worry about spoilers, here's just a summary of the plot(?) and my thoughts on the film. The film pretty much takes place straight after 'Avengers: Infinity War' (2018) where we see our remaining heroes dealing with the loss of half the universe's population after Thanos (Josh Brolin) completely wiped them out with the loaded infinity gauntlet with all six infinity stones. Tony Stark, aka \"Iron Man\" (Robert Downey Jr.) is adrift in space hoping for some good news, while the characters on earth; Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) and even Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) of all people are trying to figure out how to take out the mad titan. The movie is very tonally different from 'Avengers: Infinity War' (2018), in that, it's more somber, and builds up very slowly. The film, as you know, is 3 hours long, anyone who sat through; 'Schindler's List' (1993), 'Titanic' (1997), or even 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' (2003) will tell you this is no big deal. Luckily, this movie's pace is perfect, you're never bored watching it, especially if you've been emotionally invested in the Marvel Universe in the last decade (I guess this means this movie doesn't stand on its own being its one flaw). Once again, directed by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, who have been my favorite directors behind this Cinematic Universe, they know how to balance another busy screenplay penned by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. The film is wildly tense, funny, gripping, and emotionally powerful. It's worthy every moment you wish to see. I really liked seeing these characters going on this big adventure, and now, it's going to be interesting to see where the MCU goes going forward. The cast, once again, commit 100% to their roles, and this film is going to live on for a lifetime. A worthy way to wrap everything up."},

Look for the spoilers on The 602 Club podcast next Tuesday. If you listen to my podcasts or have read this blog, you know I am not afraid to be critical of Marvel movies when I feel it is warranted. Case in point, I felt like Infinity War was, “… a mixed bag that has the effect of one being served a gourmet burger and then only being given a minute to eat it. There is so much happening, yet there’s so little pay off, leaving the audience unfulfilled, wanting a better movie and resolution. We all know the conclusion is coming in 2019, so now that the compulsory is over, we wait and wait and wait.” It was frustrating to feel this way, specifically since I just didn’t feel much about the movie, other than ambivalence and this left me trepidatious for Endgame. So with that preamble, I know you are are all waiting eagerly for my thoughts on the end of the Infinity Stone Saga…. it is satisfying. That’s really what we want after this twenty-one film, eleven year investment, right? We want to be satisfied emotionally and thankfully Endgame is everything Infinity War was not in that department. The movie will capture you from start to finish. Personally I am happy with where my favorite characters are at the end and that is enough. With the three hour run time and the contrivances to overcome Thanos, there are some issues. The movie does feel a bit long, but it also plays out better than Infinity War. Where that movie left you feeling unable to focus because there were so many characters and not a moments rest, Endgame is able to take its time. This may be it’s greatest strength, that you don’t feel rushed, you’re allowed the opportunity to care about what’s happening because you’re not being whiplashed between stories every other minute. For my book, Endgame is the poignantly satisfying conclusion to this part of the Marvel saga I wanted. It is not the perfect movie but it’s the one we deserve.

The thrilling conclusion to the Infinity Stones saga and the Marvel Cinematic Universe as we know it. After the shocking cliffhanger in last year’s, “Infinity War”, the long year wait moved fast and slow all at the same time. Now that we are here, the questions began to flow in. Who lives? Who dies? What happens to the world? All of these questions and more are answered but not in the way you might think or in the most understandable way. The film opens up with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) free-floating in space on the Guardians spacecraft with Nebula (Karen Gillian) after the snap from Thanos (Josh Brolin) and losing Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), and Drax (Batista) on Thanos home planet, Titan. Some humor is added to the mix with both Tony and Nebula playing a game of paper football while waiting for life support to fail. This leads to a monologue with Tony recording a message to Pepper (Gywneth Paltrow) through his helmet. After that, it looks like he is close to death. But, a orange glow overtakes the ship and it’s Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) to the rescue. From there, they are reunited with the team that remains. Fast forward a bit and now they find Thanos, thanks to Nebula. The stones have been destroyed and Thor beheads him. What do our heroes do? Five years later and still no results. The movie petals along for a good solid hour with our heroes trying to find different theories until they realize that time travel is the only option. The first hour of this film does tend to move a bit slower then you traditional Marvel film. We are treated to a very depressing and somber tone with giving each character their moment and what they have been doing over the last five years. The biggest moment by-far is given to Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Beer and time have not been kind to him. Yes that’s what I said, beer. I don’t want to give it away but his appearance generated some of the theater’s funniest laughs. I was glad in this sequence to see a few characters from “Thor: Ragnorak” make a return appearance and see that they are alright. I was really surprised how many laughs were in this film considering where the story is at this time. I think there may have been almost too much funny going on here at times but that may have been just because of the audience that was with me in the theater. Petaling along, we are treated to all of the avengers splitting off into different times to locate all of the stones before Thanos gets them. These were some great sequences and it was great to see some old familiar people from past Marvel films and callbacks to the first avengers film. Time travel is a key part for the whole last two hours of this film and while things to make sense at times, there are also many different plot holes I found too. Some time travel events don’t exactly match up with previous time rules we have seen in other films or what common sense would tell you in these situations. It leads to some convoluted and messy things that still are a bit bothersome especially when five years have passed and at the end of the film, Peter Parker goes back to high school and sees his friend, Ned (Jacob Batalon). How did high school resume for them when five years have passed? I am hoping this is answered in the upcoming “Spider-Man: Far From Home”. The final battle of this film is quite the epic spectacle. Not as big as some of the reviews were hinting because I still believe in the big picture of things that the battles in the previous film were a bit better. Although the moment where all of the avengers assemble here is quite the goosebumps moment. The CGI is nearly flawless in the film with only some moments in the final battle looking a little too green screen. There are a couple of deaths in the film. One of them I was expecting and another not so much. I won’t tell you here but the one I was expecting gets a proper sendoff and it is a good farewell that feels right. I am also pleased that Captain America gets the ending that I always wanted. It’s exactly what I predicted and if you listen to mine and Jason Kobasic’s podcast on the previous film and our first part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe recap, you will know what I mean. This film bookends just about every thread from the previous 21 Marvel films. It couldn’t have been an easy task for the filmmakers to put that together and create something special. They did and everything comes together real nice in the final moments and I loved the final shot. It put a smile on my face and felt very satisfied. I still like “Infinity War” a tad bit better then this one but this is still a great addition and an epic conclusion to these first three phases. Bravo Marvel and we will see you in Phase four and beyond. Grade: B+"},

Avengers: Endgame Russo Brothers docks the universe in one colossal stage where our mighty heroes dances the dance of their life, it is extremely well choreographed. Never has this ever pulled off at such scale, claims Marvel, and Feige proves it, by swooping in every last drop of blood shed in this war. But mind you, it is unlike Infinity War, it never gets too much. There is a certain amount of linearity in their narration that is more focused and polished than the previous installment. It is the ultimate heist, in a sense that it is as big an ambition as the cast is. And so is the storytelling, as rich as the banner goes, the usual baggage of levity that Marvel often failed to own it, comes in natural in here. Split into three acts, this wallop of emotional drama is not the tease for the game but the journey, that Robert Downey Jr. quotes to be proud of. The world of Russo Brothers, is perfectly balanced as Josh Brolin, wanted it to be. What could have been precarious is somehow its best asset, the film is obvious or even obliged to connect the dots. And as much as you feel overridden in this ride, it never grows dull; this overwhelming experience is plastered across the screen for three straight hours that is ought to make the fans giddy up for more. What has been fascinating, is to see, not Thanos turned into a mere pawn of the game, his malleable philosophy is still threatening to the leftover superheroes. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the screenwriters, are free from the stereotypical MCU formulaic structure, it doesn't tap on- a joke, an emotional punch and an actual punch- to the safe beat, they have deconstructed their rhythm for the Endgame, tears are expected, satisfaction; a surprise package."},

It's amazing for a huge movie to be so self-aware of itself, as well as, the movie genres that they're overtly borrowing from. The minor characters or those not even in Avengers: Infinity War, step up and help set up huge sequences that are highly entertaining and actually answer questions. Avengers: Endgame acknowledges every aspect of the characters emotions in their previous MCU film's and succeeds in the most Meta way possible. Ant-Man is a major reason for this. It's no spoiler to say that he's in the film as he produces some of the biggest laughs from the trailer of him ringing the bell at the Avenger's front gate. It's Paul Rudd's wry jokes, quick timing and fish out of water facial expressions that really assist things. The pacing of Avengers: Endgame is amazing and not for the reasons you might think. It's brilliantly paced, but it throws the entire formula and how MCU films are done on their head. Battle, loss, battle, loss, humor and then victory, take those ingredients, shake well and you've got a loose description of some average superhero films. If Avengers: Infinity War left you feeling betrayed and bummed out, I feel you. Avengers: Endgame more than makes up for any ill feelings that it caused. I see why they played it the way they did, and doing so any other way would've cheapened the film, watered down the MCU and made it all disposable. It is also worth noting that the film balance lots of humor with the drama, all the while putting it in a nice bow with stones. What we're left with is a 10 year opus that spans more arcs than Lord of the Rings and encapsulates it all in a perfect manner. Granted, they will still make many MCU films, this is not their swan song. However, there is a victory lap feeling about Avengers: Endgame. It respects the fans, adds to the dramatic elements, answers questions that fans have wondered about and plants a couple new seeds to grow on."},

Captain Marvel was an unwanted intruder into the story of familiar characters and quite often I sighed out loud at the blatant attempts to garner the attention of the media or get awards. Entertainment should be entertainment and whether I agree or disagree with the politics, I would rather they refrain from using a fun action superhero movie as a political platform. The ending alone however is a fitting conclusion to the marvel story and unforgettable though to actually enjoy the film properly you will have needed to have kept up with the majority of the MCU which is one hell of a task and will probably leave you a bit tired of the superhero genre. To improve on this movie they would need to have fixed the pacing at the start of the movie, yes its building up to the conclusion but so has every marvel movie, you don't need 2 hours to explain things. They would get rid of the politics pushing. Captain Marvel should not have suddenly popped up to brag about how strong she was, felt empty and insulting to the original heroes. Also forcing all the female characters to be in one scene for a snapshot for the media might sound like a good idea but one doesnt actually fight and one was meant to be fixing something so it felt distractingly pushed. They also should not have messed with Thor as much as they did and they should not have messed around with the 'strength' of all the heroes.

Directors Joe and Anthony Russo have done a tremendous job in managing so many dozens of characters and making a great movie. Let me start with the bad news. Endgame isn't as impactful as Infinity War, because the 1st movie's Snap that erased countless living beings is about to be undone. Another reason for this is Thanos. In the 1st movie he was a perfectly balanced and well-written villain with a human side. In the latest movie he's been reduced to another blood-thirsty criminal, no different than Ronan the Accuser or Red Skull. I expected to see some more character development and backstory for Thanos, but there was none of that. Still Thanos proves to be more than a match for the heroes in combat, much more so than in Infinity War. Apart from Thanos, everything else in this movie is almost perfect. This is the culmination of 10 years and 21 MCU movies' worth of storytelling. The stakes are so high that nearly every MCU character joins the fight against Thanos' armies. I even expected to see the Kree, the Skrulls, and other cosmic beings such as Dormammu or the Celestials (it has happened in the comics) join the fight against Thanos as well because he's the biggest threat to the Universe, but I guess it would have been too much to ask for. The final battle is as chaotic as those of the Lord of the Rings or other epic blockbuster movies, with a satisfying ending nonetheless. But Endgame is not just fierce battles and non-stop violence. There is plenty of personal drama and tragedies happening, too. Characters confront their past and make amends with it. Others have to grief and keep going. But there is also tons of comedy and fun stuff, as you'd expect from an MCU movie. I could go on and on but I'd spoil things. The myriads of past comic book story references are impressive and touching. Kudos to the many actors involved. Everyone did their best job in this genre-defining movie. But most importantly, the audience in the cinema hall cheered, screamed, \"oooh\"-ed and cried multiple times during the film's many important scenes. Particularly during the late Stan Lee's seemingly last ever cameo. That sense of community and \"we are in it together\" kind of feeling is not something usually found in other movies. Avengers: Endgame isn't the end for the MCU though. It's like the season finale of a TV series before the next one is broadcast later on. It's an episode where things calm down after the climax and story threads are wrapped up before the next adventure begins. The MCU will continue, but Marvel have yet to reveal their plans for the future. For now, there is the Spider-Man: Far From Home movie to wait for."},

I finally had a movie where the Italian Audience reacted to it like an American Audience,and it was glorious. Truly unforgettable. Anywho,the review. Yeah,it’s good. What did you expect? This big culmination of 10 Years worth of 300+ Movies to ****? You must love Jurassic World 2,then. All jokes aside,Avengers Endgame is a beautiful movie that somehow still puts the entire population in the world (Infinity War being just an anticipation of that) as main leads,and still make it a time at the theater full of poetry. Poetry that,for a Marvel movie,is still surrounded by sheer “MCU Formula” stupidity. Not as a whole,though. For a story that lasts 3h2’,this manages to go by pretty fast,like a 50 Minute TV Show Finale,even for one that deals with the casualties that Infinity War had,and just like final franchise movies,they mention almost the entire MCU,right down to the first Iron Man movie being an instrument for the story. The story goes by just like you thought it would go,and much more. Yes,there’s Time Travel (I’m allowed to say it,because other critics mentioned it),yes,there’s the traditional Marvel Formula (even if it lasts for,like,15 minutes in this hulking bowl of Seriousness) and it has a pretty easy structure to follow,which is surprising,considering that 3000 Characters and Time Travel in a Franchise movie are the recipe for a Box Office Flop. Several times they either repeat the same ole’ moment from *Insert MCU Movie name here* or they hint at that. Come to think of it,the structure of the story goes just like how Tony Stark has a great idea and it goes south real fast (remember Age Of Ultron? Good times…). The score by Alan Silvestri is alongside Thor Ragnarok and Black Panther at being the best MCU Score. At parts,it’s reminiscent of Forrest Gump (with the gratuitous melodramatic Violin or a piece mostly composed with Violins like the Theme or “They’re Sending Me To Vietnam”),and like every Final Movie in a Franchise,there are pieces from IW that are repeated in here (“Undying Fidelity”,”Even For You”,there’s a few...). If it has a shot at it (and unless another movie blows me away with that),this better have a Best VFX nom at the Oscars. So many pretty things (and CGI) to talk about in here that I can’t because it’s “Oh So Spoilery!”. But not everything is flawless,as this movie has some flaws that pissed me off A LOT. The First Act of the movie is enjoyable,but there are 2 jokes where they try to modernize it,to the point to where I’ve never thought a Marvel Movie could beat Ferdinand for a Dab joke (and you know I despise those things SO GODDAMN MUCH),and every minute of its runtime is pure Fan Wish Fulfillment,with a big,loud,bombastic 3rd Act that’ll make Nerds real happy. Just let me watch a movie,I don’t need a quote from a comic every 3 Seconds! Thanos got downgraded from the biggest threat of the MCU to “still threatening,but kind of an imbecile”. They try to make him as hateable as someone like Drago Bloodvist (from the How To Train Your Dragon series),but it ends up being a traditional ethic villain that threatens (I MEAN IT) to destroy the entire Galaxy with everything he has (a snap is not enough,huh?),with one decision in general that kinda made me angry,but still hope it’ll improve upon rewatch. Also,if you’re planning on an IMAX watch,see it in 2D,not in 3D. I almost had a headache for 3 hours of 3D Superhero Brawling. But,aside from the jokes,what is there to really complain about? Just for too much Comedy and brutal decisions,I can see someone hating it a-la Last Jedi. SO MANY RISKS TAKEN IN HERE AND I LOVED EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. But still,I had a great time,you’ll have a blast,your family and friends will,and everyone else will enjoy this epic conclusion in a Franchise that,ironically,half the world grew to love as time went by. This ain’t no Spider-Verse,but it’s the best thing the MCU could offer. Besides,I finally got to see an Audience bursting to tears (one girl holding them),so that’s a Big Plus for me. :-D"},

This is a movie that understands its audience and fans, trying to give each character's story closure without forgetting to provide valuable entertainment for the whole crowd. It also might be a tad too cheesy for some people's taste, particularly when there's a comedic relief scene. My biggest concern coming into this movie was the insertion of bland and uninspired jokes that plagued my overall solid experience in \"Infinity War\". This film was an improvement in that regard but it isn't without its cringe-inducing moments. Things like the \"Fortnite\" scene (and more than that I won't say) just made me roll my eyes. It's unbelievable how they manage to overkill it with these comedic scenes that are so painfully unnecessary and do nothing to advance the plot. I understand that you're trying to make your audience have a good time and all, but this is just unbearable. Other than that, the comedy - I thought - worked just nicely for the most part. The jokes that existed didn't ruin the tension. The characters were very central in this movie. Some characters shined; others not so much. I didn't like \"Captain Marvel\" and I certainly don't like the titular character, so I was grateful that she was underused in this movie. Everytime she's on screen and she smiles at the camera, it feels as though the actress is trying to show charisma, but there's none whatsoever. Not that the actress is awful - it's simply that she is not as interesting as the writers are portraying her to be. I know some critics enjoyed Chris Hemsworth's performance and the character, but it's sad to see that the character is reduced to a comedic relief (again). The movie also boasts an impressive budget, with so many set-pieces and computer-generated effects to be observed. This element of the movie provided the writers with so many angles to explore the story. While \"Avengers: Endgame\" is three hours long, the narrative is entertaining enough to overcome the more stale sequences. The movie never feels dull and it keeps you in the edge of your seat. I had a fun time watching it. 7/10."},

The strongest avengers such as Hulk and Thor lose the uniqueness of their power in the movie and they are ridiculized while Captain Marvel is stupidly overpowered.

There are still many more mistakes to talk about but it could spoil some scenes.

Initially, I wanted to give this film an 8 or 9, but now I am thinking 6 or 7 are more appropriate after multiple viewings. Robert Downey Jr. by himself, is one of the main reasons to watch this movie, he is at the top of his game, his character arc is meaningful and impactful, and all of his interactions in the movie are heartfelt and excellently delivered, especially when it comes to conversations with Captain America, Peter Parker, and his own father. This film also boasts a hefty amount of fan service by bringing all of our favourite heroes together for one last time and it was a treat to watch. All the usual character interactions, funny dialogue, and nicely-timed one liners are present and land properly, with minor exceptions, and this movie certainly does make for a bit of an emotional rollercoaster, and I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was. Unfortunately, this film also became littered with plot conveniences, inconsistencies, and holes, the moment it decided to introduce time travel. This is always an incredibly tricky plot device that many movies struggle to implement properly, and this film is no exception. Time travel will always open up a million scenarios of \"Why didn't they do this, at this point, to achieve this?\", and it ultimately hurts the storyline as a result. Some characters also seemed to get worse in this instalment. The Hulk, is now a weird human hulk hybrid who is competent with his science (not enough for time travelling), able to control his temper, and is busy dabbing in cafés. Thor is now an overweight, disheveled shell of his previous self, who spends his time drinking and injecting awful Fortnite and online gaming references that won't age well. Thanos is more of angsty teen with emotional issues, rather than the intellectual and maniacal prophet he was in Infinity War, which was one of my favourite MCU characters. Captain Marvel is back and causes more damage in her 15 minutes of screen time than any superhero ever, big sigh on that one. The big battle was a bit too short for my liking, especially considering the buildup and hype it received from its previous instalments, but was still ultimately entertaining and fun to watch. Also have to mention that outside of Tony Stark, Rocket & Nebula were my favourite performers in this film. Rocket, for the comedy, and Nebula for the internal conflict and character arc. I thought most characters were either average, below average, awful, or did not receive enough screen time to evaluate. + Robert Downey Jr. and his stellar performance + Rocket & Nebula were great characters + Excellent special effects + Emotional character interactions and payoffs + Some well timed humorous moments + Worth the theatre ticket price + Gratuitous fan service - Slow start and awkward pacing - Plot inconsistencies, holes, and conveniences - Over abundance of poorly timed humour moments - Awkward cultural references - Some characters are awful in this - Minor political injections - Captain Marvel Overall, this is a case of the Russo brothers having to do so much within a certain time frame, like closing all the character arcs, and it may have ultimately suffered because of this.

However, this is a really good movie. A little bloated at 3 hours, yes, and it takes almost a full hour to really kick into gear, but they writers/director do an excellent job wrapping things up. Some truly touching moments, and some extremely funny moments. (\"Hello Jeff Lebowsky!\") I though Capt. Marvel was given a short shrift, but I suppose that makes sense given her late entry in the series in general. Clearly, we're not going to be seeing certain character(s) after this film, but I think it's deftly handled for maximum emotional payoff. In my theater, there were belly laughs, cheers, and ugly cries. Can't expect much more than that in a big budget flick, huh?"},
