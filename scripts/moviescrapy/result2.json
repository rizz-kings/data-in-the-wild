True, the story is formulaic but not to the extent that was too distracting. In fact my only two complaint was to do with one performances that didn't quite work personally. And that was Jeremy Renner who was rather on the dull side as Hawkeye, whose character development did seem a little rushed and underwritten, that Hawkeye has inner demons is made very clear but it could have come through more strongly. However the rest of the performances were great, a big shout out going to Tom Hiddleston who is serpentine personified as Loki, though Robert Downey Jnr's charismatic Iron Man, Samuel L. Jackson's no-nonsense Nick Fury, Mark Ruffalo's very confident Hulk(he doesn't make you miss Eric Bana or Ed Norton), Chris Hemsworth's dynamic and not wimpy Thor(if he was I put it down to his hidden demons character development) and Chris Evans' modest, heartfelt Captain America were equally great. Scarlett Johansson convinces mostly too, Black Widow's back story is intriguing and Johansson is wonderful when she acts fearless but when in her emotional, imploring moments her acting is rather forced and out of character for Black Widow. For a film with as many characters as seen here, Avengers Assemble still makes a vast majority of them very interesting(only Hawkeye really disappointed), in character and not one-sided and all of them have their turn to shine. It didn't feel to me like a film that tried to cram in too many heroes all at once for the sake of it. The film is very slickly made with astounding special effects and dazzlingly executed stunt-work. Alan Silvestri's score pulsates with power and the action sequences are exciting. The story may be formulaic and standard good-and-evil but is crisply paced and intelligently handled with just the right blend of humour, pathos and action with not one component over-shadowing the others. What was really enjoyable especially was the toe-to-toe with Thor and Iron Man and Hulk. What was really remarkable was the script, filled with thoughtful exposition and snappy banter that stayed true to The Avengers while also with Joss Whedon's own style that was apparent in a lot of his other work. Overall, Avengers Assemble may not be 100% perfect or among the best ever but it is still an outstanding film with a lot to love about it, and no this is not coming from a fake account or a plant, just someone who can be hard to please who genuinely enjoyed it. 9/10 Bethany Cox"},

The movie nicely culminates the five ones that came before it in the MCU and gives all of the Avengers moments to shine. The action is fantastic, the visuals raise the bar for future MCU films, and the movie ends on a high and satisfying note that leaves plenty of room for future character development and storytelling. The script gives each of the Avengers moments to show us who they are and how they fit into this broader universe. Loki is a great villain for this film due to him being a familiar face and having a direct connection to one of the Avengers, and Tom Hiddleston again gives a strong performance as the character, which is all bolstered by the script giving him a few moments to shine and one-liners as well. The acting in general is good, with both new and familiar faces doing the best they can with their roles. Renner is done a bit dirty in the film, but the big battle redeems that slightly and Renner makes the best of the screen time he has. Unlike some previous MCU movies, this one has lots of rewatch value and will still be entertaining to many on multiple viewings. Overall, The Avengers was a fantastic first culmination for the MCU and set the bar very high for future movies like it."},
{"movie": "the-avengers-2012", "user": "pur__0_0__", "score": "8", "date": "APR 28, 2021", "text": "The Avengers was the first movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that I learnt about. Everyone was going crazy. Meanwhile I, who didn't know the basics of comic book superheroes, was wondering why are Superman, Batman and Spider-Man not on the cover of this movie. Just a few years ago I watched all the movies from the franchise when Infinity War came out just to know what the fuss was all about. And now that I see it, I understand why it was such a huge deal. After the events of Thor, Loki comes on earth to steal the Tesseract from SHIELD, and he does manage to do that. Meanwhile all the superheroes are getting their own relations straight so that they can team up and fight the bad guy. All the characters are shown to be in the places where they had been at the end of their respective movies. Although what they are doing is not very interesting, it is somewhat a realistic deptiction of what kinds of characters they are. And then they all come together, beat Loki and save the day. A pretty straightforward story moved by character development. There are a number of things I like about this movie. The scene where their airship's propeller stops working so Iron Man spins it so fast that it stabilises. It showed how strong and fast Iron Man is. There was also the scene where Iron Man goes through the portal and throws the missile away. It completely contradicts what Captain America considered him to be, showing how his character developed over the duration of the movie. I also like how Tony goes to have a word with Loki and tells him that the Avengers have a Hulk against his entire army. I mean I could literally go on about what a badass Iron Man was throughout the movie. Then there were Thor and Hulk. I really liked Thor ever since I first heard of him. He literally looks like a Norse god capable of highly destructive powers. Hulk, on the other hand, I didn't like him very much when I heard about him. Even in The Incredible Hulk he wasn't really entertaining. But here he actually feels like a very strong guy who has been trapped in the body of Bruce Banner. He gets angry every time someone calls him Bruce instead of Hulk, which shows how much he is struggling for his identity. Thor is just as awesome as I thought him to be. I always have a soft spot for superheroes who wear a cape. The visual effects were done really nicely. Though the impact of their powers wasn't very hard, but it's a campy movie. What can we possibly expect? It's from an era where every fight scene needed to have a comic relief who would tell jokes in the middle of the fight, be it Gimli from Lord of the Rings, Jar Jar Binks from Star Wars or Hound from Transformers. But the destruction was surely visible. Most of the shots are done from the point of view of a bystander. That is something I really like; it's literally the reason why I like Monsterverse. It is seen especially in the scene where Hulk rides the giant snake robot. Though there are a lot of things that I didn't like about this movie. First of all, the campiness. Obviously in today's time it's quite an easy thing to dismiss saying that back in 2012 movies were meant to be campy as the superhero genre hadn't been utilised properly, but the very same year The Dark Knight Rises came and the next year Man of Steel came. Both of them had the mature touch to it. Even the MCU movies before and after this one like Thor and Captain America: The Winter Soldier looked more mature than this baby thing. The other criticism I have towards this is Black Widow and Hawkeye. I hate botht he characters, and even more I hate how they are easily beating bad guys who are clearly stronger than them. The jump cuts of this movie are also very annoying. Every fight scene, especially the ones which have Black Widow in them, have like, a dozen scene cuts just to show that Natasha did a cartwheel, got on the bad guy's shoulders and snapped his neck. The same goes for Captain America and Hawkeye also. Not even once has Hawkeye shot anything in one take. It's something that can be easily shown even with a stunt double. Obviously this doesn't look special anymore, since I watched it after Infinity War had released, so there wasn't much of a surprise other than the fact that it's a team up movie. It has a good place in my memory so I wouldn't want to rewatch it and tamper its reputation. It's good in its place, it's a product of its time. It should stay that way. It's a one time watch in case you haven't seen it."},

I was expecting wall-to-wall action, pretty much from the start - especially given the forces that join together. However, I felt the first half of 'The Avengers' as slow. What also didn't help is that the villain, carried over from a preceding MCU film, isn't super interesting - we also don't see the antagonist's earlier film counterpart for a fair few scenes, which felt too delayed. The last half is much better, which allowed me to enjoy myself properly. Robert Downey Jr., while not as entertaining as he is on his own, brings goodness, as do the likes of Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth. I'm not a big fan of recasts, though Mark Ruffalo as Hulk is a positive one; even if that took a bit away from the novelty of all the superheroes joining, given we hadn't seen Ruffalo himself before. Added to Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, at least in terms of the film franchise, getting major screen time out of nowhere - having been a bit part character in her debut MCU appearance.

But Joss Whedon pulled it off effortlessly. This was a fantastic end to phase one with some great action and great story telling. Loki as the villain was a great touch as he performed perfectly. Having all these heroes interact for the first time on screen was special. This film is very easy to rewatch over and over."},

For the first part, they probably didn't expect what success is behind this series. The story is excellent. Especially ingenious in how Marvel managed to connect all the superheroes nicely and make a film about them. The work was probably not easy to make a movie with so many superheroes, but it worked. Every superhero has a moment here and it doesn't seem overpaid. The story is excellent and the main villain Loki is, in my opinion, one of the best villains Marvel has ever had. Overall, this is an excellent action spectacle that I can recommend."},

Joss Whedon perfectly manages a large group of charasmatic characters with big egos played by an amazing cast of actors. After phase 1 we are treated to this incredible, inspired battle royale. The mischievous Loki (Hiddleston) with some mysterious influence attacks New York with a galactic army of Aliens. Good thing sassy Iron Man played by an amazing Robert Downey Jr., mega hunky with inspired comic timing Thor (Hemsworth), sexy Hawkeye (Renner), the fierce Hulk (Ruffalo) and gorgeous all American boy Captain America (Evans). But the real scene stealer here is a kick ass, smart, fantastically executed Black Widow played by Scarlett Johansson. The movie is definitely one of the best of it's kind as well as being one of the most entertaining ever made. Budget: $220m Box Office: $1.519b 10/10"},

Diversos elementos nesse filme funcionam muito bem. Temos personagens que, por si só, já são interessantes e carismáticos, e esse até então não era o desafio. Acontece que o roteiro sabe muito bem como conduzir a visão de cada um sem que isso parecesse forçado, na realidade, até se acrescenta ao personagem. Isso fica muito mais evidente para quem assistiu os filmes subsequentes e percebe muito bem referências que são, na realidade, futuras a trama. Loki é super carismático e fez com que amássemos o odiar, ocupando perfeitamente o papel do vilão. O início da relação entre o Cap. América e Tony Stark é no mínimo intrigante, e cada um parece ter sua verdade em determinados momentos. Se tem uma coisa que funciona bem aqui é o alívio cômico. Nos pega em momentos certeiros, são bem engraçados e quebra o clima pesado - que não é o propósito do filme. As cenas de luta são boas de modo geral, com claro destaque aquelas onde o plano é mais aberto e se utilizam dois ou mais heróis, combinando seus poderes; é lindo e extremamente satisfatório de se ver. A OST é marcante e funcional. Emociona e representa muito bem a equipe. Os efeitos especiais são excelentes para a época e convencem muito bem."},
